            "task_description": "The objective of this project is to determine whether the reduced mechanical forces associated with microgravity lead to osteoarthritis.\nAlthough the effects of microgravity on bone are well known and appear to be reversible, the effects reduced mechanical forces on the cartilage surfaces of articulating joints are less well understood. Studies in humans and animals clearly demonstrate that osteoarthritis results from abnormal (both increased and decreased) mechanical forces on cartilage. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that appropriate mechanical forces are critical for the health of articular cartilage. Following on from this, we further hypothesize that the absence of significant biomechanical forces affects that ability of the chondrocyte to maintain healthy functioning cartilage. This may lead to accelerated cartilage breakdown and osteoarthritis.\nThere have been no studies that specifically investigate whether microgravity results in the degeneration of articular cartilage. Articular cartilage breakdown could be a major consequence of long-term space travel because, unlike bone, once cartilage degradation begins it cannot be reversed, typically leading to osteoarthritis. The mobility of an individual affected by even mid-stage osteoarthritis would be compromised leading to a failure to complete the full range of mission duties.\nThe availability of joint tissue exposed to an extended period of microgravity is an ideal opportunity to address these hypotheses. Therefore, we have designed a focused Aim that will examine the joints of mice returned from microgravity for altered gene and protein expression and evidence of cartilage breakdown. This will be achieved using a range of robust and well-established methods including histology for joint surface integrity, immunohistochemistry using antibodies against a range of cartilage proteins, and gene expression analysis tools.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "We expect to determine whether cartilage degradation occurs in space. In essence, we are looking at the changes that occur under conditions of altered biomechanical forces. The effects of increased biomechanical forces have been documented for many years but the effects of greatly reduced biomechanical forces are largely unknown.  We expect that these studies will provide new insights into mechano-sensitive pathways in chondrocytes, the cells that make cartilage. This in turn may lead to the development of novel therapies and treatment options for patients with osteoarthritis and other conditions where biomechanical forces on the joint are altered."

            "task_progress": "This grant supported research involving NASA's 15-day STS-131 flight and the 30-day Russian Bion-M1 mission.\nMechanical forces are critical for maintaining healthy articular cartilage. Altering the mechanical forces on weight-bearing articulating joints accelerates articular cartilage degeneration leading to osteoarthritis. Conversely, the lack of mechanical forces also leads to osteoarthritis. It is clear, therefore, that normal mechanical forces are critical for the health and maintenance of articular cartilage.\nThe long-term objective of this project is to understand the effects of microgravity on articular cartilage and specifically, whether the absence of significant mechanical forces due to microgravity results in cartilage breakdown. The presence of spaceflight-related cartilage degradation will impact multiple aspects of skeletal biology related to the failure to accommodate dynamic load, such as joint damage, bone fragility, and muscle atrophy.\nSummary of STS-131 findings: 15 days exposure to microgravity: For the STS-131 mission, animals were subjected to 15 days of microgravity and the joints harvested three hours following landing. There was no difference in toluidine blue staining between flight and ground articular cartilage. We conclude that 15 days exposure to microgravity does not alter proteoglycan content of articular cartilage in mouse knee joints.  miRNA data: Bioinformatic analysis of the miRNA data demonstrated that 10 miRNAs were upregulated (p>0.001) and 26 were downregulated in flight compared to control mice.\nmRNA data: Thirteen mRNAs were upregulated >1.5 fold in flight compared to the ground control animals and one downregulated >1.5 fold. Of the 13 upregulated genes, 7 have been implicated in either osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or both.\nSummary of Bion-M1 findings: Effects on cartilage of 30 days exposure to microgravity. There was significant proteoglycan loss, as shown by reduced toluidine staining in the knee cartilage of flight animals compared to the non-flight animals (p=0.008, students t-test). Interestingly, many of the chondrocytes within the middle zone remain blue. Despite this proteoglycan degradation, no clear structural changes to the articular cartilage surface of the flight mice were present suggesting that, with 30 days of unloading, the collagen II network remains intact.\nConclusions\nExtensive literature exists in humans and in animal models suggesting that a normal range of biomechanical forces is required for cartilage homeostasis. Consistent with this is our finding that the reduced biomechanical environment of microgravity induces cartilage breakdown. Although there was no proteoglycan loss after 15 days of microgravity on STS-131, there is clear evidence of proteoglycan loss after 30 days on Bion. In addition, the mRNA changes in Bion are consistent with reduced cartilage matrix synthesis and further support the finding that cartilage atrophy occurs in spaceflight.\nBased on these data we speculate that the maintenance of biomechanical loading during spaceflight will reduce cartilage destruction. We believe exercise is the countermeasure.\nSeveral publications are in preparation for submission to peer-reviewed journals.",

            "task_description": "Mycobacteria are bacteria that are found in water, vegetation, dust, and soil, and certain types such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live and replicate only in cells that work to protect an animal or human. These immune cells are called macrophage, and M. tuberculosis is the cause of tuberculosis in humans. Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium marinum can also cause human disease as they too can live and survive inside macrophage. M. marinum causes a skin infection, where as M. avium has been linked with pulmonary infections. M. marinum and M. avium are two of the types of mycobacterium species that live in water. M. avium has been found in drinking water even after extensive chemical treatment of water systems, and was identified in water samples taken from the Russian space station Mir. All of these types of mycobacterium form biofilms and biofilms have been found on surfaces in the space station.  A biofilm is formed when microorganisms assemble together and are enclosed by a protective film resulting in resistance to disinfecting agents or drug treatments. Since it is more difficult to kill bacteria in biofilms, human mycobacterium infections could be a problem during extended space flight. Human mycobacterium infections from M. avium, M. marinum, and even M. tuberculosis are more of a problem when the body is less able to fight infection, as in the case of AIDS patients on Earth. This is also an issue for space travel as astronauts have been found to have compromised immune systems. Studies have also demonstrated increased growth, thicker biofilm formation as well as an increase in virulence of other types of bacteria grown under microgravity to model space conditions.\nThe aim of this work is to determine whether mycobacteria have enhanced virulence during space travel and what mechanisms they use to adapt to microgravity. We will use M. marinum as a model mycobacterium species, as its optimal growth is at 30-33°C and it is less problematic in terms of causing serious human infections. M. marinum also infects fish, and this provides a future small animal model for both ground-based studies and possible experiments on the International Space Station. We therefore hypothesize that M. marinum grown under conditions of microgravity will be more infectious in terms of entry and survival inside macrophage cells, and that this will be achieved by altering gene expression to promote survival under stressful conditions. Oxygen has been found to play a role in altering gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown during space flight, and Salmonella enterica are more resistance to oxidative stress when grown under microgravity. We hypothesize that genes involved in surviving oxidative stress will be induced in M. marinum grown under microgravity. M. marinum grown under microgravity and normal gravity will be tested for their ability to infect and survive in macrophage, for resistance to hydrogen peroxide and for gene expression changes stimulated by microgravity. Specific mutant strains defective in detoxification processes, damage repair, or biofilm formation will also be generated and if time allows will also be tested for survival in macrophage after growth under microgravity. This one year proposal will therefore build on existing knowledge and will be used to develop a three year space biology grant. This will further extend our understanding of mycobacteria pathogenicity during space travel and potentially reveal mechanisms to target mycobacterium infections in space and on Earth. The proposed work is therefore consistent with the objectives of the NASA Space Biology Program.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Mycobacterium marinum is a waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria. It can infect humans on the skin, but is a good model for other human pathogenic mycobacteria (Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that result in serious human lung infections. This work examined the stress response of M. marinum when grown under microgravity. By comparing the changes in gene expression this work suggests that the stress responses turned on during growth under simulated microgravity are similar to those found in M. tuberculosis inside human immune cells. The data suggests that a protein called SigH may be involved in the alteration of the stress response genes. This work therefore suggests that if we can identify a way of preventing growth under simulated microgravity we may be able to apply this knowledge to identifying drugs to prevent survival of pathogenic mycobacteria in humans on Earth and aid in the treatment of lung infections caused by pathogenic mycobacteria."

            "task_progress": "The objective of this proposal was to determine whether waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria alter gene expression, become resistant to stress, and are more infectious when grown under low shear simulated microgravity (MG). Mycobacterium marinum was the model organism used in this study. This is a bacterium that naturally infects fish and amphibians to produce a tuberculosis-like disease in a variety of organs. In humans, M. marinum can cause a disease known as swimming pool granuloma, which is restricted to the skin due to the lower temperature of body extremities. The pathology is similar to dermal Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and the infection route is through cuts or abrasions. Infection is usually limited to the skin in humans since M. marinum grows at 28-35°C. M. marinum infects and survives inside immune cells called macrophage by the same mechanisms as M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium. M. tuberculosis and M. avium cause serious lung infections in humans.  M. marinum is therefore a good model to understand how these pathogenic mycobacteria survive and adapt to the hostile environment inside macrophage. Since M. marinum and M. avium exist in the environment on Earth and can form biofilms in water systems, it is important to understand the effect of microgravity on these pathogenic mycobacteria as they could exist in the water systems on space vehicles.\nM. marinum and LHM4 (a derivative of M. marinum carrying a plasmid encoding kanamycin resistance and red fluorescent protein) were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARV) in a rotary cell culture system (RCCS) under normal gravity (NG) or MG. By following the optical density of the culture as well as the colony forming units per milliliter we determined that the growth of both strains was altered by growth under MG once the culture was in exponential phase. There was no difference in the growth for ~40 hrs (early exponential phase) but the growth of the MG culture was significantly slower after 40 hrs. The doubling time during early exponential was 6 hrs and after 40 hrs this increased to ~8 hrs for the NG culture and to ~15 hrs for the MG culture. We hypothesized that the slowing of growth may have been due to an oxidative stress in the bacteria. Hydrogen peroxide can cross membranes and so we repeated the growth studies adding catalase to the culture. Any hydrogen peroxide exiting the bacteria and existing in the medium would be detoxified by the catalase. This did not however improve the growth of the M. marinum under MG.\nTo determine the effect of MG on the stress responses activated by the growth conditions, we used RNAseq to examine what genes were expressed. For RNAseq, the bacteria are harvested, RNA isolated and converted DNA (cDNA), and the cDNA sequenced. Using bioinformatics, the amount of expression of the different M. marinum genes were compared between the NG and MG samples. To make sure that we were examining only gene expression changes due to MG, only bacteria in early exponential growth were used in the RNAseq studies. Triplicate NG and MG cultures were used to generate samples of bacteria grown for ~40 hrs. We also grew triplicate cultures for 4 days and then diluted them again and grew them for another ~40 hrs so we could examine gene expression from bacteria exposed for a longer time. From these studies it was obvious that stress response pathways were activated in the MG cultures and the stress responses were at a higher expression level the longer they were exposed to MG. Expression seemed to change to be similar to responses of M. tuberculosis inside macrophage. This suggests that the MG stress was similar to that of mycobacteria inside immune cells. Using the MG growth conditions may be useful in the future to test drugs designed to kill mycobacteria during infection. We are in the process of identifying regulator proteins that may be involved in aiding mycobacteria survival under MG.\nPublished studies indicate that other species of bacteria show altered resistance to hydrogen peroxide and acid (pH 3.5) once grown under MG. We tested our LHM4 strain and determined that as found for other bacteria M. marinum are more sensitive to killing by hydrogen peroxide but do not alter their resistance to acid conditions once grown under MG. M. marinum sensitivity to gamma radiation did not change also. This type of study may aid in designing disinfection techniques for future space travel.\nSince this was a 1 year grant there was limited time to test the survival capabilities of the M. marinum inside immune cells. An initial study did suggest that the M. marinum grown under MG have a growth advantage inside the immune cells during the first 2 days. More work is required to confirm these results.\nIn summary, this study determined that waterborne mycobacteria alter their growth, expression of stress responses, and their sensitivity to oxidizing conditions when subjected to growth under MG.  We can now use these results to identify important proteins required for adaptation to growth and survival under MG and this may aid in the design of new disinfection procedures and drugs to prevent human infection during space travel.",

            "task_description": "This research has capitalized on a rapid turn-around spaceflight opportunity and the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFU) hardware to address how spaceflight affects gene expression related to low oxygen/hypoxic response in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root zone hypoxia is thought develop in spaceflight as weightlessness leads to a reduction in the buoyancy-driven convection that usually aids in gas exchange around organisms. This in turn leads to the development of oxygen-limiting conditions with adverse effects on plant vigor and yields.\nOur analysis of Ca2+ signaling responses and associated gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis indicates Ca2+ signaling is linked to hypoxic response in plants. We have identified a suite of Ca2+-dependent proteins that show rapid transcriptional responses to anoxia in both roots and shoots. Mutants in two such genes, aca1-2, and cax2-2 (both Ca2+ transporters) are resistant to hypoxic challenge. These mutants also show disrupted gravitropic response suggesting that Ca2+ signaling may provide a point of cross-talk between the anoxic and gravity response systems.\nWe therefore compared growth and gene expression patterns in cax2-2, and wild-type plants grown on the ground and ion the International Space Station. Seedlings were grown on orbit and fixed in RNAlater for subsequent analysis. Differences in the of gene expression were analyzed post-flight by a combination of RNAseq and qPCR analyses. Comparison to ground-based controls maintained under normal and varying degrees of low oxygen conditions at 1xG, have been used to ask how much of the responses seen on orbit can be explained by development of low oxygen conditions around the plants due to microgravity conditions.\nResults from this analysis are not only helping advance our understanding of the development of anoxic response in space and on the Earth but also test whether the Ca2+ signaling system provides targets for genetically engineering potential countermeasures to this stress.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is addressing how low oxygen sensing operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent signaling machinery of the plant root. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how low oxygen levels impact plant growth in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. The low oxygen sensing/response systems triggered by anoxic conditions in space are also those employed by plants challenged by low oxygen on Earth, such as during flooding of the soil or intense soil microbe respiration that locally depletes oxygen around the plant. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how Ca2+ signaling is involved in the low oxygen response induced during spaceflight is also revealing a role for this system in this general flooding/low oxygen response system. These results are providing novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant growth to varied soil oxygen status, such as promoting flooding tolerance in crop plants."

            "task_progress": "FLIGHT:\nThis project has completed the flight, sample recovery, and sample analysis phases.\nThe experimental setup for the BRIC-17 experiment was using surface sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis plated on nutrient agar medium in 60 mm Petri dishes (4 plates of wild-type and 3 each of two anoxia-related CAX2 Ca2+ transporter mutants). The sterile plates were then loaded into Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) and 5 PDFUs plus a HOBO data logger secured inside each of two of the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware. Germination was delayed by holding the BRIC at 4°C until the hardware was installed on the International Space Station (ISS). Germination was then started by warming the equipment to room temperature. After 8 days at room temperature, the crew injected RNAlater fixative into the PDFUs and the following day, the canisters were placed in the MELFI freezer onboard the ISS at -95°C. Samples were returned using the Dragon capsule in a -32°C Cold Bag, de-integrated, and transported frozen to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for further analysis. All flight procedures were completed successfully.\nPOSTFLIGHT ANALYSIS:\nSeedling growth was assessed from digital images of the thawed seedlings. A small but significant (P<0.05, t-test) redirection from shoot to root growth was observed in the spaceflight wild type plants versus the ground-based controls. This reallocation of growth was missing in the cax2-3 mutant suggesting this line may be resistant to some of the stresses of spaceflight that are responsible for remodeling growth in wild type.\nTRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING:\nAll samples were dissected into root and shoot and all yielded sufficient quantity 12-36 µg/plate and quality of RNA for both quantitative PCR and whole genome transcriptional analyses to monitor gene expression.\nIsolated RNA was sent to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotech Center who performed ribosomal RNA reduction, library construction, and RNAseq-based transcriptome profiling for whole genome gene expression analysis. The complete raw data-set from this RNAseq analysis was mapped to the TAIR version 10 of the Arabidopsis genome using the Tuxedo protocols. These transcriptional patterns were then analyzed for over-represented classes of genes.\nAnalysis of genes induced >5-fold indicated 38 genes were up-regulated in spaceflight in wild-type and in the cax2 mutant plants relative to ground controls, implying a core set of spaceflight-related genes. These genes cover a range of functions from hormone response genes to those related to oxidative stress. In addition, the induction of 210 other genes was suppressed in the cax2 mutants relative to wild type, suggesting these are targets of a CAX2-dependent machinery that is triggered by spaceflight, and so strong candidates for genes that are part of the spaceflight anoxic response that is triggered by the CAX2 protein. In addition, 329 genes were up-regulated in both cax2 mutants but not in wild type plants. As both of these CAX2 mutants are resistant to low oxygen stress on Earth, these up-regulated genes represent strong candidates for potential hypoxia resistance genes. Many of these genes are also elevated in the CAX2 mutant backgrounds in the ground controls but are further increased by the spaceflight environment. Analysis of this subset of genes using the GOrilla gene ontology analysis tool revealed significant enrichment in genes related to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and biotic stress responses.",

            "task_description": "This project has accomplished one of its two milestones, and the updated summary provided now reflects not only the conceptual genesis of the project, but also as it was refined as the project progressed. While, of course, the original essence remains, what is presented here is the summit of the first milestone, and precedes previous reports. This milestone is concerned with Earth studies to develop and rigorously test the technology for determining the sensitivity of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) during spaceflight, and to elucidate the genetic basis of whatever change is seen. The second milestone is experimentation during the spaceflight itself, which was launched in late 2017.\nA paper entitled: “Payload hardware and experimental protocol development to enable future testing of the effect of space microgravity on the resistance to gentamicin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and its (sigma)s-deficient mutant,” was published online in May 2017: Life Sciences in Space Research 15 (2017) 1–10 2214-5524/ © 2017 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Published by Elsevier Ltd.; [\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001\n] As has been pointed out before, this project represents highly collaborative and collegial collaboration between Stanford and NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The published paper reflects this not only by the joint authorship of it by both Stanford and Moffett Field scientists, but also the benefits that accrue from collaboration between biological expertise (Stanford) and the flight technological expertise (Moffett Field).\nThe list of authors is as follows: AC Matin, J-H Wang, Mimi Keyhan, Rachna Singh, and Michael Benoit of the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford School of Medicine; and Macarena P. Parra, Michael R. Padgen, Antonio J. Ricco, Matthew Chin, Charlie R. Friedericks, Tori N. Chinn, Aaron Cohen, Michael B. Henschke, Timothy V. Snyder, Matthew P. Lera, Shannon S. Ross, Christina M. Mayberry, Sungshin Choi, Diana T. Wu, Ming X. Tan, Travis D. Boone, Christopher C. Beasley, and Stevan M. Spremo, of NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA.   The abstract of this paper, reproduced here (in quotes), succinctly describes the evolved conceptual background, and demonstrates in detail the development of the EcAMSat platform, and its thorough testing using spaceflight-like commands.\n“Human immune response is compromised and bacteria can become more antibiotic resistant in space microgravity (MG). We report that under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), stationary-phase uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) become more resistant to gentamicin (Gm), and that this increase is dependent on the presence of s (a transcription regulator encoded by the rpoS gene). UPEC causes urinary tract infections (UTIs), reported to afflict astronauts; Gm is a standard treatment, so these findings could impact astronaut health. Because LSMMG findings can differ from MG, we report preparations to examine UPEC’s Gm sensitivity during spaceflight using the E. coli Anti-Microbial Satellite (EcAMSat) on a free-flying “nanosatellite” in low Earth orbit. Within EcAMSat’s payload, a 48-microwell fluidic card contains and supports study of bacterial cultures at constant temperature; optical absorbance changes in cell suspensions were made at three wavelengths for each microwell and a fluid-delivery system provided growth medium and predefined Gm concentrations. Performance characterization is reported here for spaceflight prototypes of this payload system. Using conventional microtiter plates, we show that Alamar Blue (AB) absorbance changes can assess the Gm effect on E. coli viability, permitting telemetric transfer of the spaceflight data to Earth. Laboratory results using payload prototypes are consistent with wellplate and flask findings of differential sensitivity of UPEC and its delta rpoS strain to Gm. if (sigma)s plays the same role in space MG as in LSMMG and Earth gravity, countermeasures discovered in recent Earth studies (aimed at weakening the UPEC antioxidant defense) to control UPEC infections would prove useful also in space flights. Further, EcAMSat results should clarify inconsistencies from previous space experiments on bacterial antibiotic sensitivity and other issues.” The manuscript may be consulted for further details and all the relevant references; see Bibliography section in 2017 report.\nIn addition, the work has brought to light issues, such as the stress exerted by the flight equipment on bacteria, which we are now in the process of elucidating and ameliorating for the development of better future platforms for spaceflight experimentation on bacterial biology, resistance, and virulence.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is becoming an extremely serious problem on Earth that impacts space travelers harder given the deleterious effect of microgravity on human immune response. The research has confirmed the hypothesis that underpinned it, and has shown the way to enhance effectiveness of antibiotics in general. Subsequent work, which is in progress, has identified compounds whose co-administration with antibiotics will enhance their curative power; these can also permit lowering the needed amount of antibiotics for treating infections, thereby minimizing their side effects. This promises to improve life in space as well as on Earth."

            "task_progress": "The spaceflight took place onboard a free-flying “nanosatellite,” which, for the first time utilized a 6-U configuration (a “U” being a 10-cm cube). The experiments were conducted on the EcAMSat hardware platform that we developed and described previously in the task book reports. Cell viability in this platform was measured by changes in the absorption of the dye Alamar Blue (AB); these were telemetered to Earth and recorded by daily communications with the spacecraft at Santa Clara University. Parallel ground controls were run. The flight performed very smoothly and all the needed data were successfully obtained. The major conclusion from the results is that the gene rpoS continues to play a critical role in making urinary pathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) highly resistant to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm). This antibiotic is used to treat urinary tract infections often reported in astronauts. Therefore, the potential small molecule inhibitors that we have identified (using bioinformatics approaches) of the protein encoded by rpoS and the antioxidant proteins it controls hold the promise to promote astronaut health in spaceflights. That these molecules are valuable also in meeting the rampant bacterial antibiotic resistance on Earth has been pointed out before.\nA second important finding is that the high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs) used to simulate microgravity on Earth did indeed provide correct information of UPEC biology in this respect because it is with the use of this system that we had first discovered the rpoS role in Gm resistance. The cumulative work on this grant earned the entire EcAMSat team individual NASA awards.\nThe publication  concerning this work will be submitted within the coming weeks.",

            "task_description": "Plants provide a complete and economical means for human life support for long-term space exploration and habitation. However, since the space environment is not optimal for plant growth, an understanding of how plants sense and respond to changes in their environment is of fundamental importance. The phosphoinositide (PI) pathway is highly conserved among eukaryotes and functions in the regulation of a multitude of cellular pathways. The lipid-derived second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) increases in response to many different stresses. We have shown that InsP3 levels increase with gravistimulation prior to visible bending in both monocot and dicot systems. We have generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the mammalian type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes InsP3 and terminates the signal. The transgenic plants have normal growth and morphology; however, they exhibit altered responses to many environmental stimuli including gravity, drought, and cold. While rapid changes in transcript levels occur in wild type Arabidopsis within 5 min of gravistimulation, the expression of several of the fastest responding genes does not change in the InsP 5-ptase roots in response to reorientation.\nOur hypothesis is that InsP3 is an important second messenger in the sensing and signaling of stimuli (including gravity). The plants with compromised InsP3 signaling therefore provide a valuable tool for dissecting the role of the InsP3 pathway in plant responses to the microgravity environment encountered on the International Space Station.\nOur primary aim is to identify the molecular changes that are specifically mediated by InsP3 in the space environment. We will compare transcript and protein profiles of wild type and transgenic plants that are grown in both microgravity and 1g in space as well as on the ground. The long term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms plants use to sense and respond to changes in their environment. This knowledge will help design plants which are better able to withstand space flight and microgravity conditions.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants provide a good model system for understanding several issues including plant responses to gravity, plant responses to environmental stress, and fundamental aspects of PI signaling. Our previous work has implicated InsP3 as a key player in gravity sensing and signaling and the transgenic plants have attenuated InsP3 signaling and reduced gravitropism.  In addition these plants have altered responses to different environmental stresses.  Therefore this study will help us understand plant signaling during environmental stress, which has long term implications with improving crops to better withstand unfavorable conditions. Furthermore, the phosphoinositide pathway is highly conserved among plants, yeast, and mammals. These studies using the transgenic plants with attenuated InsP3 signaling will provide valuable insights on the regulation and downstream effectors of this pathway and could also contribute to our understanding of the role of the PI pathway in regulating human physiology."

            "task_description": "A major challenge in mitigating infectious disease risks during spaceflight is to understand, model, and integrate the combined action of cellular, molecular, and biochemical networks in the host that potentiate transition to disease in response to infection by pathogens cultured in microgravity. This is a critical issue to address, as spaceflight negatively impacts crew immune function and alters microbial virulence, gene expression, and antimicrobial resistance, strongly suggesting an increased risk for in-flight infectious disease. Herein, we propose to apply our 3-D intestinal co-culture models as human surrogates to characterize their transcriptomic (via RNA-Seq), metabolomic (via mass spectrometry), and inflammatory responses to infection with spaceflight analogue and control-cultured Salmonella typhimurium. To facilitate a practical integration of these systems, the combined analysis proposed in this study will focus on the metabolomic subset associated with host oxidative stress, redox, and inflammatory responses. These factors are of key importance in the infection process and may contribute to reported abnormalities and dysfunction in the crews' immune system during flight. We will use systems modeling approaches based on both quantitative gene transcript and biochemical metabolite correlation and all of their known/inferable relationships between genes, proteins, pathways, and biochemistry that will allow us to form new bridges and a general framework for making these linkages between gene expression (RNA-Seq) and biochemical (metabolomic) data. This approach will allow for new insights into relationships between redox functions, oxidative stress, inflammation, and infection that either approach alone would not be able to achieve. By exploring interconnections between these systems over different kinetic timepoints before and after infection, this systematic approach will provide an unparalleled level of sensitivity and resolution of the dynamics of the host response to a microgravity-analogue cultured pathogen, which may lead to identification of novel infection mechanisms and strategies for prevention and control.",

            "task_description": "The long-term goal of this research is to identify and characterize mechanisms of plant vacuole biogenesis that are critical for gravity perception. A role of the vacuole in controlling gravity perception is well accepted, but the molecular mechanisms by which the vacuole interacts with amyloplasts or regulates their sedimentation during gravitropism are yet to be identified. We recently uncovered a novel vacuole phenotype in agravitropic mutant alleles of VTI11 in Arabidopsis. We predict that this vacuole phenotype of vti11 mutants has negative effects on the organization of actin cables or the cortical endoplasmic reticulum, and therefore prevents amyloplast sedimentation. In addition, we have uncovered a novel regulation of vacuolar membrane fusion by phosphoinositides. Based on our results, we developed the hypothesis that mechanisms of vacuole remodeling that are mediated by phosphoinositide signaling are critical for the perception or transduction of the gravitropic signal in plants. A unique assay for vacuole fusion that we developed will be used to determine the role of specific cellular components in membrane fusion and gravity perception. The specific aims of this research project are to: 1) Determine subcellular phenotypes that impair gravity perception in itt3/vti11. 2) Identify the role of phosphoinositides in gravitropism.  3) Determine the role of the Adaptor Protein (AP-3) complex on vacuole biogenesis and gravitropism.\nOverall, this research will improve our understanding of vacuole biogenesis, the interactions between the vacuole and other cellular components involved in gravity perception, and the role of phosphoinosidides in gravitropism.",

            "task_description": "Plants are exquisitely sensitive to mechanical stimulation which triggers changes ranging from widespread alteration in patterns of gene expression to profound shifts in development. Indeed, so pervasive is the mechanical stimulation from internal and external forces, such as the weight of tissues and organs, to a biology that has evolved under a constant 1xG, that the resultant signaling is thought to provide a required regulatory background to control a wide range of plant developmental and physiological processes. Despite this acknowledged role in plant morphogenesis, the overall contribution of such mechanical cues to plant function remains poorly defined, largely due to the difficulties in removing the pervasive 1xG-driven mechanical signal when conducting experiments on Earth. The microgravity environment of the International Space Station (ISS) therefore provides a unique tool to both directly address this hypothesis of mechanical load-driven morphogenesis, as well as to ask what features of plant growth in space reflect disruption of this mechano-signaling regulatory network. We have therefore grown seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana on board the ISS using the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFU) hardware. We are comparing their patterns of growth and gene expression to ground-based controls to ask how the well-defined \"fingerprints\" of mechanical response are altered in space. In addition, we are characterizing plants grown in space whose mechanical signaling has been artificially activated or inhibited by mutations in a gene (TCH2) which has an established role in the mechanical signaling system of plants. Results from such analyses will address the fundamental question of the role of mechanical loading on plant growth and development on Earth as well as probing how manipulating this system through targeting specific mechanoresponse genes might be used to tailor plant growth to thrive in the unique environment of spaceflight.\nThis experiment has also been supplemented with a parallel GeneLab experiment to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. These variants (ecotypes) have been chosen to span the range of likely ecotypes to be used in future spaceflight experimentation and so will provide key baseline comparisons to help understand the impact of ecotypic makeup on responses to spaceflight.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is addressing how mechanical sensing operates in plants using Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse Ear Cress). The work targets the Ca2+-dependent signaling machinery and a specific element of this machinery, a gene named touch-2, also known as calmodulin-like 24 (CML24). The patterns of growth and gene expression of wild type and mutants in CML24 grown on the International Space Station (ISS) are being compared to paired plants grown on Earth. On Earth, mechanical signaling systems are known to affect plant vigor, alter their growth habit (favoring plants that are smaller and more robust), and also impact on plant defense responses to pathogens. Therefore, this work aimed at analysis of how Ca2+ signaling is involved in the altered mechanical responses induced during spaceflight should also reveal the role for this system in the more general mechanically-linked responses of plants on Earth. Importantly, this research will allow analysis of the effects of the plant's own weight on its growth and development, research only possible in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. These results should provide molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant growth to varied mechanical environments, especially the relatively mechanically silent environments of spaceflight and controlled enclosed environments on Earth, such as greenhouses.\nThis experiment has also been supplemented with a parallel geneLAB experiment to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. The responses of these variants (ecotypes) to spaceflight will not only help further define how the altered environment of space can differentially affect even closely related varieties of plants, but also help provide important background data for the design of future spaceflight experimentation using different ecotypes of this widely adopted model plant."

            "task_progress": "This research has used the BRIC-PDFU hardware to address how the altered mechanical environment of spaceflight affects plant growth and gene expression. The research uses mutants in the core touch-response gene CALMODULIN-LIKE 24 (CML24) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and focuses on the Ca2+-dependent signaling network that operates in response to touch stimulation of plants. Both wild type and mutants in CML24 were grown on the International Space Station (ISS), chemically fixed, and then frozen on orbit and then their patterns of gene expression and growth habit compared to parallel ground controls once the samples were returned to Earth.\nThe overall experimental design was to grow seedlings of wild type, cml24-2, and cml24-4 on orbit using the BRIC-PDFU hardware, preserve the seedlings after 8 days using chemical fixation in RNAlater, and freezing in the MELFI. cml24-2 and cml24-4 are two different mutants in the CML24 gene that are thought to continuously activate or inactivate the gene respectively. Upon sample return, whole genome gene expression patterns were assessed using RNAseq to define whether the spaceflight samples showed a transcriptional \"fingerprint\" of altered mechanical responsiveness, or of other changes in signaling and response networks relative to parallel samples grown under identical conditions on the ground.\nThis experiment was also supplemented with a parallel GeneLab study to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. Arabidopsis grows across the planet and subpopulations (ecotypes) show slightly different characteristics dependent on where they originate from. The ecotypes used in the experiment were chosen to span the range of likely ecotypes to be used in future spaceflight experimentation. This approach provides key baseline comparisons to help understand the impact of ecotypic makeup on responses to spaceflight and so provide important background data for the design of future spaceflight experimentation using this widely adopted model plant.\nPreflight testing (Science and Payload Verification Tests) was successfully completed in 2014 and the payload of 4 BRIC canisters containing a total of twenty 60 mm Petri dishes, each containing 64 seeds, was launched on board SpaceX-CRS4. All on orbit operations were successfully completed and the frozen samples were returned via SpaceX's Dragon capsule, transported to Kennedy Space Center, de-integrated and shipped to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where RNA was successfully extracted and RNAseq transcriptome analysis performed. Six to eight replicate samples were isolated per type of plant. All samples were in the “excellent” range for all mission success criteria.\nRNAseq was used to monitor the levels of all genes in each sample. To robustly define the up- and down-regulated genes, we used the Tuxedo RNAseq computer analysis pipeline and then applied three separate normalization methods that apply different approaches to statistically assign significantly differentially expressed genes: DESeq, EdgeR, and CuffDiff2. Agreement between multiple analysis approaches provides increased confidence that they are faithfully extracting genes showing true changes in activity in the spaceflight samples. Additionally, we used strict 95% statistical significance cutoffs and false discovery rates to maintain stringent selection criteria, and further maximized confidence by looking for where all 3 of the three normalization approaches agreed that a gene was differentially expressed. By these criteria 1556 genes were significantly altered in the cml24 mutant backgrounds with an enrichment in heat shock proteins, that may represent an enhancement of a core spaceflight response system. In addition to alterations in mechanically-responsive genes, flight transcriptomes were seen to parallel those of plants on Earth that have been challenged with the pathogen defense elicitor molecules. Thus, there is significant overlap between the spaceflight and defense elicitor gene sets with, e.g., 19% of the genes altered in flight being associated with bacterial defense response on Earth. As the flight samples were maintained under strict sterile conditions and showed no bacterial or fungal contamination, these results suggest alteration in defense signaling may be one element of the spaceflight response in plants. A further finding from this analysis is that up- and down-regulated flight genes seen in wild-type plants are often even more significantly altered in the cml24-4 mutant (the loss of function mutant in the CML24 gene) and this response can be reversed in the cml24-2 mutant that shows irreversible activation on the CML24 gene. Overall what emerges from these analyses is a significant enrichment in defense- and mechanically-responsive genes in the spaceflight environment.\nParallel analysis of the multiple ecotypes flown under the Genelab component of this experiment indicated genes encoding heat shock proteins are up-regulated in response to spaceflight. Heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones that act in many stress response pathways in addition to temperature stress. At a cellular level, these proteins act to refold or remove other proteins damaged by environmental conditions and have been highlighted in previous spaceflight responses of Arabidopsis cell cultures. Further analysis indicates other related molecular chaperones that change in some, but not all, of the ecotypes, further emphasizing the link between chaperones and response to spaceflight. Importantly, data logger information from BRIC-19 showed that no thermal excursions from the ISS ambient of ~24°C occurred during the experiment indicating these transcripts are not simply reporting a heat shock event but suggesting upregulation of a broad stress-related machinery in response to some other aspect of the spaceflight environment. Spaceflight also led to down-regulation of classes of genes and prominent amongst these were enzymes of the peroxidase family that are involved in remodeling the plant cell wall. A role for these enzymes in spaceflight was previously highlighted in results from the BRIC16 experiment, suggesting alteration in cell wall structure may be a commonly occurring plant response to the spaceflight environment.\nGene ontology/classification analyses of these data further suggest response to oxidative stress is a major component of the core spaceflight stress network, a conclusion supported by gene network analysis, such as with the QTLNetminer tool. The raw gene expression data for these analyses has been deposited as GeneLab Data System-37.\nIn collaboration with Dr. Richard Morris at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK, work has also been conducted on modeling how reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ interact to propagate stress responses in plants. Using a combination of in vivo imaging of Ca2+ and ROS dynamics and analysis of responses in the AtRBOHD mutant (defective in the Respiratory Burst Homolog D enzyme responsible for producing many signaling-related changes in ROS), the role of this enzyme in ROS-assisted Ca2+-dependent stress signaling has been dissected. This quantitative analysis allowed Richard Morris to develop a math-based model to describe this phenomenon. The model predicts a role for AtRBOHD-dependent extracellular ROS production in cell-to-cell movement of stress information within the plant. Using measurements of responses to inhibitors of AtRBOHD, mutants, and quantitative imaging, the predictions of the model have been tested and the model validated.",

            "task_description": "The shaping of plant architecture is a process that unfolds over the entire lifespan of a plant and is continually informed by developmental and environmental cues. On Earth, the most pervasive and constant of these environmental cues is gravity. Gravity is an important factor in guiding how plant organs are organized in space. However, gravity does not only provide directional information during plant development. As growing plants gain size and mass, the increasing weight of vertical stems and laterally projecting branches and leaves results in progressive mechanical self-loading. These mechanical loads can lead to buckling or breaking of plant organs unless they are structurally reinforced.\nThe principal objective of this research proposal is to understand how mechanical loads are translated into developmental programs that maintain structural integrity of the plant body. Specifically, we will investigate the role of the plasma membrane receptor-like kinase FERONIA in this process, as we have recently discovered that FERONIA is crucial to normal mechanical signaling and mechanical development of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse Ear Cress). We will employ fluorescence microscopy, growth kinematics, and molecular biology approaches to investigate how FERONIA interacts with gravity and other mechanical signal transduction pathways.\nResults from such analyses are responsive to the goals of the NASA Research Announcement in addressing the fundamental question of how plants sense and react to gravity as a mechanical force to regulate growth and development. Understanding how FERONIA serves to help plants adapt under conditions of non-Earth-normal gravity may eventually provide a means for modulating mechanical strength in plants raised in microgravity conditions in the absence of mechanical self-load.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research addresses the question of how plants sense mechanical forces and how they utilize this information to modulate growth and tissue strength. Understanding how mechanical signaling, and specifically mechanical signaling through the receptor-like kinase FERONIA, affects the growth and development of plants will not only provide insight into how the reduced gravity environment of spaceflight will affect plant architecture, but will also have translational potential for improving plant agriculture on Earth. Understanding the mechanisms that enhance plant tissue strength may eventually yield molecular targets for the manipulation of traits that allow plants to withstand wind and to penetrate compacted soils."

            "task_progress": "The receptor-like kinase FERONIA is activated by binding its small secreted peptide ligand RALF1 (RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR1) but is also essential to mechanical signal transduction. To understand the role of FERONIA in mechanical signal transduction we have analyzed (1)  the effect of RALF1 on mechanosensitivity of Arabidopsis roots; (2) the effects of RALF1 and mechanical wounding on FERONIA subcellular localization; (3) mechanisms underlying FERONIA-dependent Ca2+ signaling. We have found that pretreatment with RALF1 peptides rapidly desensitizes FER-dependent mechanical Ca2+ signaling. We further observed that RALF1 triggers endocytosis and degradation of FERONIA via the endosomal pathway. In contrast, mechanical wounding also appears to elicit a loss of FERONIA from the plasma membrane, but via a different pathway. Finally, we found that FERONIA-dependent mechanical Ca2+ signaling requires the expression of a subset of CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNELS; the same channels are not essential for FERONIA-dependent RALF1-induced Ca2+ signaling. These results suggests that FERONIA may act as a dual function receptor or as a hub where RALF1 and mechanical signaling pathways (among others) are integrated.\nTo understand the role of FERONIA in regulating cell expansion, we have (1) assayed rapid growth responses to RALF1 using high-resolution kinematic analysis ; (2) analyzed FER-dependent changes in vacuolar morphology and cytoskeletal organization. We found that RALF1 triggers rapid growth inhibition in Arabidopsis roots in a FERONIA- and Ca2+ dependent manner. RALF1-induced growth inhibition is correlated with a reduction in cell extensibility as assayed  in osmotic inflation experiments. Osmotic inflation assays also indicate differences in wild type and feronia loss-of-function mutant cell extensibility. We further observed that RALF1 treatment triggers a rapid (within 10 minutes) change in vacuolar morphology that is associated with a concomitant change in actin cytoskeleton organization. These results are consistent with FERONIA signaling affeccting both cell wall extensibility and cell turgor to modulate growth.",

Several defined locations were systematically collected from 3 consecutive flights and microbial census was generated using advanced molecular microbial community analysis “omics” techniques, supported by traditional culture-based methods. Similarly, an Inflated Lunar/Mars Analog Habitat as a ground control system and SpaceX CRS (Commercial Resupply Service) vehicles to trace source of any possible contamination were examined and results presented.

The safety of crewmembers and the maintenance of hardware are the primary goals for monitoring microorganisms in this closed habitat.\nThis study provides the first comprehensive catalogue of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.

This is a critical concern, since a) the immune system of the crew is dysfunctional during spaceflight, b) spaceflight uniquely increases the virulence and globally alters gene expression of the human pathogen Salmonella typhimurium when the bacteria are recovered post-flight and subsequently used to infect ground-based animal models, c) spaceflight-induced increases in S. typhimurium virulence are regulated by media ion composition, d) phosphate ion is sufficient to alter related pathogenesis responses in a ground-based spaceflight analogue model, and e) the evolutionarily conserved bacterial RNA chaperone protein, Hfq, serves as a master molecular regulator of many of these responses. While spaceflight has been shown to induce changes that can independently affect the host or the pathogen in a manner that is directly relevant to the development of infectious disease during spaceflight, none of these studies have been done when both the host and pathogen are simultaneously exposed to the spaceflight environment. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to challenge the human surrogate model Caenorhabditis elegans with S. typhimurium during spaceflight to study the role of the intestine in host-pathogen interactions in real-time, define virulence mechanisms, identify evolutionarily conserved responses, and test novel therapeutic strategies to prevent infectious disease. We hypothesize that the combination of a spaceflight-induced increase in virulence of the pathogen coupled with a blunted immune response of the host will result in a synergistic effect on the host-pathogen interaction such that the risk of infectious disease during spaceflight is exacerbated. We further propose that these responses represent evolutionarily conserved mechanisms at the level of both host and pathogen that are dependent on media ion composition, specifically the local concentration of phosphate.\nSee also:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/Micro-5.html\nNOTE (6/9/2017): Project continues as \"Investigation of Host-Pathogen Interactions, Conserved Cellular Responses, and Countermeasure Efficacy During Spaceflight using the Human Surrogate Model Caenorhabditis elegans--NNX17AJ53G,\" with the same Principal Investigator, Dr. Cheryl Nickerson.",

            "task_description": "This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.\nIn a corollary set of experiments, we are utilizing next generation sequencing techniques to assess the effects of long term exposure to radiation on the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in a variety of model systems. The most comprehensive view of this process has come from yeast which, owing to the conservation of this essential pathway, shares homologs of their human DNA repair counterparts. A key observation from our group and others is that different types of DNA damage require unique repair genes and proteins. Accordingly,  we are studying the cellular response to energetic particle radiation experienced in space using whole genome sequencing of thousands of yeast cells exposed to a large matrix of space-specific conditions.\nWe hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.\nThe proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station (ISS); (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data; (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.\nTo test our hypothesis, we will:\n1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated microgravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.\n2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated microgravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme that is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.\n3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground-based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This work aims to understand the genetic control mechanism that controls the gene expression response to cellular responses to microgravity in yeast.\nYeast have 70% homolog with the human genome, and are a useful model system to define primary and secondary drug metabolism pathways that cannot be done in current mammalian cell culture systems.\nThe short term aim is to map the genetic promoter elements that mediate gene responses to microgravity. The long term goal is to use this information to unveil drug metabolism pathways in the unique metabolic environment provided by microgravity.\nWe propose to establish a sustained genomics platform on the ISS to understand the long term effects of the radiation, and other features of the ISS environment, on crew health by dissecting the essential processes of DNA damage and DNA repair. This has broad Earth benefits in understanding effects and optimization of medically necessary radiation therapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents.\nThe APEX-02-2 work  quantitatively measures radiation damage to yeast DNA exposed to space radiation. Using state of the art technologies, the science team can, for the first time, conduct a highly powered, genome wide analysis of mechanisms of radiation damage in space. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating space based radiation damage.\nBy using yeast strains to understand the effects of space based radiation stresses at the cellular level, a greater knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms at work in cells will be gained. A hallmark of radiation stresses is that they induce physiological responses; primary among them are DNA damage. As yeast is a model eukaryotic organism, DNA damage changes caused by radiation could lead to a greater understanding of these processes on Earth, thus benefiting all citizens. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating clinical radiation damage.\nYeast deletion project is a project to create data for a near-complete collection of gene-deletion mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each strain carries a precise deletion of one of the genes in the genome, and has been functionally characterized. We have now cloned the 6,000+ strains of the yeast deletion series into the background of 10 separate deletion clones of genes known to play a major role in responses to radiation damage."

The final Cytoscope/Cluego visualization and probability modeling are ongoing.\nThe resources provided have allowed us to address the unifying hypothesis in a sophisticated and nuanced manner, with some important caveats for countermeasures. Our hypothesis is that cells cope with the stress associated with the microgravity of space environment by selectively changing the expression of specific target genes and this response is mediated by defined transcription factors. We have been able to determine specific target genes and mechanistic pathways determining them, including transcription factors, in a variety of space based models using background deletion of several radiation protection genes, as well as stimulation of the system with multiple drugs. In particular, we can now address whether metformin, a drug originally utilized in diabetes, but shown to have cancer protective properties, may be a useful radiation countermeasure. In this manner, the work directly addresses multiple Space Biology Science Plan's research goals, objectives, and guiding questions.\nAll OMICS data will be annotated and deposited in the NASA GeneLab portal.",

            "task_description": "The study was designed to determine effects of extended space travel on oral tissues using the salivary glands of mice. Rodent salivary glands are structurally and functionally similar to those of humans therefore useful for research on changes associated with travel in space. Salivary glands and oral fluid play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the mouth and teeth. Proteins present in secretion granules of salivary glands are released into saliva and can be used to monitor effects of environmental stress. Salivary proteins can serve as markers for physiologic processes such as digestive and immune systems and hormonal regulation. The proteins in saliva are reliable indicators of the environmental effects of travel in space.  The physiologic processes for which they are markers are either slowed, accelerated or unaffected.  Several of the proteins have previously been shown to respond to a variety of environmental stimuli, including space flight. Our previous studies on short duration (~ 1 week) space flight missions showed that specific secretory proteins were modified by exposure to both zero (ØG) and hyper G conditions. Proteins associated with hormonal signaling and gene expression are down-regulated.  An enzyme that is associated with digestion seems unaffected while some cellular proteins appear increased. Employing saliva as a diagnostic test medium could have clinical applications and be useful in measuring human responses to space flight.  The present results agree with previous findings that proteins in salivary glands are specifically altered during space flight and can therefore be used as markers for environmental effects on different physiological  and behavioral responses.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Background and Objectives:   It is important to study the effects of travel in space and to measure reactions to the stress of weightlessness in zero gravity (ØG) conditions. Stress changes hormone action that is reflected in glands that produce saliva as well as in different body parts/organs. The goal is to devise a clinical test for stress disorders in space and on Earth. Saliva contains substances (e.g. proteins) that change during travel in space. We can determine which salivary proteins have been changed by using biochemical tests and histologic analyses to study tissues and cells (salivary glands) that produce saliva in mice flown on the space shuttle Discovery STS-131, 133, and 135 missions. This information will be used to design a test kit to measure responses in astronauts so no blood will have to be drawn. Collecting saliva instead of blood and urine, will be easier during space flight and will make it possible to study hormone changes experienced by Astronauts and Cosmonauts at ØG. Travel in space is an ideal model system for studying a specific environmental impact on physiologic function that is due to gravitational change and cannot be duplicated on Earth. Understanding the effect of ØG will define changes due to the environment as the stressor. This information can then be adapted to devising specific tests of different conditions using saliva for general clinical applications in medicine in space or on Earth.\nResearch Description:   The Biospecimen Sharing Program has provided an unparalleled opportunity to study tissue and secretory protein signaling in tissues affected by environmental stimuli whereby cellular and molecular changes associated with travel in space can be identified in experimental animals and can be monitored by measuring the expression of specific proteins. Previous studies on the effects of space flight have shown that regulation by catecholamine hormones is markedly altered during space flight. The expression of specific proteins as markers can potentially be used for measuring responses to environmental stress since changes in the expression of secretory proteins are reflected in saliva."

            "task_description": "The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e., primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g., mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on Earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA (NASA Research Announcement) because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research will provide a deeper understanding of how microgravity influences plant development. The focus of this research will be on the development of roots and how they modify the expression of their genes to adapt to the microgravity environment of spaceflight.\nThis research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of their cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature to overcome the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth."

            "task_progress": "We achieved all of the major milestones we set for this proposal. Malfunction of the ABRS hardware on the ISS, de-manifestation from Space X-3, and delays in the launch of Space X-5 were set-backs we encountered during the first two years of the grant. However, we were able to overcome these early problems and completed most of the specific aims that we proposed. A major accomplishment of this proposal was the implementation of a simple method to delay germination of Arabidopsis seeds until experimental activation in space. We foresee that many in the plant space biology community will benefit from these methods. Another direct outcome of this grant is the discovery of novel plant proteins involved in modulating the cytoskeleton. These results have been published in high impact peer-reviewed publications.\nWe also successfully retrieved material from ground- and space-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. Processing and data analysis from these spaceflight experiments have been completed. We have deposited raw RNA-Seq data from our spaceflight work to the NASA GeneLab site but these have not yet been publicly released. During this funding period, we also completed glycomic studies of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in space and compared them with the corresponding ground controls. Both the transcriptomics (i.e., RNA-Seq) and glycomics results will be submitted this year for peer-review.\nTaken together, our RNA-Seq and glycomics results continue to point to the spaceflight environment as a major trigger for oxidative stress responses in plants. Our results suggest that the ideal plant ideotype for future space habitats could be similar to those that have been developed for marginal agricultural lands on Earth including crops tolerant to low oxygen (e.g., hypoxia) and other stressors (drought, insect resistance) as well as those with more robust cell wall mechanical properties. Such findings could be the bases of future spaceflight experiments wherein performance of plants with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress can be evaluated on hardware such as the advanced plant habitat (APH) or the Spectrum.",

            "task_description": "Background: Maintaining astronaut health during long-term space flight is of prime importance to the success of exploration missions to destinations such as the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars. The immune system weakens during missions in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), rendering astronauts more susceptible to infection. Microgravity induces in certain bacterial species increased virulence properties such as: adherence to mammalian cells, biofilm formation, resistance to acid and macrophages, and antibiotic resistance. As part of the normal population of microbial inhabitants on and within the human body, astronauts carry many microbes considered “opportunistic pathogens”, i.e., normally harmless microbes with the potential to cause disease in hosts with lowered immune function. Opportunistic infections are often treated with combinations of two antibiotics that differ in their mechanisms of action. Combination treatment can be effective because (i) certain antibiotic combinations work synergistically to more effectively combat the pathogen than either drug given alone, and (ii) the probability of the pathogen evolving resistance to two antibiotics simultaneously is much lower than that of becoming resistant to a single antibiotic.\nRationale: Susceptibility of potential pathogens to single antibiotics in the space flight environment has been studied to a limited extent, but a systematic study of the development of multiple antibiotic resistance by mutation has not to date been attempted. In a previous space exposure experiment (PROTECT on International Space Station-ISS using the bacterium Bacillus subtilis), we found that certain mutations to rifampicin (RIF) resistance also resulted in resistance to trimethoprim (TMP). RIF and TMP are prescribed in combination for treatment of certain infections caused by the important opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.\nGoal: We propose to test the hypothesis that exposure to the human space flight environment, particularly microgravity, increases the development of simultaneous resistance to RIF and TMP. As our test organisms we will use the reference B. subtilis strain 168 and Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC 12228, a harmless human commensal organism closely related to S. aureus.\nCentral Objectives:\n1. Measure mutation rates of B. subtilis and S. epidermidis to RIF and TMP resistance, singly and in combination, in space flight and ground control samples.\n2. Recover antibiotic-resistant mutants and determine the nucleotide sequence changes in the rpoB and dfrA genes leading to resistance to RIF and TMP, respectively.\n3. Characterize altered phenotypes of the mutants obtained in Objectives (1) and (2).\nMethods: Preliminary ground-based studies will be performed using rotating High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs) to simulate microgravity. Space flight experiments will be performed using the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) developed for use on the International Space Station with asynchronous ground controls. HARVs, BRIC-PDFUs, and support personnel are conveniently located at the Space Life Sciences Lab, Kennedy Space Center. All microbiology and molecular biology techniques proposed are routinely performed in our laboratory.\nSignificance: The proposed study responds to the National Research Council's (NRC’s) 2011 Decadal Report Recommendation P2, to: “Establish a robust space flight program of research analyzing plant and microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments,” and directly relates to section C2 of the present NASA Research Announcement (NRA)-“Rapid Turnaround Space Flight Experiments,” specifically addressing the question “What are the genetic changes associated with responses to space flight in biological systems?” Understanding multidrug resistance in opportunistic pathogens during long-term human space flight directly benefits astronaut health and the success of extended missions both in LEO and in interplanetary space.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "In several ways, astronauts on long-duration space flights share commonalities with patients in long-term clinical care settings: Both groups are relatively immobile, immunocompromised, share close living quarters with others in a similar weakened physiologic condition, and are susceptible to opportunistic infections. Understanding how multiple antibiotic resistance arises in opportunistic human pathogens during space flight can be directly translated to Earth-based medicine."

            "task_progress": "Final Progress Report, NASA grant NNX12AN70G:\n“Development of multiple antibiotic resistance by opportunistic bacterial pathogens during human space flight”\nYear 1:\n1. Preparation for BRIC-18 mission to ISS.   In Year 1 we took considerable effort to prepare for the Dragon III mission to ISS. With the help of NASA and the BRIC payload development team we successfully passed SVT and proceeded to PVT (now known as Experiment Verification Testing, or EVT)\n2. Ground simulation studies.   Using Synthecon Rotary Cell Culture Systems, we performed experiments to test the hypothesis that exposure of bacterial cells to simulated microgravity increases the frequency of spontaneous mutations to antibiotic resistance. We used two clinostats each equipped with  four 10-ml High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs), one placed in the Vertical (V) position to simulate microgravity and one placed in the Horizontal (H) position as a 1xg control. We showed that B. subtilis and S. epidermidis cells grew at equal exponential rates in the V and H positions, but in cell viability decline in stationary phase was significantly slower in the V orientation.\nAfter 6 days of cultivation, B. subtilis cells exhibited a significantly higher frequency of mutation to rifampicin (RFM) resistance in the V orientation. This observation supports our Central Hypothesis. A variable percentage of RFM mutants also become resistant to trimethoprim (TMP).We initiated the same studies above using S. epidermidis, but suffered a slight setback when we discovered that the gas exchange membranes in four of our HARVs had developed pinhole leaks. These HARVs were returned to Synthecon for repair and returned in good condition\n3. Acquisition and training of NASA-SAIP undergraduate intern Raed Narvel.   Through a competitive selection procedure, we attracted Raed Narvel to participate in this project. Raed, a senior undergraduate Microbiology & Cell Science major at University of Florida (UF), was awarded a 10-week summer internship from the NASA-Florida Space Grant Consortium Space Aeronautics Internship Program. Raed proved to be a very bright intern and his efforts were instrumental in successfully completing the ground-based clinostat studies.\nYear 2:\n1. Conclusion of pre-flight Ground Simulation studies.  \tUsing Synthecon Rotary Cell Culture Systems, we performed experiments to test the hypothesis that exposure of bacterial cells to simulated microgravity increases the frequency of spontaneous mutations to antibiotic resistance. We used two clinostats each equipped with  four 10-ml High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs), one placed in the Vertical (V) position to simulate microgravity and one placed in the Horizontal (H) position as a 1xg control. We showed that both Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis cells grew at equal exponential rates in the V and H positions, but that cell viability decline in stationary phase was significantly slower in the V orientation in both organisms.   \tAfter 6 days of cultivation, B. subtilis cells exhibited a significantly higher frequency of mutation to rifampicin (RFM) resistance in the V orientation, supporting the Central Hypothesis. A variable percentage of RFM mutants also become resistant to trimethoprim (TMP). However, S. epidermidis cells demonstrated an equivalent frequency of mutation to RFMR in either the H or V orientation, failing to support the Central Hypothesis. Thus, the two model organisms behaved differently under ground-based microgravity simulations.\n2. Preparation and launch of BRIC-18 mission to ISS.   Our experiments passed Science Verification testing (SVT) and Payload Verification Testing (PVT) and all NASA Flight Readiness Reviews. Various issues led to repeated delays of the launch of BRIC-18 to ISS. Finally, BRIC canisters were integrated and successfully launched on the SpaceX 3rd cargo delivery mission to the ISS on April 18, 2014.\nYear 3:\nObjective 1. Publication of pre-flight Ground Simulation studies.   \tWe published our pre-flight ground simulation studies in the journal Gravitational and Space Research 2(2): 34-45. 2014. Below is reprinted the Abstract:  \tBacteria of the genera Bacillus and Staphylococcus are frequent inhabitants of the International Space Station (ISS) and represent possible opportunistic pathogens. The effect of simulated microgravity on growth and the frequency of mutation to antibiotic resistance in the model surrogate organisms Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) were investigated. The test organisms were cultivated for six days in Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) clinostats either in the vertical (simulated microgravity) or horizontal (1 g control) orientation. Parameters measured were: optical densities (ODs); viable counts; frequencies of resistance to rifampicin (RFM); and frequencies of double resistance to RFM and trimethoprim (TMP). The results indicated that the response to simulated microgravity differed in the two microorganisms. Both B. subtilis and S. epidermidis grew to higher ODs and cell numbers in simulated microgravity. However, the frequencies of mutation, both to RFM resistance and double resistance to RFM and TMP, were observed to increase significantly in simulated microgravity-grown B. subtilis but not in S. epidermidis.\nObjective 2. Launch to and recovery of BRIC-18 Flight (FL) samples from ISS. Performance of asynchronous Ground Control (GC) experiment and recovery of GC samples.   \tFlight and Ground Controls. The BRIC-18 hardware payload was launched on the third SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the ISS (SpaceX-3) on 18 April 2014, using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. The Dragon capsule docked with the ISS on 21 April 2014, then BRIC-A and BRIC-B canisters were transferred to the ISS on 22 April 2014 and stowed in the US laboratory module. Actuation of both canisters (i.e., injection of growth medium) was performed on 30 April 2014 at 10:08 EDT and samples were incubated at ISS ambient temperature until 5 May 2014 at 12:04 PM EDT, resulting in a total incubation time of 122 h. The experiment was terminated by transfer into the onboard -80°C MELFI freezer. The Dragon capsule returned to Earth on 18 May 2014 and samples were maintained in the frozen state until return to KSC for de-integration and further processing. Asynchronous GC experiments were performed in BRIC canisters in the ISS Experiment Simulation (ISSES) chamber at KSC according to the timeline and temperature profile recorded during the FL experiment. Following incubation, samples were transferred to a -80°C freezer and stored until further processing.\nPost-experiment sample processing. BRIC canisters were moved from storage at -80°C to a 4°C refrigerator and allowed to thaw overnight. Petri dishes were removed from PDFUs, cells resuspended using sterile disposable rubber spatulas, cultures transferred to sterile 50-mL conical centrifuge tubes, and the total volume recovered was measured. For viable counts, cultures were diluted serially tenfold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours. To select for RFMR mutants, cultures were concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY+RFM plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours. The frequency of mutation to RFMR was calculated by dividing the total number of RFMR mutants by the total number of viable cells from each culture. Individual RFMR mutants were streak-purified and processed for further characterization by DNA sequencing.\nDNA sequencing and analyses. RFMR region of the B. subtilis and S. epidermidis rpoB genes were PCR amplified directly from cells and their nucleotide sequences determined at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology (UF-ICBR). The rpoB sequences from FL and GC samples were aligned with the wild-type rpoB sequence using the online Clustal Omega server (\nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/\n) to identify the position of mutations relative to the sequences of the wild-type rpoB sequences obtained in parallel from B. subtilis strain WN1532 and S. epidermidis ATCC12228. This sequencing project is ongoing. We obtained a total of 330 RFMR mutants from both organisms and to date have sequenced 142 of them. The complete set of FL and GC results will be reported upon and published within the next year.\nObjective 3. Characterize altered phenotypes of the mutants obtained in Objectives (1) and (2). We have just recently begun to make progress on this objective during Summer of 2015. New graduate student Michael Morrison has calibrated the Omnilog Phenotype Microarray instrument to quantify the pattern of susceptibility of B. subtilis and S. epidermidis to a battery of 72 different antibiotics and growth-suppressing compounds, each delivered at 4 different concentrations.  Results will be reported and published within the next year.",

            "task_description": "Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.\nPlants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development, and reduces yield.\nIn animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).\nIn all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast (8-10) and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.\nWe believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.\nWe also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.\nWe also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.\nIn conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.\nREFERENCES\n1.

These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to a variety of plant cellular stress responses. We successfully completed both of the preflight tests (science verification test (SVT) and experiment verification test (EVT)) to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the plant samples returned from BRIC-22. On August 14, 2017 our experiment was launched on board the SpaceX-12 ISS resupply mission and was successfully executed by ISS astronauts. The samples were preserved on orbit and underwent atmospheric reentry on board the same Dragon capsule in September of 2017. At the same time a duplicate of the experiment was grown at the Kennedy Space Center using temperature conditions which were matched to the flight conditions. We extracted RNA from both sets of samples and performed RNA sequencing in order to better understand what genes would be turned on and off specifically by spaceflight conditions in wild type plants and our mutant plants. We observed changes in the way that thousands of genes were activated in response to these conditions between flight and ground conditions and are submitting our results for peer review.\nMeanwhile, further research on these stress regulating genes and the Arabidopsis mutants that were tested in BRIC-22 is also being completed in continuing ground-based studies. Through a better understanding of these gene’s function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses.",

            "task_description": "Published data demonstrates that short term microgravity (µG) (~2 wks) produces small but significant reductions in spermatogenesis in rats. However, long term ground-based µG models using the rodent hindlimb unloading (HLS) (> 3 wks), with surgical prevention of cryptorchidism, show dramatic testicular atrophy and loss of spermatogenesis leading to sterility. These results and related literature in humans suggest that longer duration space flight may have negative impacts on spermatogenesis and compromise male health and increase cancer risk. Thus, the testable hypothesis driving this proposal is: Exposure to µG 3 wks or longer causes disruption of spermatogenesis in mice. This proposal addresses the Bioastronautic Roadmap (BR) Risk 30: Chronic and Degenerative Tissue Risks in that long term µG-induced testicular atrophy will increase the risk for long term health problems post-flight including increased cancer risk and sterility. The hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims: 1. Identify specific histopathology and dysfunction in spermatogenesis and testis function in mice exposed to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for 30 d (as determined by mission duration) and compare to ground-based controls. 2. Quantify declines in sperm motility and morphology in cauda epididymal sperm from male mice exposed to LEO for 30 d (as determined by mission duration) and compare to ground-based controls. 3. Determine dysregulation in gene transcription of markers of spermatogenic regulation and inflammatory markers in testes from mice exposed to LEO for 30 d (as determined by mission duration) and compare to ground-based controls. 4. Determine declines in fertility and fecundity of male mice exposed to µG (This aim will depend upon availability of flight animals for mating trials). The opportunity to expose male mice for 30 d of µG in the new BION flights represents the first to directly evaluate this reproductive health problem directly in long term µG under properly controlled conditions. These experiments will validate the ground-based long term HLS rodent model and provide proof that male reproductive health is put at risk by extended exposure to µG. The experiments will provide an initial data set for development of appropriate countermeasures to the negative impact of long term space flight on endocrine and reproductive physiology compromising male health.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Female reproductive studies:\nThe observed down-regulation of estrogen receptor  ERa, combined with the histological changes, suggests that the animals stopped cycling in space flight and estrogen support was severely impaired. The observations are also significant in that the results were verified on three separate Space Shuttle experiments (STS-131, STS-133, and STS-135). If ERa is also down regulated in other tissues, this would indicate a common mechanism underlying space-flight induced degradation of other estrogen dependent systems including bone loss, muscle weakness, immune response, and wound repair.\nA broad effect of space flight on ERa receptor levels and/or signaling will offer a common pathway to generate countermeasures for space flight. Since similar changes occur in the same organ systems during the aging process, the countermeasures would have application for improving quality of life in the same organ systems during the aging process.\nMale reproductive health:\nThe experiments outlined in this proposal will be the first to determine directly, under controlled space flight conditions, whether exposure to long duration microgravity (µG) disrupts sperm production and compromises male reproductive health in mammals. The unique opportunities offered in the new BION 30 d+ rodent flights are the first to extend space flight beyond all previous µG exposures for rodent models on any flight platform. As such, the planned experiments will be the first to directly assess a long term health risk that has been identified by ground-based space flight animal and human models. Thus the hypothesis driving the research: that long term space flight has negative impacts on male reproductive health.\nSpecific Aim 1. Identify specific histopathology and dysfunction in spermatogenesis and testis function in mice exposed to LEO for 30 d (as determined by mission duration) and compare to ground-based controls.\nSpecific Aim 2. Quantify declines in sperm motility and morphology in cauda epididymal sperm from male mice exposed to LEO for 30 d (as determined by mission duration) and compare to ground-based controls.\nSpecific Aim 3. Determine dysregulation in gene transcription of markers of spermatogenic regulation and inflammatory markers in testes from mice exposed to LEO for 30 d (as determined by mission duration) and compare to ground-based controls.\nSpace flight impacts on reproductive health include both microgravity and radiation environmental factors.  Space flight changes are an excellent accelerated analogue to the aging process on Earth.  The 30 day BION M1 mission will combine the longest exposure and the largest number of mice in a single mission and represent a significant duration relative to the complete spermatogenesis cycle in the testis. Changes in sperm motility, spermatogenesis, gene transcription, and DNA damage in long term space flight will offer the first comparison for identical male reproductive health outcome measures for the normal aging process on Earth."

            "task_progress": "The BION M1 flight was the first opportunity to directly test the hypothesis that prolonged space flight negatively affects testicular function and spermatogenesis. Seven mature male mice were flown in orbit for 30 d. Asynchronous diet and age-matched ground control (GC) mice were maintained in the same BION hardware on the ground for 30 d. For histology, testis and epididymis were fixed in Bouin’s solution, washed in 70% ETOH, paraffin-embedded, and processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining. For RNA and protein extraction tissues were harvested in RNAlater and stored at -80°C. RNA was subjected to real-time RT PCR. Next Generation sequencing was used to compare gene expression profiles between flight and GC mouse testes. We report preliminary results from analysis of a subset of flight and GC animals for histological modifications, and testicular/spermatogenesis gene expression changes. Remarkably, only 43 genes showed significant changes (q = .05) of 14,360 expressed genes in flight, and 14374 genes in GC (FPKM>1). This represents a remarkably low 0.3% of the entire genome. Thus, the space flight effect in testis is very focused to a small subset of the genome. In the flight group, elevated expression of testicular and epididymis-specific genes included LCN8 (lipocalin 8) and Defb41, involved in testicular exocrine secretion; Cst11 (cystatin11), responded for gonadal development; Cldn2 (claudin 2) relevant to the blood-testes and blood-epididymal barrier; RNase10, required for post-testicular sperm maturation and male fertility. Significantly down-regulated genes included FABP4- fatty acid binding protein 4, androgen-dependent CFD-complement factor D, Car3, carbonic anhydrase 3, inflammatory marker IL-12. Quantitative RT PCR confirmed dramatic down-regulation of FABP4 (over 20 fold), CFD (5- fold), and Car3 (2-fold) in the flight group testis. Testis estrogen receptor-alpha expression was also reduced by µG exposure (P<0.05). We confirmed a 4-fold increased Defb41 in flight vs GC. Differentially expressed genes involved in several canonical pathways included immune responses, metabolic, and endocrine functions.\nThe mice were sexually mature at launch, so that any observed changes can be attributed to space-flight induced changes in mature testis function and not alterations in a) ongoing maturation of post-natal or b) pre-pubertal testis development, or c) continuing sexual maturation. As such, these animals would be a rodent analogue to adult male astronauts. The RNA quality used from the replicate mice testes from all groups was in excellent condition with no evidence of degradation. The effect of space flight was limited to an extremely small subset of the entire expressed genome with, using high stringency, significant changes in gene expression of only 43 genes out of ~14,370 detected genes. This represents a remarkable 0.3% of the entire genome. This means that the space flight effect is very focused to a small subset of genes in the testis. The strength in this finding is that any pathways identified have a high likelihood of being directly related to space flight effects. This is a valid conclusion since the animals in both flight and BION hardware ground control groups were no different, and unremarkable with respect to body weight (nutrition) and health post-flight. This conclusion is supported by the fact that they were also not significantly different by the same parameters from the parallel vivarium controls that were used as an internal reference standards since the flight and ground control BION groups were asynchronous.\nKey observations and their significance (expanded preliminary data analysis): There is a remarkably and highly significant “hot” cluster of interacting physiologic pathways involved in immune regulation. With respect to male reproductive health, this finding is significant since the testis is normally an immunologically privileged site. This immune privilege is maintained by the blood-testis barrier (BTB). The BTB is very similar to the blood-brain barrier in both structure and function. In normal testis, the inflammatory/immune response genes are critical for maintenance of spermatogenesis. The finding shows that space flight significantly affects these pathways. Two preliminary conclusions can be inferred from the initial analysis of the data: 1) space flight has elicited an effect on maintenance of spermatogenesis. Another, equally viable conclusion is that space flight has compromised the blood-testis barrier and the changes are due to mounting of an inflammatory response that will compromise spermatogenesis due to a breach of the blood-testis barrier. Long-established ground-based data has demonstrated that if the BTB has been breached then spermatogenesis will eventually decline and cause infertility. If a true immune response has been raised, then sperm autoantibodies will likely be generated, also causing infertility. Both of these conditions are common causes of human male factor infertility. Further analysis of these samples is required to distinguish between these potential conclusions, including analyzing for the presence of macrophage invasion, and other biomarkers of normal versus exacerbated immune reaction.\nSperm motility assessment showed that swimming velocity is significantly increased in sperm that developed in 30 days of space flight. This is an interesting finding since it has been previously shown that bovine sperm swim faster during brief exposure to microgravity in sounding rocket experiments. Why sperm collected from animals that were exposed to space flight conditions for 30 days also show higher swimming velocity will require additional analysis in future space flight experiments using rodents.\nThe testis, as the key organ of the male reproductive system has the double function of spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis. Space flight induced a nearly 3-fold increase in the percent of abnormal seminiferous tubules in mice, from 10.5 ± 1.7% in ground controls to 26.2 ± 4.6% in flight animals (P<0.003), including spermatogenic layer disorganization, early release of spermatids and changes of testosterone-producing Leydig cell morphology. An decreased presence of CD68 positive cells has been noted in flight testis Leydig cells and some Sertoli cells compared to GC testis, and in the testis interstitium of flight group. Testis is considered an immunoprivileged organ; it can orchestrate immune responses.  Histopathology of the testis suggests that the immune/inflammatory response is related to the observed network pathway induced changes by space flight. One obvious question is whether similar flight-induced pathway changes occurred in other tissues including thymus, bone and muscle.\nThese findings are also of significant impact with respect to the well-known negative impact of space flight on the immune system in general. One obvious question is whether similar flight-induced pathway changes occurred in other tissues such as thymus (important for immune response) and other tissues where immune responses could elicit space-flight effects such as bone and muscle. These immune pathways all have the H2Aa, H2Ab1, and H2Eb1 genes in common.  The tightness of the cluster also highlights the significance of the interactions of the pathways in the space flight effect.\nThe preliminary data analysis identified the following interacting genes that were differentially regulated in the testis of space mice vs. ground mice. These genes are known to interact highly. These genes are part of the HLA gene family, which encode a group of related proteins known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.\nIt must be stressed that this initial pathway analysis of the data is limited to identification of the pathways affected and how they relate to each other. We still need to 1) independently verify the changes by RT-PCR, and 2) determine the physiologic consequence of the changes with respect to stimulated or inhibited output of the pathway. This requires a more detailed analysis of the pathways and the component genes to determine the net change in regulatory pathway signaling and biomarker outcomes. For example, if stimulatory genes are upregulated and inhibitory genes are down regulated within a pathway, then the net change will be to stimulate that pathway. Conversely, if the stimulatory genes are down regulated, and the inhibitory genes are upregulated, then the net change in the pathway will be inhibited. The physiologic consequences of such interactions are particularly important for gene products that directly interact as functional regulators.\nFrom the preliminary Upstream Analysis in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis the following regulators and signal transduction molecules and hormones are predicted to be involved with our highly interacting gene list. Additional analysis is needed to ascertain if the signaling pathways involving these regulatory pathways were upregulated or down-regulated by space flight. The results of such analysis will elucidate the physiologic consequences of the changes with respect to testicular function. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis is using a more relaxed cutoff as some of these genes found in these pathways don’t meet the 1.2 fold q<.05 requirements. However, they are still significant by p-value and really just miss the cutoff. When using a relaxed cutoff list of genes in NCBI’s David (an alternative method for pathway analysis) the same pathways come up as significant for the kegg pathways, and this is again based on the predominant identified HLA genes affected by space flight.\nThe testis, as the key organ of the male reproductive system has the double function of spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis. Space flight significantly increased the % of abnormal seminiferous tubules in mice (P<0.01), including spermatogenic layer disorganization, early release of spermatids and abnormal morphology of testosterone-producing Leydig cells. CD68 positive cells were found in both GC and flight group testes. However, in flight animals, CD68-containing macrophages were present exclusively in the interstitial compartment. NextGen comparison of gene expression profiles between flight and GC showed only 0.3% of the entire genome was significantly changed, indicating that the space flight effect is focused on a small subset of genes in the testis. Up-regulated genes are mostly reproductive tissue-specific, but with known impacts in other systems. Down-regulated genes commonly involved in metabolic and inflammatory control, express in different organs, and also down-regulated in STS-131 flight group mouse uteri. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that significant interacting pathways induced in testis by space flight are involved in immune/inflammatory system regulation and response. Testis is an immunoprivileged organ--it can orchestrate immune responses by regulating the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in the Sertoli, Leydig, and peritubular cells. The histopathology of the testis in flight is consistent with alterations in the immune/inflammatory response pathways changes induced by space flight. The increase in inflammatory response and alterations in the Leydig cell population suggest that long term space flight will compromise testis function.\nIn addition to the major foci of immune regulatory pathways, other gene changes were found that have essential regulatory functions on systems whose phenotype would show space-flight effects in other systems include wound healing, cancer, bone and muscle, and endocrine regulation. It should be noted that our findings in testis of male mice from BION were matched with identical changes of the same genes in uteri of female mice from STS-131 and STS-135. Key genes that were significantly decreased in both the male and female in space flight included: FAB4 (inflammatory response, multiple organ neoplasias), CFD (metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, renal and urologic disorders), CA3 (endometrial cancers, skeletal muscle metabolism), and Cd74 (immune response).\nOf particular significance is the reduction in 3ß hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3ß-HSD). We found over a 50% reduction in the expression of this gene (P < 0.05) in space flight compared to ground controls. 3ß-HSD is a critical gatekeeper enzyme in the synthesis of all the major metabolic and reproductive steroid hormones including progesterone, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. The decline in the expression of this gene product is consistent with the much wider physiologic decline in multiple organ systems observed in space flight that are regulated by these steroid hormones including bone, muscle, cardiovascular, immune system, metabolism, regulation of intracranial pressure, as well as the reproductive system.",

The design of this Russian flight experiment was based on group-housed male mice (three adult male, C57/Bl6 mice per compartment). Some of the mice were equipped with implanted telemetry equipment that provided heart rate and blood pressure data. Significantly for the present report, the Bion compartments provided on-board video surveillance of the mice, with significant volume of daily storage. Upon landing, the present effort included post-flight behavioral testing of the mice.\nConventional wisdom has long held that unrelated adult male mice cannot be housed together without competition over resources such as space and access to resources, pathological stress, and fighting. NASA has incorporated such concerns into their life sciences operations, thus limiting the use of this valuable mammalian model for flight-based investigations. Bion M-1 procedures and results contributed an important alteration to the conventional wisdom, and the video data and direct observations that comprised the present investigations provide valuable information.\nWe learned that the Russian scientists employed several innovative, yet simple techniques to produce triads of unrelated adult male mice that lived amicably in the small housing compartments for one month. This was accomplished by establishing, in their laboratory vivarium, triads of adult males. They were housed in a standard cage and provided a shelter apparatus to share. Mice that did not share the shelter were thus screen and eliminated from the pool. There followed a regime of daily handling. These animals were also maintained at about 90% ad lib body weight for purposes of operant training. These procedures yielded groups of adult males that lived together amicably in the Bion habitats in microgravity and under Earth-based control conditions. Their excellent performance violated the conventional wisdom and provides an important example of how we might well use group-housed male mice in future studies.",

This approach allows the study of compound-target relationships in the context of a living cell with a systems biology view that includes both the cell target and the interdependent networks that respond to chemical stress. The modulation of yeast colonies, especially the redox potential, allows study of different drug pathways.\nThis application investigates microbial metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast.  Our previous work has largely defined yeast cellular stress defense response to microgravity, but stress defense responses are only involved in the survival of yeast in liquid cultures.  It has recently been found that survival of plate-based yeast colonies is dependent on signaling mediated through ammonia which drives the multicellular yeast colony to differentiate into two populations, L or lower cells and U or upper cells.  These two populations have different metabolic pathways and establish a cycle of nutrients that allows the U cells to continue to proliferate at the leading edge.  Without ammonia signaling, the entire colony dies. Lack of convection in space is likely to dramatically impact signaling by ammonia, a volatile gas. We postulate that the flow of nutrient and ammonia signals will differ in microgravity where there is little to no convection. We hypothesize that yeast colony survival in microgravity depends on ammonia mediated metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation rather than on stress defense. To test our hypothesis, we will identify the mechanisms mediating colony stratification into U and L cells under multiple gravitational environments: microgravity emulated by Rotating Wall Vessel and Random Positioning Device, static one g cultures, and ultimately microgravity of space flight. Our experimental model will compare liquid and solid phase yeast cultures and make use of available mutant strains of yeast with deletion of the enzymes involved in ammonia signaling and the connected alternative metabolism activation, enzymes involved in stress responses, and the Msn4 promoter and SSA4 gene that we have previously identified as mediating response to microgravity.  Relevant metabolic pathways will be studied using green fluorescent protein-linked reporter genes that can be analyzed by confocal microscopy of intact colonies, and flow cytometry of cells divided into L and U populations by sucrose density centrifugation. There are similarities between multicellular yeast colonies and tumors of clusters of mammalian cells in tissue culture.  Thus insights into the effect of microgravity on cell to cell signaling may have far-reaching applications.\nMicrogravity could provide a physiologically responsive test bed for drug pathway analysis at diverse redox states.",

This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al. 2009a; Ayer et al. 2014; Herker et al. 2004). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based colonies (Cap et al. 2009a). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colony is dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification of the population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling (Cap et al. 2009a). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays using a deletion series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small molecules in vivo including chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al. 2010). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colony on solid agar models many of the changes seen within solid tumors (Cap et al. 2009a, 2010, 2012a, d).\nYeast is also a popular model for studies of cellular responses to microgravity and microgravity simulations. Multiple flight experiments have verified that S. cerevisiae remains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism [e.g., increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and Volz 1979) and phenotype [e.g., increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al. 1996)]. Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responses of liquid culture yeast to real (e.g., space flight) microgravity and simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a, b; Hammond et al. 1999; Johanson et al. 2002; Nislow et al. 2015). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role in the responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al. 2015). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al. 2008a).\nThe first steps in this initiative were to validate assays for reactive oxygen species and glutathione in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during microgravity simulation.\nThe effects of space flight on yeast have high concordance with agents that induce a very low intracellular redox state, and induce a massive efflux of glutathione. These results raise important issues. Can the reduced redox state during space flight be reproduced and modulated in ground-based simulations? Will this allow definition of unique drug pathways, as a low redox state mirrors the electrophilic properties of mitochondria, where many drugs are metabolized? Unfortunately, assays for redox status and its major cellular determinant, glutathione, are diverse, often cell type specific, and we lack an accepted probe set for yeast studies. This paper validates fluorescent probes for glutathione and reactive oxygen status in yeast to support mechanistic studies of microgravity and drug metabolism. The plethora of fluorescent reagents for reactive oxygen species and glutathione can be bewildering, and makes head-to-head comparisons of all the alternatives impractical. These reagents measure the physiological milieu of reactive oxygen species and diverse thiols, rather than specific individual molecules. We report that in yeast, monochlorobimane (mBCL) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DC-FDA) are suitable for fluorometric and flow cytometry studies of glutathione and reactive oxygen species, respectively. Both dyes have low background fluorescence, predictable loading, good retention, and are non-toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both dyes show concordance with other fluorescent and biochemical assays of reactive oxygen species.\nThe second step in this initiative was to establish the timing, optimal media (rich versus poor) a dynamic range of rotational interventions for low redox potential in giant yeast colonies.  Giant yeast colonies develop a low redox potential, which mimics the electrophilic milieu of both the mitochondrial drug metabolizing compartment, and the hypoxic core of many tumors. The major metabolic mediators of this low redox potential include ATP, glutathione, NAD+/NADH, and NADP+/NADPH. Ammonia signaling is the critical mechanism that induces stratification of the giant yeast colonies to allow a low redox potential. Comparison of two powerful investigative models for drug pathways using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been compounded by the use of different growth media and stimuli to the system. Chemogenetic profiling, which uses a pool of yeast deletion mutants to determine survival changes, is heavily slanted to the use of rich media. Giant yeast colonies studies are heavily slanted to the use of poor media. The current study answers three questions. First, what are the differences in redox potential and its major metabolic mediators in giant yeast colonies over time? Metabolic status is assayed as glutathione content, redox potential, ATP content, and ratios of NAD to NADH and NADP to NADPH. Second, how does rich versus poor media affect physiological responses of giant yeast colonies? Third, how does clinorotation affect redox potential and its metabolic mediators? Clinorotation is of interest because it randomizes the gravitational vector. That in turn should disrupt the convection-medicated ammonia signaling known to drive giant yeast colony stratification and differentiation. This study demonstrates that the low redox potential status in tumors and drug metabolizing areas of mitochondria can be reproduced in giant yeast colonies grown on both poor and rich media. The study defines the time course and effects of middle molecule mediators from glutathione and ATP to the NAD family of mediators. Rotation proved to be a potent way to selectively modulate ammonia signaling, redox potential, and metabolic mediators.\nThe third step in this initiative was to determine if lack of convection of gaseous ammonia in true microgravity changes the stratification and expansion of in giant yeast models of differentiation and tumorgenesis.\nLittle is known about the effects of space flight on yeast growing as a colony on agar. On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al. 2009b, 2012b, c). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly, thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity driven convection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeast colony differentiation (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). It is not known how the absence of convection seen in microgravity might affect this process.\nTo answer this question, we studied giant yeast colonies formed in true microgravity (i.e., space flight) and in two ground-based simulations of microgravity: rotation and random positioning. Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during space flight (Hammond and Hammond 2001; Lee et al. 2014; Birdsall et al. 2016). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cells and gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al. 2016). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of ‘gravity-vector-averaging’, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al. 2014). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and true microgravity (Grimm et al. 2014), and controversy as to whether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al. 2004; Murdoch et al. 2013; Wuest et al. 2017).\nMetabolic adaption in giant yeast colonies is triggered by the depletion of nutrients in the agar and to enhance this process colonies are typically grown on nutrient-poor agar (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). In contrast, studies of yeast in liquid cultures, including chemical genomic assays, tend to use rich media. To evaluate the role of nutrients, we conducted parallel studies of yeast on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient poor (YE) media.\nThree major analyzes were conducted in yeast grown as giant colonies under true and simulated microgravity. First, we measured the expression of a series of genes likely to be affected by microgravity using clones engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Table 1 lists the clones used and the rationale for their selection. ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies (Cap et al. 2012a, d). BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in space flight (Walther et al. 1996). TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox (Birdsall et al. 2016; Cap et al. 2012d) and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species (Trotter and Grant 2005). EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect (Kshirsagar and Parker 2004).  Second, we evaluated the dependence of two stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, on the stress promoters, Msn4 and Sfp1 (Johanson et al. 2002). We have previously shown that in liquid yeast cultures, SSA4 and RPL34b have novel transcription dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 during space flight that differs from ground-based controls (Coleman et al. 2008a).\nThird, we evaluated the viability and induction of apoptosis in the giant yeast colonies and the dependence of these outcomes on the stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1. The differentiation of giant yeast colonies in terrestrial analyzes is dependent on the promoters Msn4 and Sfp1 (Cap et al. 2012b) but the effects of microgravity on this process are not known.\n100 µ l of stationary culture inocula of each yeast strain were placed in 5 ml of fresh YPD or YE media and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 30°C. Omniwell plates prefilled with 40ml of YE or YPD agar were spotted with 60 µ l of the overnight liquid culture with forty-eight spots per plate. To minimize dehydration after drying the Omniwell lids were sealed to the base with Durapore tape and the plates were placed in plastic Ziploc™ bags. The plates were cooled to 4°C and were divided into five sets of four plates - one set for each of the five growth conditions. Each set contained a full series on YPD agar and a full series on YE agar.\nFlight and static ground control plates were sent to Kennedy Space Center in chilled shipping containers. Just prior to flight, working in a cold room, the plates were transferred to barcoded Ziploc™ bag and stacks of eight were placed in Lexan bags and then into plate habitats (PHABs;\nhttp://www-bioserve.colorado.edu/tech_Sheets_pdfs/SelectBioServeHardware.pdf\n; BioServe Space Technologies, CO). The PHAB is a sealed container that allows for gas exchange but meets NASA safety requirements for levels of containment. (\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/life_support_systems/crew_payload/index.html\n). PHABs were placed in cold bags at 4°C, and remained chilled for five days during handoff to the SpaceX-8 rocket. Flight samples were flown to the International Space Station (ISS). Approximately two days post-launch, the growth of the yeast on ISS was initiated by transferring the PHABs to Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4 (CGBA4) (Hoehn et al. 2004) that was set to 30°C (BioServe Space Technologies, CO). After 28 days in flight, CGBA4 was commanded down to +4°C. The following day the PHABs were moved back to cold bags, and returned to Earth the next day on the Dragon capsule. Plates remained chilled for a total of six days during undocking, return to Earth, salvage, and transport to the lab for flow cytometry analysis.\nThe second set of plates, the static flight controls were loaded into a second set of PHABs at Kennedy Space Center and handled to match the exact timing and temperature profile of the flight samples. Ground controls were conducted with a 24-hour offset relative to the flight samples and the static controls in PHABs followed the same temperature changes as the flown samples.\nA third and fourth set of samples were subjected to Wall-Vessel rotation or random positioning (RPM) during growth. The timing of the rotating and RPM cultures matched that of the flight samples with the exception that they were grown at ambient laboratory conditions (25°C) rather than 30°C and they were not placed in PHABs. To control for the difference, an additional set of static ground controls were maintained in plastic bags at 25°C and also not placed in PHABs. Results from the two set of static controls, PHABs/30°C versus no-PHAB/25°C, did not differ (Pearson correlation >95%) so data from the two were pooled in the statistical analyzes. Similarly, we could not detect any differences due to plate position of the replication using any of the modalities studied (Pearson correlation >95%).\nWe have previously reported on the effects of media and rotation on the viability and redox potential in giant yeast colonies in ground-based studies (Birdsall et al. 2016). In this report, we extend analysis to include giant yeast colonies in the true microgravity of space flight as well as in the microgravity simulation by random positioning (RPM) and 2D rotation (Rotating Wall-Vessel head) positioning. Defining the utility of microgravity and microgravity simulations is confounded by use of different microgravity simulations, different media, and different outcomes. This study is a systematic examination of the effects of true microgravity versus common microgravity simulations, and nutrient rich media versus nutrient poor media, on major mechanistic mediators including shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. This lays the ground work for future yeast experiments to study cell-to-cell interactions, cell signaling, cell survival, colony differentiation and aging, mechanisms of drug action, and characteristics of tumor generation.\nCell death by necrosis and apoptosis increased in flight as shown by multiple modalities: uptake of propidium iodide up, expression of caspase, and binding of annexin V. Induction of apoptosis by simulated microgravity has been seen with other cell types including human lymphocytes (Ward et al. 2006). This increased cell death was greatly increased by deletion of either of the stress responsive promoters Msn4 or Sfp1. The finding of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is further evidence for activity of both ammonia signaling and stress defense pathways, as ammonia signaling utilizes mostly caspase independent pathways (Vachova and Palkova 2005) and stress defense is mediated mostly by apoptosis as well as autophagy and necrosis (Farrugia and Balzan 2012).\nThe changes in INO1 and SSA4 genes are significant in both random positioning with gravity vector averaging and rotation techniques but oppositely directed to the space flight changes, underscoring the uniqueness of the effects of true microgravity. During culture on the ISS, yeast cultures are also exposed to increased radiation (Nislow et al. 2015). Our previous studies using yeast deletion series in liquid culture to evaluate the effects of space flight revealed two dominant responses: radiation/DNA repair and reactive oxygen pathways (Nislow et al. 2015). We conclude that the ISS provides a unique suite of stimuli with distinct set of responses: the question is how to translate these properties to i) further NASA’s program objectives, ii) support commercial development, and iii) address unmet clinical needs.  We found differences in the responses of yeast in the rotating wall vessel versus random positioning models in both ammonia-dependent and stress-dependent changes, providing clarity to the controversy as to whether the random positioning device is a form of rotation, or a distinct stimulus (Klaus 2001; Klaus et al. 2004). These differences included gene expression changes mediated by shear stress promoters, redox status, and apoptosis. Hence, we conclude that the forces induced by random positioning and rotation are distinct. Many resources are available for scientists seeking to study the effects of gravity on biologic systems (Brungs et al. 2016; Frett et al. 2016) and researchers should be mindful that fluidity of the culture milieu and shear stress at the membrane surface are likely to be important variables affecting how cells sense gravity (Kohn et al. 2017; van Loon 2008). In our model system composed of a near-solid colony of yeast, receiving nutrients from an agar gel at its base, and using a gas, ammonia, as one means of driving differentiation within the colony, space flight, rotating wall vessel and random positioning generate different effects. In free-floating liquid systems such as U937 cells growing in suspension (Bradamante et al. 2006), HUVEC cells adherent to Cytodex beads (Bradamante et al. 2006), or thyroid cells growing as spheroids (Warnke et al. 2016) rotating wall vessel, random positioning machines, and space flight had very similar effects.\nThe ability of physical methods to manipulate yeast colony redox, apoptosis, and stress defense status is important at multiple levels of organismal biology. Gene deletion, although targeted to a single locus, will often cause follow-on effects in multiple integrated pathways, especially when promoters are deleted (Park et al. 2011). Further, there are clinically important applications. Analysis of yeast survival pathways offers powerful techniques to address drug metabolic mechanisms for repurposing of pharmaceuticals (Lee et al. 2014), including identification of unique targets (Blackman et al. 2012) and buffering pathways required to respond to drugs. Further, yeast colony differentiation recapitulates many of the stratification mechanisms of tumorigenesis (Cap et al. 2012a, d; Birdsall et al. 2016). In conclusion, by allowing graded manipulation of a combination of convection and ammonia signaling, while avoiding secondary effects of gene deletion, these physical techniques are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.  The fourth step in this initiative was to determine the gene pathways, which mediate space based changes in giant yeast colony differentiation as a tumorogenesis model.\nOur data shows that space flight on the ISS appeared to have a unique pattern on DNA damage.  The logical next step is to combine this genome sequencing data with functional data in order to investigate the biological consequence(s) of deleting a particular genes and the subsequent accumulation of mutations.\nThe hypothesis to be tested is that yeast double deletion pools can be used to identify genes conferring resistance to space/cosmic radiation.\nThe traditional approach is to create double mutants that contain combinations of each mutation of interest (the query mutation) with a mutation in a second gene (Dixon et al., 2009).  This experimental approach exploits the phenomenon of synthetic lethality in which a combination of mutations in two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a mutation in only one of these genes is not, in itself, lethal.  Synthetic lethality is currently of great interest in the study of cancer.  Synthetic lethality can help us understand how cells become cancerous by overcoming the redundant cellular quality control mechanisms.  It can also be a potential way to selectively kill cancer cells by identifying drugs that can target and inactivate synthetic lethal genes that act in concert with cancer-driver genes. Our previous radiation work in space has not addressed synthetic lethality at all.\nWe generated double mutant libraries in which the mutated DNA repair gene (mutation #1) is paired with a homozygous deletion of another yeast gene (mutation #2).  Each pool contains approximately ˜ 4600 double-mutant strains, representing deletion of each of the nonessential genes in the yeast genome combined with mutation #1. In “fitness profiling” the mutants were grown and the relative quantity of each clone was measured (Roemer et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010).  The samples were flown cold to the ISS, allowed to grow while exposed to cosmic radiation on station, and returned to ground.  Recent innovations in sample preparation allowed us to fly these experiments at ambient temperatures, which required minimal crew input to initiate the experiment, and produced a small payload. Furthermore, because the experiment was limited by nutrient availability (e.g., the yeast grow until the nutrients are depleted then remain in a quiescent state), the experimental set up is a closed system that did not require any additional intervention or specialized post-experiment storage requirements. Finally, the generation of these double mutant pools provides sufficient stock material for ~5000 ground based follow-on experiments using the sample aliquots, and can be stored indefinitely.\nTo prepare the second mutation in each clone, both copies of each of the ˜ 4600 nonessential genes in the yeast genome is removed by genetic engineering.  The mutated clone is able to thrive so long as there is no external stressor targeting that particular gene’s protein.  However, in the presence of the stressor (e.g., cosmic radiation), the clone is overwhelmed and grows less well compared to clones with irrelevant mutations.  To discriminate the clones in the series, each clone’s deleted gene has been replaced with a unique DNA bar code.  The entire series can be grown together in the presence of the stressor, the DNA extracted, and the numbers of each clone quantified by high throughput sequencing or hybridization to gene chips (Smith et al., 2010).  The ‘clone-identifying’ barcode is unique to each clone, but the insert is flanked by up and down DNA sequences that are identical in every clone so that the extracted DNA for all clones can be amplified together.  All of the techniques proposed have been used and validated in space flight (Johanson et al., 2007; Nislow et al., 2015).\nMultiple double mutation pools were prepared corresponding to sentinel DNA-sensitive mutant strains. These pools were made robotically, rapidly, and inexpensively (Giaever and Nislow, 2014).    The result of the chemogenomic assay is a quantitative metric, termed \"fitness\", presented as a list of genes ranked in order of their importance for growth and survival in the presence versus the absence of the stressor (space flight/cosmic radiation vs ground).  Accordingly a ranked list of all genes in the genome was generated for each experiment and then compared using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to define those pathways and processes that were affected by growth in microgravity using Cytoscape (Wallace et al., 2011).\nDetecting differentially fit genes from next generation sequencing or microarray data involves a set of statistical tradeoffs. Standard methods look for genes by relying on elementary test statistics using data from one gene at a time (such as t-tests, or contrasts from ANOVA models). Gene lists are obtained by filtering statistics by attempting to control overall type-I error, or false discovery rate, or by filtering using a user specified cutoff level. The tradeoff between controlling Type I errors, due to the large number of comparisons, and maintaining power can be handled in a variety of ways. These methods include but are not limited to False Discovery Rate analysis including Storey statistics, Bayesian analysis, and many other mapping techniques.\nSpecific comparisons provide internal controls. We were able to identify most of the nonessential genes previously shown to be involved in nucleotide excision repair, in cell cycle checkpoints, in homologous recombination, and in post replication repair after other forms of radiation damage. This validates the space-based assay by acting as a positive control.\nSecond, comparison is being made of the ISS data to existing data sets in this model  on UV irradiation, alkayating radiomimetic agents, and our prior ISS data. Especially in the deletion pool using the wild type background, this should elucidate if the changes in space have unique pathways.\nThe experiments performed in space flight and ground-based controls directly address Human Research Program and Space Biology Science Plan's research goals, objectives, and guiding questions that underlie our project's unifying hypothesis: \"Microgravity-induced changes in yeast are induced, at least in part, through changes in density driven ammonia convection and the subsequent effects on Msn4- and Sfp1-dependent genetic and cellular differentiation of giant yeast colonies.\"  Each experiment is identifying specific target genes and the transcription factors that mediate the changes using reporter synthetic genetic array methodology or gene expression.\nThe Micro 9 experiment flew on SpaceX-8, spending one month on the ISS.  There were zero defects in either the ISS or parallel ground control experiments.  All four experiments included static and rotated ground controls.  Experiments 3 and 4, ground controls with a random positioning machine, were also conducted.\nExperiment 1.  Evaluate the role of ammonia and reactive oxygen species in the response to space flight using synthetic gene array technology.    \tThe yeast deletion series were prepared in a background of suppressed thioredoxin reductase activity (TRR1DAmp).  Thioredoxin reductase is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species.  Yeast deletion series were also prepared in a background of deleted SOK2, so that they are unable to synthesize ammonia, a key signaling molecule in the biochemical differentiation of giant yeast colonies.  Responses in these series were compared to yeast deletions series in a wild type background.\nIndividual clones were spotted on rich agar for fitness profiling.  Pools of each series were also spotted on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor agar as nutrient status affects generation of reactive oxygen species.  The agars were prepared with and without addition of the DNA-damaging agent 0.1 mM doxorubicin, as an additional stressor.\nExperiment 2:  Evaluate the response to space flight with radiation-sensitive clones.    \tEach of the 26 rad deletion addresses a different DNA damage response with different specific target gene and transcription factor responses in ground-based studies.\nExperiment 3: Evaluate the role of Sfp1 and Msn4 transcription factors in the expression of SSA4 and RPL34B by giant yeast colonies grown in real and emulated microgravity.  \teGFP-expressing SSa4 (YER103W) and  RPL34B clones with and without deletion of Msn4 & Sfp1 transcription factors were used.  RPL34B and SSa4 were selected because  we had previously found that their dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 is altered in microgravity in liquid cultures.  Specific clones were:  Ssa4 (YER103W); Sfp1 delta Ssa4; Msn4 delta Ssa4; RPL34B (YIL052c); Sfp1 delta RPL34B; Msn4 delta RPL34B.  Yeast were evaluated for shear stress gene expression, cell death, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry.\nExperiment 4:  Evaluate the expression of genes in giant yeast colonies grown in real and simulated microgravity.    \teGFP-expressing yeast clones were spotted on nutrient rich and nutrient poor agar.  Yeast were evaluated for shear stress gene expression, cell death, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry.\nThe rationale for the clones selected is as follows:  ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies.  BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in space flight.  TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species.  EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect.\nFor all samples, DNA has been extracted, the reporting bar codes have been amplified by PCR, and sequencing libraries prepared.  Next generation sequencing has been completed, as has initial analyses by Gene Set enrichment Analysis (GSEA).  Visualization and probability modeling by Cytoscape and ClueGO is ongoing.\nAll OMICS data will be annotated and deposited in the NASA GeneLab portal.\nReferences\nAyer, A., Gourlay, C.W., Dawes, I.W.: Cellular redox homeostasis, reactive oxygen species and replicative ageing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

            "task_description": "Plants experiencing spaceflight are quite normal in appearance but can exhibit growth habits distinctly different from plants on Earth. Historically the spaceflight-induced differences were difficult to dissect due to changing hardware and flight conditions. With the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) and a consistent International Space Station (ISS) orbital environment, it is now possible to confidently approach a dissection of the molecular biology guiding the altered growth of plants in spaceflight. This proposal involves experiments that specifically address growth and molecular changes in Arabidopsis that occur during spaceflight, bringing the molecular and genetic tools of Arabidopsis to bear on fundamental questions of root morphology, growth, and cell wall remodeling. During the Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit - Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System (APEX-TAGES) experiments, we observed a remarkable number of gene expression changes during spaceflight that are associated with cell wall restructuring, especially in roots. We also observed, with the ABRS/GIS (GFP Imaging System) imaging system, genetically dependent changes in root growth direction, movement, and structure. The current experiments will employ the ABRS and the GIS to dissect and better understand the molecular changes guiding growth restructuring on orbit. In particular we hypothesize that spaceflight conditions engender a constant state of root cell wall modification during the cell file rotations that characterize spaceflight-induced root skewing. The specific experiments will involve mutants in root growth and cell wall signaling pathways identified in our previous spaceflight molecular studies, as well as new Green Fluorescent Protein biosensor lines also based on the genes identified in the previous flight experiments.\nThe overall goal of our program is to understand fundamental molecular biological responses to extraterrestrial environments. This goal aligns with fundamental Space Biology goals to understand the impact of spaceflight on biological systems to better enable the exploration imperative. We have used molecular biology and genetically tagged plants as biological monitors of spaceflight and space-related environments with great science return, leading to the development of new biological and hardware tools to study the spaceflight response with even higher fidelity in a wider variety of spaceflight-related environments. The focus of the current proposal is to build on these data and other insights gained from the execution of the APEX-TAGES experiments in the ABRS /GIS, advancing science while also advancing the telemetric imaging hardware and biological experiment support for the ISS and future platforms\nGaining insights into such mechanisms is recognized as fundamental within the decadal study and underpins answers to some of the biggest questions in spaceflight plant biology.",

            "task_progress": "Final Summary:\nThe APEX03 experiment was a natural follow-on of the APEX01 experiment, and is an outstanding example of how the ISS can be utilized as an exploration laboratory to more science forward in a given field.  In APEX01 we showed that plants responded to the spaceflight environment in a highly tissue-specific manner, and that cell wall remodeling played a large role in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Further, we refuted the paradigm set forth by Darwin in the 1880s that plants require gravity to initiate the root behavior called “skewing,” and fluorescent reporter genes suggested that there were changes in auxin signaling over time on orbit. In APEX03 we set forth to dissect the molecular changes over a developmental time course, utilize mutants in critical skewing and cell wall remodeling signal transduction pathways, and also use targeted fluorescent imaging of auxin-regulated genes in the specific cells of the root tip that guide root navigation.\nAlthough the transcriptome analyses are ongoing, preliminary data suggest that development age plays a substantial role in the physiological adaptation process Transcriptomes were first evaluated four days after germination, where there were numerous differentially expressed genes (compared to ground controls). A set of sister plants were evaluated 8 days after germination on orbit, and it was found that as the plants develop, the number of genes needed to satisfy the needs of the physiological adaptation process diminishes.\nIn the on orbit microscopy experiments (utilizing the Light Microscopy module – the LMM) we found that auxin distributions in the gravity-sensing cells of the primary root are not gravity dependent, even though these distributions are key to gravity responses on Earth. It is therefore likely that the role of gravity is minimal compared to the inherent developmental cues guided by auxin to define the architecture of the root tip.  Those developmental auxin gradients were co-opted then to be sensitive to gravity responses and it seems logical then that the auxin signaling system in roots was present in plants as a developmental system before evolving additional roles in gravity responses. These data actually changed aspects of a long held paradigm in plant biology that gravity is central to setting up the gradient of auxin distribution in a vertically growing root – called the “reverse fountain” model of auxin distribution. The term “vertical” carries a direct association with the gravity vector. Without the ability to remove gravity from the plant environment, there was no reason to eliminate the term from the vernacular or the force of gravity from the concept. Our results show that the reverse fountain is neither reverse nor a fountain, as these terms imply that gravity is involved in the reversal of liquid flow. Rather, the auxin flow of the primary root tip is fundamentally no different from the auxin flow systems that guide other parts of plant primary development, except that it has been further engaged in the gravity response.",

            "task_description": "How plants respond to gravity is a fundamental biological question with important implications for spaceflight. Here we propose ground-based research designed to lead to spaceflight, in the area of plant biology. Our experimental approach focuses on several families of putative mechanoreceptors known as mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. MS ion channels have been proposed to play a role in the perception of gravity in plants for many years, a hypothesis that is supported by several lines of evidence, but one that has not yet been systematically tested by molecular genetics. The research plan utilizes contemporary methodologies for the study of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to interrogate the biological function of plant MS ion channels and builds upon previous NASA-funded research into the response of plants to altered gravity environments. We will determine the role played by MS ion channels in mediating gravity signal transduction, their putative roles in adaptation to microgravity, and the molecular mechanisms by which the model MS ion channel MSL10 activates stress-response pathways in plant cells. We expect that these activities will have the following outcomes: 1) Test the long-standing hypothesis that MS ion channels function in gravity perception; 2) Contribute to our basic knowledge regarding how plants exploit MS ion channels to sense and respond to mechanical stress; 3) Provide information that could be used on Earth to improve crop productivity; and 4) Establish a foundation of knowledge required to generate more mechanistic and sophisticated hypotheses about plant gravity perception that can be tested in spaceflight using the European Modular Cultivation System and/or the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Imaging system. (These proposed studies directly address the objectives of the solicitation, as they aim to answer basic questions about how plants respond to changes in gravity and should lead to hypotheses that can be tested on future spaceflights.)",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Identifying the molecular mechanisms by which MS ion channels function and evaluating their roles in the perception and response to altered gravity conditions will help fill a large gap in our knowledge regarding the molecules involved in gravity and mechanoperception. Gaining this knowledge has the potential to achieve two long-term goals: 1) to mitigate the effects of mechanical stress on crop plants on Earth, and 2) to counteract the effects of altered gravity environments on plants grown in space. These experiments will address the high priority goal of “understanding the basic mechanisms of plant response” to changes in gravity described in the Decadal survey of 2011."

            "task_progress": "Research Progress May 2016-July 2017\nAim 1: Test the Hypothesis that MS ion channels Play a Role in Root Gravitropism Using a Machine Vision and Computation Approach. Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels have been implicated in a variety of steps in gravity signaling, but are most often implicated in the initial gravity response. MS ion channels have been proposed to sense ER membrane tension as a result of the amyloplasts sedimentation; the plasma membrane tension resulting from the uneven pressure of the tonoplast at the bottom of the cell; or the action of amyloplasts on actin microfilaments tethered to the plasma membrane. There are at least three potential barriers to the identification of MS ion channels in forward genetic screens for genes involved in gravity response: 1) redundancy of MS ion channel gene function; 2) redundancy of gravity response pathways involving MS ion channels; and 3) subtle effects of MS ion channel function on the gravity response. We aim to test the long-held hypothesis that MS ion channels mediate the perception of changes in gravity vector using a reverse genetics approach and a highly sensitive Machine Vision and Computation assay for defects in gravity perception.\nProgress: We further characterized the gravity defect in the msl2 msl3 mutants. The msl2 msl3 double mutant lacks MS channels in the plastid envelope. While the msl2 msl3 mutant shows overall defects in orientation when grown vertically on solid media, or on a re-positioning machine, there are developmental defects that complication interpretation. Several aspects of cellular morphology that are key for gravity response disappear or appear disorganized in msl2 msl3 mutants compared to those in wild type seedlings. We tested a range of media with added osmotic support and saw that we could suppress these phenotypes to some degree, but in the end were unable to generate growth conditions where root growth was normal enough to feel confident that defects in gravity could be attributed to perception rather than to anatomical differences.\nWe worked towards generating msl9 msl10 pgm and msl4 msl5 msl6 pgm mutants.\nWe tested several AtPiezo CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockouts for gravity defects but did not observe any.\nAim 2: Test the Hypothesis that MSL and other MS ion channels are involved in the perception and/or Adaptation to Weightlessness.\nProgress: We do not have progress to report on this aim.\nAim 3: Determine the Molecular Mechanism of MSL10-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Signaling. MS ion channels are implicated in the perception and/or response to changes in gravity conditions. The experiments in this aim are designed to gain a more molecular and mechanistic handle on the regulation and signaling behavior of MS ion channels, building on our recent observations that overexpressing the MscS-Like MS ion channel MSL10 from A. thaliana leads to ROS-associated cell death. Understanding how MSL10 is regulated and how its activation leads to ROS-related stress signaling may be important for mitigating the effects of mechanical stress on crop plants or plants in the space environment.\nProgress:\nA. We established that endogenous expression of unphosphorylated MSL10 and a single point mutation the MSL10 C-terminus result in the hyper-accumulation of ROS. Furthermore, the chaperone complex SGT1/RAR1/HSP90 is required for this phenomenon.\nPrevious years we showed that overexpression of MSL10 leads to cell death signaling and the production of ROS at endogenous levels of expression. Now we can say that dephosphorylation-dependent cell death signaling does not require overexpression of MSL10, as we observe cell death, dwarfing, and the production of ROS in plants expressing phospho-dead MSL10, but not phospho-mimic MSL10 at endogenous levels. Furthermore, a single EMS-induced point mutation in the MSL10 C terminus, S640L, produces the same phenotypes.\nHSP90 and its co-chaperone SGT1 play a conserved role in plant and animal innate immunity by stabilizing pathogen sensors called NLR proteins. It was also recently reported that HSP90 and SGT1 stabilize a hormone receptor in response to heat stress, indicating that this chaperone complex plays a role in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. We found that HSP90, SGT1, and RAR1 are all required for MSL10-induced cell death in the transient tobacco expression assay, and for the hyper-accumulation of ROS, indicating that the same is true in stably transformed plants. However, we do not detect direct interactions between MSL10 and any of these components by a variety of methods.\nB. We determined that 14-3-3 proteins interact with MSL10 in a specific manner.   14-3-3 proteins are evolutionarily conserved proteins that often recognize and bind to the loose consensus sequences R/KXXS or R/KXXXS, subsequently regulating the function of their binding partners or “clients” via effects on enzyme activity, subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction, conformation, or stability. Four of the seven in vivo phosphorylated residues in the MSL10 N-terminus are part of a 14-3-3 consensus binding site. While full-length MSL10 interacts with all 14-3-3 proteins in the split-ubiquitin yeast two hybrid, the introduction of four point mutations designed to disrupt the 14-3-3 consensus sequences at S48, S57, S128, and S131 also disrupt the interaction. As is shown, MSL10K45A K53A K124A R127A interacts normally with the positive control in this assay.\nManuscripts in Preparation:\nD. Basu, K. M. Veley, J. Shoots, Matt Mixdorf and E. S. Haswell.

            "task_description": "Single-celled spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii respond within seconds to both the direction and magnitude of gravity stimuli by altering the direction and magnitude of a trans-cell Ca2+ current that is required for the gravity response. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which gravity alters the trans-cell current, and identify key signaling steps that link the current to cellular polarity changes directed by gravity. This focus on gravity signaling addresses an overarching question in the Space Biology Science Plan. Ca2+-uptake channels and Ca2+-ATPase efflux pumps drive the Ca2+ current across spore cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of genes and proteins highly expressed in spores at the peak of the Ca2+ current have identified likely candidates for the pumps and channels. Immunological approaches and yeast-based activity assays will be used to determine whether these transporters are localized on the plasma membrane and are regulated post-translationally. Recent evidence indicates that extracellular eATP [eATP], a newly discovered signaling agent, helps control the gravity response in Ceratopteris, just as it helps regulate gravitropism in Arabidopsis roots. Because eATP controls the activity of Ca2+ channels in plants, we will test the regulatory link between eATP and the activity of Ca2+ channels that is crucial for the gravity response in Ceratopteris. Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulins, annexins, and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases are highly expressed in Ceratopteris at the peak of the Ca2+ current. They are the most likely signal transducers that help mediate the downstream cell polarization events guided by gravity, and their regulatory role in the gravity response will be tested. Expected results will generate hypotheses that predict molecular responses likely to occur in Ceratopteris cells in response to the micro-g environment, and the proposal will describe International Space Station (ISS) experiments that could test these predictions.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The germinating spore of Ceratopteris is an especially valuable model system for studying the cellular bases of gravity-induced graviresponses on Earth, because both the sensing of gravity and the response occur in the same cell. The cellular level mechanisms of sensory responses are very similar in plant and animal cells, thus the bottom-to-top Ca2+ current that develops early during spore germination as one of the first polarized events induced by gravity in the cell may be an early event also in animal cells known to respond to gravity, such as muscle and bone cells. Our investigation into candidate molecules likely to be associated with both the efflux and influx phases of this current will help clarify how this current is controlled. A number of studies have documented the importance of Ca2+ currents for polarized growth in both animal and plant cells; however, there are few prior studies that have identified and analyzed the molecular components of these currents. Moreover, while it is generally accepted that Ca2+ is a second messenger that participates in a myriad of plant and animal sensory responses, there is still little known about the molecular identity of the Ca2+ channels that mediate many of these responses, especially responses to gravitational stimuli. The proposed tests of Ca2+ pump and channel function and regulation, including possibly channel regulation by eATP, will not only provide novel insights into how the gravity-directed Ca2+ current originates, but also further advance an understanding of channel structures. The results will set the stage for future assays of post-translational changes that occur during space flight in the Ca2+-ATPase pumps and/or mechanosensitive channels in fern and possibly also in some animal cells when the transporter activities go from near zero in micro-gravity to quite high as the g-force rises to 2-g or higher levels achieved during parabolic flight or on a centrifuge on the International Space Station (ISS)."

            "task_progress": "The specific aim of the novel research proposed was to discover the molecular bases of rapid gravity responses in single spore cells of the fern Ceratopteris richardii. The approach to achieve this goal was to identify from recently obtained transcriptomic data molecular components that would be likely to drive the calcium current that is rapidly modulated by gravity. This would then allow an assessment of  post-transcriptional signaling changes in these components that are both induced by gravity and needed for subsequent, gravity-directed polarity changes in cell division and growth. Prior literature suggests many of the post-transcriptional changes induced by gravity in single Ceratopteris cells are similarly induced in multi-cellular organs of flowering plants, so the findings of this project are likely to have relevance to gravitational studies in the more complex tissues of higher plants. Expected findings from the proposed studies would predict rapid molecular-level changes that will be induced in the micro-g environment, and testing the validity of these predictions in Space Flight experiments will be both feasible and likely to provide valuable new insights on the systems life uses to sense and react to gravity.\nOne of the goals of Aim 1 of the original proposal was to molecularly identify cation transporters that could play a major role in driving the trans-cell calcium current that is directed by gravity in fern spores cells. In accord with this goal, we obtained the full-length sequence of a putative MscS (mechanosensitive channel, small current) gene, and obtained evidence in support of the conclusion that it actually has Msc activity by showing that it could partially rescue a bacterial knockout of Msc.  We also obtained partial sequences of two other Msc candidates in Ceratopteris that will serve as the basis to design primers that can “walk” through the Ceratopteris transcriptome and genome to obtain their full sequences, and the primary sequences of the proteins they encode. This will enable the production of antibodies that can be used to identify where each of the Msc channels is localized. If any of these candidates prove to be mechanosensitive channels on the plasma membrane, it (or they) would be the one(s) most likely to undergo post-translational modifications by gravity stimulation.\nThe goal of Aim 2 of the original proposal was to test the role of genes encoding Ca2+-binding proteins that are expressed at the peak of the trans-cell Ca2+ current by suppressing or overexpressing their transcription using transformation methods. We have successfully generated transgenic Ceratopteris spores expressing one of several different transgenes, and these spores will be valuable tools for genetically dissecting gravity responses in spores that respond to gravity while they are still single cells. The mutants include one expressing the calcium reporter Yellow Cameleon, which will enable assessing gravity-induced changes in [Ca2+]cyt; one constitutively expressing a spore annexin, which is a calcium-binding protein implicated in regulating calcium channels in plasma membranes, one suppressed in annexin expression; one knocked down in expression of the Ca2+ATPase pump that helps drive the gravity-induced trans-cell calcium current;  and one knocked down in one of the mechanosensitive ion channels described above in the paragraph on Aim 1. Generating these mutants and genetically confirming their mutant status required over two years of ground-breaking research, and the transgenic products are the first (and still the only) fern mutants modified in spore-expressed genes.\nWe made the most progress on Aim 3 of the original proposal, which was to test the role of eATP in promoting the critical Ca2+-uptake step of the spore gravity response. Key background information that provides the rationale for this goal is that when gravity directs the polarization of Ceratopteris fern spores this process begins with the uptake of calcium through channels at the bottom of the spore, and this step is necessary for the gravity response. Data from several different laboratories showing that extracellular ATP (eATP) regulates calcium channels in plants and animals led to the hypothesis that extracellular nucleotides could play a role in the gravity-directed polarization of Ceratopteris spores. In animal and plant cells ATP can be released from mechanosensitive channels.\nThe idea that a differential distribution of a signaling molecule could lead to morphological polarity is not unique. In this regard, gradients of the growth hormone auxin are among the best documented to be inductive of cell polarity in plants. The differential distribution of eATP during gravity-directed polarization could be an early step in a series of asymmetrical molecular events that ultimately lead to the downstream cellular and morphological changes needed to generate a gravity-directed, downward growing rhizoid in Ceratopteris spores. Precedent data relevant to this hypothesis are those of Tang et al. (Wenqiang Tang, Shari R. Brady, Yu Sun, Gloria K. Muday, and Stanley J. Roux.  Extracellular ATP Inhibits Root Gravitropism at Concentrations That Inhibit Polar Auxin Transport. Plant Physiol. 2003 131: 147-154.) in the journal Plant Physiology, who showed that a high [eATP] inhibits the gravity response in Arabidopsis roots. They interpreted their data as evidence that an eATP gradient could be one of the first steps involved in the gravity response in plant cells. These data led us to test whether gravity could induce a gradient of eATP between the top and bottom of germinating fern spores, and, if so, whether this gradient could help mediate the gravity effect of directing the polarization of the spores.\nIn order to carry out this test, an ATP biosensor, developed by the McLamore laboratory at the University of Florida, was used to measure the [eATP] at the bottom and top of germinating spores during gravity-directed polarization. This biosensor could quantify eATP levels down to the low nM range, and it has a tip diameter of only 1-2 µm, much smaller than the 100-120 µm diameter of spore cells. Using this unique tool with a micromanipulator that could guide the probe to within a few microns of the spore surface, we made the exciting discovery that the [eATP] along the bottom of the spore averaged 7-fold higher than the concentration at the top. Treatments that disrupted the gradient, such as flooding the medium with ATP, or that antagonized eATP receptors, such as adding the ATP receptor blocker PPADS to the medium, or that hydrolyzed ATP in the medium, such as by the addition of phosphatase enzymes, all resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the gravity response. In order to investigate the source of ATP release, spores were treated with Brefeldin A (BFA), which would block cellular secretory activity, and gadolinium trichloride (GdCl3), which would block the transport activity of the mechanosensitive channels that release ATP into the extracellular medium. These treatments resulted in a significant decrease in gravity-directed polarization.\nThe same eATP biosensor was also used to measure ATP release after treatment with both BFA and GdCl3. Both of these treatments caused a significant decrease in [ATP] measured around spores. These results supported the hypothesis that ATP could be released from mechanosensitive channels and secretory vesicles during gravity-directed polarization.\nThe novel findings described above show a clear role for eATP in gravity-directed polarization of Ceratopteris spores by documenting that gravity can induce a bottom-to-top gradient of extracellular ATP around the spores, and that this gradient promotes gravity-directed polarization of the spores. They provide support for the hypothesis that mechanosensitive channels, which have been implicated in other reports as critical components of gravity responses, can help generate eATP gradients that can enhance a cellular gravity response. Overall, they reveal that quantifying and evaluating gradients of eATP can lead to a more thorough understanding of how plants use ATP release to direct growth and development.\nProduction of the novel self-referencing biosensor used to document the gravity-induced eATP gradient between the top and bottom of vertically-oriented spore cells would not have been possible without support from this NASA grant. Recognizing that this biosensor would be a valuable research tool for investigating other eATP-regulated phenomena not only in ferns but also in higher plants, we used it to assay [eATP] levels around growth zones of primary roots of Arabidopsis, because previous research had indicated cells release ATP as they grow. We also used the probe to evaluate whether changing the expression of two apyrase (NTPDase) enzymes (AtAPY1 and AtAPY2), which had been implicated in hydrolyzing and thus limiting the [eATP], actually altered the [eATP]. Our results, which we presented in posters at two international meetings, showed that the [eATP] is highest in root zones that have the highest growth rate (i.e., elongation zones) and that the constitutive expression of AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 lowered this concentration, whereas suppression of these apyrases raised the [eATP]. These results provided novel and important verification of previously postulated hypotheses about the relationship of eATP and apyrase enzymes to growth, and they are being assembled into a manuscript that we expect to submit this summer.",

Based on the knowledge that reduced vestibular information, increased sympathetic activation, and bone loss are common hallmarks of long-term space missions, we hypothesized that space-induced bone loss has a vestibular and sympathetic origin, and that vestibular stimulation might increase bone density.\nThe main objective of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of vestibular stimulation on bone mass, with the goal of designing a new therapeutic approach to prevent bone loss in space. The project is divided into two specific aims. The first one will define the short and long-term effects of vestibular hair cell dysfunction on the vegetative system and on bone mass in mice, in order to determine whether this effect is compensated with time.  Catecholamine levels, brown adipose tissue Ucp1/Gapdh expression, 3D-microcomputed tomography, and quantitative static and dynamic bone histomorphometry will be used. The second specific aim will characterize the effects of vestibular stimulation on the vegetative system and bone. Different centrifuge protocols (continuous and discontinuous, 1.5G/2G/2.5G) and galvanic vestibular stimulation will be used. Centrifugations will be performed in Dr. Makishma (University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), USA) and in Dr. Besnard and Prof. Denise (University of Caen, France) laboratories. Galvanic stimulation will be performed in Dr. Elefteriou's laboratory, in collaboration with Dr. Wood (Houston/UTMB, USA). All the bone analyses will be performed at Vanderbilt University (Dr. Elefteriou, Vanderbilt University). The part of the study performed in France is supported by the University of Caen Basse-Normandie and by the Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES).\nThe ultimate goal of this multi-disciplinary effort is to determine whether vestibular stimulation could have beneficial effects on bone mineral density and sympathetic function during extended space missions. These findings may have application on Earth as well for the treatment or prevention of low bone mass conditions.",

            "task_description": "A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increase susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.\nIn short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in \"Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration\" including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA (NASA Research Announcement).",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.\nUnderstanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. For example, loss of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma is a commonality abound spaceflight/disuse, aging, Type 2 diabetes, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oxidative stress appears to be at the root of nNOSµ loss in theses muscle myopathies.  Out laboratory seeks to understand the underlying redox mechanisms that leader to perturbation in nNOS function and thus myopathy."

            "task_progress": "Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that adapts rapidly to changes in mechanical loading by altering its cross-sectional area and mass. The reduced mechanical loading of spaceflight causes postural muscles in the lower extremities and flexors in the upper extremities to lose fiber cross-sectional area and force-generating capacity. Muscle atrophy and weakness may then impede mission objectives, increase the risk of injury, and increase susceptibility to damage upon reloading. Muscular alterations with spaceflight are therefore a critical limitation to performance during spaceflight missions and a serious health concern for astronauts.\nExcessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is considered an important component of muscle myopathy with unloading. ROS are produced from the mitochondria and non-phagocytic NADPH-oxidases (NOX) in skeletal muscle fibers and thought to contribute to atrophy through activation of proteolytic pathways. In addition, ROS may initiate a signaling pathway that results in disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-complex (DGC). The DGC serves as an interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix and is responsible for the detection and transmittance of load necessary for regulation of various cellular processes. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others indicates that ROS-induced atrophy is related to disruption of the DGC and translocation of the mu(µ)-splice variant of nNOS from the sarcolemma into the cytosol. nNOSµ is then thought to directly stimulate FoxO3a and ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1, atrogin-1), leading to muscle fiber atrophy.\nThe purpose of this investigation is to identify oxidant-related mechanisms that lead to disruption of the DGC, translocation nNOSµ, proteolysis, and thus atrophy. Our central hypothesis is that ROS, produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria, cause translocation of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis and suppressing protein synthesis. Our experimental design consists of a series of studies utilizing a rodent hindlimb unloading model of spaceflight to: (1) identify NOX dependent signaling of nNOS translocation, FoxO3a activation, and muscle fiber atrophy, and (2) determine the redox regulatory role in DGC disruption with mechanical unloading and atrophy. In addition, additional investigation has been commenced to better translate these findings to spaceflight, where we have begun to use pharmaceutical (Losartan) and nutraceutical (fish oil + curcumin) interventions to limit unloading-induced atrophy.\nData that has been collected thus far indicates that: (1) administration of a potent antioxidant, the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134, prevents unloading induced atrophy during a short-term (54  hr) unloading protocol. Reduced atrophy was related to decreased expression of NOX subunits, ROS production, and markers of ROS-related signaling/damage. In addition, nNOS translocation was prevented with EUK-134 administration as well as related activation of proteolysis through FoxO3a dephosphorylation; (2) EUK-134 also prevented unloading induced atrophy during a longer 7-day unloading protocol, an effect also related to decreased ROS production and nNOS translocation as well as activation of anabolic pathways; (3) More specific targeting of ROS production by using a NOX-2 inhibitor, gp91 ds-tat, and mitochondrial ROS inhibitor, SS-31, has also resulted in reduced muscle fiber atrophy following a 7-day unloading protocol. Interestingly, an interaction between these two sources of ROS has also been suggested with our pilot data; and lastly, (4) pharmaceutical inhibition of angiotensin II receptor I (AT1R), and (5) a nutraceutical interventions with fish oil + curcumin, respectively, have demonstrated similar results.\nIn summary, inhibition of ROS appears to be effective in limiting skeletal muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading. Inhibition of ROS is related to augmented anabolic and reduced catabolic signaling as well as translocation of nNOS, and the source of ROS production may be from both the mitochondria and Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase. Future studies will focus on finalizing the 7-day EUK-134 interventional study including measurement of fractional synthesis rate; further delineating the mechanisms responsible for reduced atrophy with peptidyl inhibition of ROS using gp91ds-tat to target Nox2 and SS-31 to target mitochondria. We will also utilize a genetic ablation of Nox2 (gp91phox-/-) to further establish its role in unloading induced atrophy; and establishing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical interventions in preventing unloading-induced atrophy. In addition, fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and rate of protein degradation will be assessed in future experiments.",

            "task_description": "Gene expression during cellular differentiation is precisely choreographed. Its timing and location controls cell fate; early occurring mistakes are readily amplified during cell division, resulting in birth defects, disease, or death. Epigenetic marks constitute chemical modifications that are added ‘on top of’ DNA that direct gene expression (turn genes ON/OFF) without causing a genetic mutation. These marks include DNA methylation (the 5-methylcytosine, 5mC), and hydroxymethylation (the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5hmC) and histone tail modifications (methylation, acetylation, etc). These heritable, yet reversible instructions are affected by many environmental factors, including diet, stress, alcohol, radiation, environmental contaminants, and cell culture conditions. In space “the final frontier”, organisms are exposed to powerful environmental forces (microgravity, cosmic radiation, magnetic fields) that potentially govern epigenetic gene regulation. These alter cell fate by modulating the epigenome leading to changes in gene expression. While a majority of the existing work describes the 5mC and histone modification landscapes in Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), limited data exist on epigenetic programming in embryoid bodies and only a handful of studies have documented the 5hmeC landscape in pluripotent ESCs. Furthermore, the effects of space flight on 5meC, 5hmeC, and histone modifications remain unexplored. However, preliminary studies suggest that space flight inhibits differentiation of mouse ESCs, arguing that these environmental forces negatively impact epigenetic programming, leading to sustained ESC pluripotency. In this study, we investigate the effects of simulated microgravity on 5mC and 5hmC patterns in the genome. To our knowledge, this study is the first to document the effects of simulated microgravity on epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The following methods were developed to complete the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments for the two cell lines.\nBy elucidating the mechanisms that govern epigenetic programming and gene regulation in single cells, we will provide fundamental knowledge that will broadly impact the epigenetics community, basic biology, and NASA’s space biology programs. The goal of our interdisciplinary effort is to develop an integrated approach comprised of Next Generation Sequencing and single cell microscopy platforms to understand how the space environment affects DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation, and histone modifications to regulate gene expression during differentiation using an Embryonic Stem Cell model. The two key aims of the grant were:\nAim 1. Determine the effects of simulated microgravity on epigenetic modifications and gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells.\nAim 2. Correlate DNA methylation (5mC and 5hmC) and histone modifications in single cells at specified loci with gene expression and ESC differentiation following exposure to the space flight environment.\nBased on the reviewers' comments Aim 1 was modified to demonstrate proof-of-concept for the initial Phase funding to test the hypothesis that microgravity in fact alters DNA methylation.   Revised Aim 1. Determine the effects of space flight on epigenetic modifications and gene expression in HL-60 and TK6 cells. We hypothesize that microgravity and other environmental conditions during space flight alter DNA methylation, leading to changes in the expression of specific genes that are impacted by this unique environment. We will assess 5hmeC and 5meC using next generation sequencing and correlate these epigenetic marks with the expression of five key genes sensitive to ground conditions (static and rotary cultures) and space flight environment.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Our study will constitute one of the first efforts to assess how environmental conditions (i.e., microgravity, radiation) affect epigenetic patterns (i.e., DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns and histone modifications) to coordinate gene expression. We expect these epigenetic events to explain genetic aberrations that cannot be explained by conventional genetic studies. Discovery of site-specific alteration of the epigenome and its role in gene expression will be highly significant not only to the field of epigenetics, but to biology in general. By elucidating epigenetic consequences due to the space flight environment in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their differentiated counterparts, embryoid bodies, we will begin to discover mechanistically how gravity alters epigenetic modifications and in turn, gene expression in the three basic germlayers (endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm) during cellular differentiation. Our ability to complement genomic sequencing with single cell tools will facilitate exploration of any gene at single cell resolution from any organism, a heretofore, elusive feature. With slight modifications, we will have the ability to assess DNA binding factors, reveal functional irregularities based on epigenetic profiles, and screen for drugs that target specific enzymes that add or remove epigenetic modifications. Our methodologies can also be used to follow chromatin through the cell cycle and to determine how DNA damage triggers changes in chromatin. Key applications also include defining real-time chromatin dynamics during cellular growth, differentiation, and early development not only in response to space flight but also diet, nutrition, and alcohol, among other environmental factors. We expect our contributions to impact space biology research in NASA, and the planning of future long-term space flight expeditions."

            "task_description": "The spaceflight environment influences immune cell distribution, ex vivo responses to antigen, and cytokine expression. However, few studies have characterized the impact of the spaceflight environment on the host immune response following an in vivo immune challenge, particularly those involving B cells and antibody production. The International Space Station (ISS) provides an ideal laboratory within which investigators can explore this unique environment and its impact on the host response. Through the use of a mouse model (with an immune system that closely parallels that of humans), we will establish a link between exposure to the spaceflight environment and decrements in immune system activation. This study is significant because it will directly test the hypothesis that host immunological health will be compromised in space.\nOn-orbit Flight Activities, Procedures, and Timeline\nMice will receive health checks upon unloading and transfer from the Transporter to the Habitat after capsule docking no later than 24 hrs after hatch opening. Animal health will then be monitored daily via continuous video recording from one camera at a time from all of the Habitats on-orbit (including other investigations which may be running concurrently) and down-linked to Ames science staff. Ground personnel shall have the option of programming or manually controlling which camera is being down-linked and recorded at any given time. Water levels will be checked every 3-4 days. After a minimum of 14 days after animal transfer from the Transporter to the Habitat, all 20 mice will be moved to the MSG and receive intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle (5 mice), Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine (5 mice), CpG ODN adjuvant (5 mice), or TT vaccine + CpG ODN adjuvant (5 mice). The dose of TT and/or CpG ODN will be 10 microg/ mouse and 40 microg/ mouse, respectively.  Pre-mixed doses will be prepared preflight in 100 microl saline and stored at -20 to -30°C until the appropriate time point. All injections and blood draws will use a 1 mL 26G 3/8” tuberculin syringe.  All injections will be i.p.\nBefore use, the CpG adjuvant must be stored at -20°C or colder until use and the TT vaccine must be stored at 4°C. At 14 +/- 2 days after injection, mice will be transferred to the MSG and sacrificed via an i.p. injection of 100/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine mixture, followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately following the blood collection, the spleens from the mice will be removed, sectioned into halves, and placed in a frozen environment (minimum temperature -80°C) until returned to Earth. Following spleen collection, the remains of the mouse carcass will be wrapped in tin foil, put in a zip-lock bags and placed in a -80°C environment (or colder) to preserve the tissues for future biospecimen sharing. Blood must not be allowed to sit at ambient temperature for longer than 1 hour post-collection; if operational requirements require the blood collected to be stored in excess of 1 hour before centrifugation, the blood must be transferred to a 4°C environment until centrifugation, for a period not to exceed 4 hours. Blood collected will be separated into solid and serum/plasma fractions by centrifugation and frozen at -80°C until returned to Earth. Storage times for both spleen and blood of up to 6 months at -80°C are acceptable.\nTime\nActivity &\nEstimated Time Required\nThermal Req.\nComments, Location &\nSpecial Considerations\nLaunch to L + 45 days\nAnimal health checks via video monitoring; water    level checks every 3-4 days\n20 – 30°C\nVideo downlink required for health checks\nTransfer to Habitat + 14 d\nAll 20 mice will be transferred to habitat\n20 – 30°C\nRequires transfer to and from Habitat with MTB;\nInjection + 14d +/- 2 d\nAt specific time points, all 20 mice will be    removed from AEM and given appropriate injection\n20 – 30°C / -80°C\nRequired transfer to MSG for injections\nDissection + 0 d\nMice euthanized, blood drawn and centrifuged and    spleen sectioned and frozen.

Habitats will be kept at a regular 12hr:12hr day:night light cycle to match the day/night programmed to be synchronous with the crew’s day/night cycle upon arrival. Water refill of habitats shall be performed. To prevent rodent food bars from becoming too hard or soiled, they will be replaced with a fresh food bar plate (from 4°C storage) at a time to not exceed 30 days after the introduction of mice to a Habitat.\nGround Activities Accompanying On-orbit Activities and Timeline\nGround controls will be run following spaceflight environmental parameters in orbital environmental simulator(s) (OES) chambers at KSC ACF. Delay between launch and start of environmental controls may be up to 8 days, depending on the logistics and capability of the telemetry system. Mice will be housed in flight Habitats with RFB diet and lixit water to match on-orbit groups. The operations done on ground will be conducted to match the same relative time points during the day/night cycle of the animals on-orbit, so that procedures on ground control mice are conducted at the same points in the animals’ circadian rhythm.\nEach experimental group for ground controls will be doubled to improve the statistical significance of the experiment with a total of 40 mice (4 groups of 10). Therefore, 2 Transporters will be required for the flight in orbital environmental simulator(s) (OES) that have been programmed with telemetry data from the flight. At the same relative time point (accounting for delay in starting ground controls after flight) the mice are transferred from the Transporter to the Habitat, the 40 ground control mice will be transferred from the 2 Transporters into 4 Habitats, and maintained in OES programmed with telemetry data from the ISS. OES shall be programmed to mimic the following conditions experienced by the Transport and then the Habitat: CO2, O2, temperature, and humidity.\nInjection and dissection must be performed as close as possible to how they are done on-orbit. In particular, the time of day that mice are sacrificed and dissected on the ground should match the same point in the circadian rhythms of the mice on-orbit. However, dissections or ground control mice can be conducted on standard laboratory benches/tables with chairs that are more ergonomic to the operators. For ground controls, dissection pins or needles may be used to pin down mice for dissection, as can spray bottles of wetting the mice before dissection. Flight hardware is required when it may affect the tissue dissection or preservation, such as having flight cold blocks in mini cold bags for tissue freezing.\nMice will receive health checks daily via video in the Habitat and water levels will be checked every 3-4 days. After a minimum of 14 days in the OES, all 40 mice will receive an i.p. injection of vehicle (10 mice), TT vaccine (10 mice), CpG adjuvant (10 mice), or TT vaccine + CpG adjuvant (10 mice). At 14 +/- 2 days after injection, mice will be sacrificed via an i.p. injection of 100/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine mixture, followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately following the blood collection, the spleens from the mice will be removed, sectioned into halves, and placed in a frozen environment (minimum temperature -80°C) until returned to Earth. Duration for which blood is stored at ambient or 4°C shall be matched as closely as possible to the timelines the same procedures will be performed on-orbit. Blood collected will be separated into solid and serum/plasma fractions by centrifugation and frozen at -80°C until returned to the laboratory of the PI.

            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "According to the National Institute of Aging (NIA), “Life expectancy nearly doubled during the 20th century with a ten-fold increase in the number of Americans age 65 or older.”  Furthermore, “there are approximately 35 million Americans age 65 or older, and this number is expected to double in the next 25 years.” Consequently, there is a rapidly growing need to understand the mechanisms underlying age-associated illness. Indeed, in the last decade, research has repeatedly demonstrated an impact of aging on immune function. Low-grade increases in circulating inflammatory cytokine secretion are often associated with senescence. Furthermore, studies suggest that these disruptions are likely due to decrements in cellular repair mechanisms and/or increases in antigenic load. Given this disruption in immune function, it is perhaps not surprising that many of the diseases associated with aging — such as type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease — have strong inflammatory underpinnings.\nThere are strong indications that the physiological effects of spaceflight are also similar to those seen in senescence. For instance, evidence suggests that age-associated enhancements in inflammatory cytokines are linked to changes in adipose tissue and energy balance. Similar links between metabolism, adipose tissue, and inflammation have also been shown to manifest in astronauts and animal models after exposure to spaceflight.  We propose to use long-term exposure to the spaceflight environment to model the effects of aging on immune function. Although these initial studies involve mice, the next obvious step in this work will be to work directly with astronauts.  Because astronauts tend to be extremely healthy, these effects will not be influenced by confounding factors such as clinically relevant, age-related disease. Also, because the effects of spaceflight on immunity are temporary, generally returning to baseline levels post-flight, this will ultimately give us some insight into whether or not the effects of aging are, indeed, reversible.\nAlthough many different aspects of immune function are influenced by both aging and spaceflight, these experiments will focus on B cells and the generation of antibodies.  Specifically, we will use next generation RNA sequencing techniques to characterize the B cell Ig heavy chain in animals that are challenged with tetanus toxoid.  The Ig heavy chain is the component of antibodies responsible for identifying specific sections of the tetanus toxoid, thereby coordinating subsequent immune responses.  Comparisons will be made between the B cell repertoires generated on ISS and on Earth.  The changes in B cell Ig heavy chain usage will provide indications whether the spaceflight environment affects the B cells that respond to antigen.  This, in turn, will help us understand the impact of aging on B cell function.\nWe anticipate that we will obtain several data sets which have relevance to spaceflight and/or have general significance to understanding host immune responsiveness.  These data include:   1)\tData that show that spaceflight either maintains or alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts;     2)\tInformation that demonstrates how immunization with an immunogen, commonly used in human medicine, alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts in the absence of the spaceflight variable;    3)\tDeterminations how activation of B cells through Tlr9 receptors alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts.\nWe will ascertain if activation of B cells through Tlr9 receptors can reverse any impact that may occur during spaceflight."

            "task_progress": "Project History and Review of Specific Aims\nThis project was submitted and funded in response to the NASA Research Announcement NNH12ZTT001N: Research Opportunities in Space Biology. This multidisciplinary project was to include three independent investigators and two institutions (Loma Linda University/LLU and Kansas State University/KSU, in addition to NASA). Since then, due to a series of unpredictable events, this project has evolved to include a number of ground-based analog studies, multiple analyses of flight tissues, and an actual flight study. We designated this experiment as Tetanus Antibody Response from B-cells In Space (TARBIS).\nThe original project involved three different experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to characterize different aspects of the antibody response. We proposed to immunize mice with the established tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine. This would allow us to generate an antigen-specific antibody response in our mouse model while using a clinically-relevant antigen. Our goal was to determine the impact of the spaceflight environment on primary and secondary antibody responses. C57BL/6J mice were challenged with a TT vaccine either before launch or during their stay on the ISS, as appropriate. Blood and spleen were to be collected in orbit from mice 2 weeks after primary or secondary immunization. Vaccination and assessment schedules would have been matched in ground-based controls. The antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatment groups.\nDue to the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and a greater-than 2-year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved in 2015 to modify the aims of NNX13AN34G to include a Flight Definition Phase. Much of the work between 2015 and 2018 involved completing the Flight Definition phase work and publishing the results. In 2017-2018, we requested a funding augmentation and began preparations for our spaceflight mission. As this process evolved, two of our originally proposed experiments were combined into one flight experiment. During this period a Co-Investigator, Dr. Keith Chapes, announced that he would be retiring from KSU. With his retirement, all experimental operations were moved to LLU. Previously, this work was completed at KSU in Dr. Chapes’ lab. Dr. Chapes continued his role as a Co-I as an independent consultant. In 2019, this experiment flew as TARBIS/Rodent Research-12. In the years between 2019 and the present, we were involved with a number of other flight-related opportunities, including several Biospecimen Sharing Program dissections and RR-18.  Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted and delayed multiple activities during this period.     Flight Definition Phase Work\n1. Analysis of spleen tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research - 1 (RR-1) verification flight.\nWe analyzed spleen RNA from these tissues (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 ground controls). We have determined IgH usage of the spleen B cells in these mice (flight vs. ground controls). We also generated total RNASeq on the RNA to have a matching data set to the liver RNASeq that is being done by the NASA GeneLab.\nWe analyzed GeneLab sequencing data that was available from the GeneLab database (GLDS-47, GLDS-48). The number of immunoglobulin reads (either heavy or light chain) were quite low, less than 1% of what we had obtained in preliminary analysis of spleen cells and tissue. We first attributed this low yield to short sequencing reads from the HiSeq sequencing method that Genelab did and provided in the database. Therefore, we sequenced both splenic (funded by another grant) and liver RNA from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) validation flight, which was made available by the NASA Ames Research Center (n=3 ground, n=3 flight). RNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (300bp, 2x) at the Kansas State Integrated Genomics Facility. Sequencing data was quality trimmed using CLC Genomics Workbench and mapped to reference libraries obtained from the  ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database. Data sets were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for Complementarity Determining Region 3 (CDR3) characterization.\nThe analysis of liver (quantified as part of the tissue sharing grant, NNX15AB45G) vs. spleen (quantified as part of THIS grant) reads indicated that liver immunoglobulin gene reads range from 0.26% of spleen immunoglobulin gene reads to 0.91%. The number of reads ranges from less than 100 to no greater than 622, depending on the sample. Although useful, publishable data from the spleen can be obtained (preliminary data presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) and presented in the GeneLab workshop by Chapes and Ward), the liver sequencing will not provide meaningful immunoglobulin gene data, even when the more comprehensive MiSeq next generation sequencing (NGS) platform is used to sequence. The liver data won’t be of any value and will not fulfill our goal of doing tissue comparisons. Other data from the MiSeq NGS data sets will be useful for other data mining attempts and will be made available to the GeneLab. Therefore, these sequencing runs allowed us to narrow our focus and not waste time on liver analyses. [Ed. Note: For information on the tissue sharing grant, see NASA Grant # NNX15AB45G; PI: Chapes.

An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight.\nIn this protocol, mice were subjected to AOS. Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways: phosphate buffer saline (PBS), unmethylated cytosine–guanine dinucleotide motifs (CpG), tetanus toxoid (TT), and TT with CpG. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we sacrificed the mice and collected a variety of tissues for further analysis. These are the same treatment groups that were proposed for our ISS studies. We used female C57BL/6J mice, 10-12 weeks old at the start of unloading. Independent variables were Tetanus Toxoid, CpG adjuvant, and hindlimb unloading. Blood and spleen were analyzed as part of this grant (NNX13AN34G). Assays at Loma Linda University included blood, TT specific IgG, IgA, IgM, and non-specific Ig levels. Kansas State University completed analyzing the IgH & IgK repertoire based on RNAseq.\nThe AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during spaceflight (Chapes, Mastro et al. 1993). [Ed. Note: See References.] Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 (5 mice per treatment group); Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 (5 mice per treatment group). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS. Two weeks later, the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways: PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG. Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we sacrificed the mice and collected a variety of tissues. This protocol was followed so that when mice were flown to the ISS, we would have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables. Serum, spleen, liver, and bone marrow were collected specifically to compare with our flight project.\nBriefly, we were able to confirm that i.p. injections – as opposed to the more typical intramuscular (i.m.) injection for vaccines – of TT resulted in an antibody response and that this response was augmented by an order of magnitude when mice were also given the CpG adjuvant. However, AOS had little impact on the ability to generate TT-specific antibodies, at least in the blood. AOS increased circulating corticosterone levels and a number of cytokines/chemokines, including GCSF, IL-1a, IL-5, IL-6, IP-10, and KC.\nImpact of AOS on the Spleen Ig Repertoire\nWe explored the impact of skeletal unloading using the AOS model and mice were experimentally challenged with TT and/or the adjuvant CpG. AOS did alter constant gene usage, resulting in higher levels of IgM and lower levels of IgG. CpG also altered constant gene region usage, increasing usage of IgA. Significant changes could be detected in multiple V-, D-, and J-gene segments in both the heavy and light chains in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatments. Analysis of class-switched-only transcripts revealed a different pattern of V-gene segment usage than detected in the whole repertoire and also showed significant alterations in gene segment usage after challenge. Alterations in V/J pairing were also detected in response to challenge. CDR3 amino acid sequence overlaps were similar among treatment groups, though the addition of CpG lowered overlap in the heavy chain. We isolated 3,045 whole repertoire and 98 potentially TT-specific CDR3 sequences for the heavy chain and 569 for the light chain. Our results demonstrate that AOS alters the repertoire response to challenge with TT and/or CpG.\nImpact of AOS on the Bone Marrow Ig Repertoire\nIn the same AOS experiment, the bone marrow antibody repertoire was characterized – including V-, D- (heavy only), and J-gene segment usage, constant region usage, CDR3 length, and V(D)J combinations. We detected changes in gene-segment usage in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatment in both the heavy and light chains of bone marrow B cells. Additionally, changes were seen in the class-switched VH-gene repertoire. Alterations were also detected in V/J pairing for both the heavy and light chains, and changes CDR3 length. We also detected lower levels of CDR3 AA overlap than detected in the splenic repertoire. These results demonstrate that AOS, TT, and CpG alter the bone marrow antibody repertoire; however, it is still unclear from both the spleen and the bone marrow data whether there is a loss of host antigen-specific responsiveness because of the change in gene use.\nMiSeq analysis of the spleen was completed at KSU. Originally, we had intended to perform a similar analysis of the liver. However, as described above, this analysis was ineffective and we opted to analyze bone marrow instead. In addition, we characterized changes in circulating corticosterone and found that AOS led to a significant increase. Furthermore, we noted a trend for the AOS response to be augmented in TT treated mice.\nAlthough the tissue analyses were slightly different from those described in the original proposal, the aim of doing multiple tissue assessments/comparisons was accomplished. This is a high-science return. We also believe that results from these studies will augment the data from the flight experiments, confirming the efficacy of AOS as a model for spaceflight for immune endpoints.\n3. NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Anti-orthostatic Suspension Experiment in Collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Blaber.\nDue to the nature of the studies described above, we were unable to use the blood or spleen tissue collected in the LLU experiments described above to characterize the impact of unloading on WBC populations. Furthermore, the funding and flight requirements for our flight project did not allow us to compare male vs. female mice. Fortuitously, the opportunity arose to look at blood populations in a study with a design similar to our own. This project involved Elizabeth Blaber, Ph.D. at Ames Research Center. [Ed. Note: See Space Biology projects under PI: Blaber in the NASA Task Book.]\nThe focus of Dr. Blaber’s study was to study the impact of p21 on bone, muscle, and stem cells. Male and female mice were suspended for 15 or 30 days (the latter timepoint is very similar to the 28 day unloading in our AOS studies). At the appropriate timepoint, mice were sacrificed and tissues were collected immediately. We characterized blood populations using an ABC Vet automatic hematology analyzer. In addition, we collected adrenals, brain, cerebellum, eye, liver, and skin tissue and froze them in liquid nitrogen. Although we were primarily interested in the wild type controls for this study, we collected tissues from both wild type controls and the p21 knockout mice.\nOur analyses of the blood indicated that unloading decreased all of the major leukocyte population counts. This decrease was generally more pronounced in the lymphocyte subset than in the other populations. Female mice tended to have higher cell counts than males, but there was no significant unloading x sex interaction on any subset. Finally, counts were similar between wild-type controls and p21 knockouts for all populations.\n4. Tetanus Toxoid Validation Test\nIn 2018, we were told that our flight experiment would be the focus of Rodent Research - 12 (RR-12). Because our initial assessment of the tetanus toxoid was several years old, we ran a small verification test on a new lot of the toxoid to ensure that biological activity of the vaccine would be as expected during the launch. This dose response study focused around the dose optimized in previous tests. Endpoints include TT-specific IgG levels. This experiment was performed in March of 2019. While we were able to verify that the same dose of TT could be use with in RR-12, we found that the CpG adjuvant was not as effective as in previous experiments.  As a consequence, we were approved to double the CpG dose as part of the flight experiment.\n5.  An Analysis of the Effects of Spaceflight and Vaccination on Antibody Repertoire Diversity\nAs part of this project, our group had the opportunity to examine the antibody repertories in C57Bl/6 mice after a number of different situations. These data allowed us a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that antibody diversity can be altered by physiological adaptation. That is, spaceflight, simulated spaceflight and/or immune responses are disruptions in stable environment and affect antibody diversity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed antibody diversity, as expressed by CDR3 amino acids, in four experiments and five data sets we have generated, using analyses frequently used to assess communities in ecological contexts; specifically, the Shannon Index (SI), an established measure of diversity. We discovered a trend towards lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in SI between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the antibody repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.\n6.  A Comparison of Unamplified and Massively Multiplexed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification for Murine Antibody Repertoire Sequencing\nWe started this project with the hypothesis that an unamplified Immunoglobulin gene data set would provide comparable results to those seen in the commercially amplified data sets. However, there were no immunoglobulin repertoire studies done to compare data obtained using amplification techniques compared to the repertoire in a total RNASeq library. Concurrent with performing these analyses, we discovered that the required sample preparation for commercial sequencing also varied. Therefore, we found it necessary to examine the impact of sample preparation as part of our effort. This preflight verification work compared a data set generated using unamplified total RNA (TRNA) to commercially amplified data sets. We examined the role of commercial amplification and cDNA generation methods, as well as the impact of the starting material on sequence output.  We found that sequencing of unamplified splenic RNA provides a realistic snapshot of the total splenic B cell repertoire. We also demonstrated that a good understanding of the bioinformatics workflow and reporting of the methodology is critical and cannot be understated. We established that there are cellular biases and transcript stability differences within B cell subpopulations. However, for the purpose of assessing a whole tissue B cell repertoire, unamplified RNASeq was capable of providing a valuable glimpse of the most prevalent B cell clones. Most importantly, an unamplified data set may detect V-gene segments that amplified data sets miss.\nFlight Activities\nOur flight investigation was launched on NG-11 out of NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility (Wallops) on 4/17/19. At the request of NASA, this flight experiment combined experiments 1 and 2 of our original proposal, including: 1) a primary challenge in space, and 2) a primary challenge pre-flight + a secondary challenge in space. Members of our team participated in the baseline, environmental control, and vivarium control vaccinations and tissue collection at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). All of these events were on a 3-4 day delay after similar procedures were performed by the ISS astronauts. Collected tissues for ground controls were frozen and shipped to LLU and stored in our freezers at -80°C. A subset of the flight blood and spleen samples were returned from the ISS and shipped to LLU to our lab in August 2019. The remaining samples and frozen carcasses of our flight mice were returned and shipped to LLU in January 2020.\nWe performed a tetanus toxoid specific IgG/IgA/IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on the blood samples from this study. There were some issues with the samples brought back from the ISS. Specifically, there was significant lysing of the red blood cells (RBCs) and we were unable to separate the cells from the plasma in roughly half of the cells. However, despite these difficulties, we were able to detect Ig in the appropriate samples.\nThe data suggest that both the CpG adjuvant and a secondary inoculation with the vaccine increased the antibody responses as expected on the ground. The difference in scale for the primary vs. secondary response figures indicates that under normal circumstances, B cell memory developed and responded as expected. However, both the primary and secondary responses were drastically inhibited after flight. There are several possible reasons for this. Decreases in the efficacy of 1) the adjuvant, 2) antigen presentation, 3) B cell memory development after the primary injection, or 4) overall cell death in B cell counts are all possibilities. The approval of our last flight experiment (where both the primary and secondary inoculations occur in orbit) is crucial to help identify the actual mechanism.\nSummary of Work: 2020 - 2021\nCOVID-19 Related Delays\nLoma Linda University went on COVID-related lockdown in March 2020. At that time, all staff were strongly encouraged to work from home if possible. Much of the work associated with this grant involved tissue processing and data analysis. While the data analysis could continue (we were able to get permission for our postdoc to connect remotely to our server), the tissue processing was put on hold. This coincided with a shutdown at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for both COVID-related issues and a temporary university-wide power failure that halted processing for several weeks.\nDue to the uncertainty related to COVID, both of our postdocs (Drs. Trisha Rettig and John Tan) opted to move on to other positions. Dr. Rettig left for a position in industry on 10/5/2020. Dr. Tan moved on to a faculty position within LLU on 6/30/2020. Similarly, our research technician, Nina Nishiyama, moved on to go to graduate school at the University of North Carolina on July 17, 2020.\nSummary of Work 2021 - 2023\nPersonnel Changes\nIn 2021, we requested an augmentation to continue the work on this project due to a variety of COVID-related delays and personnel changes. As part of this request, we included salary for half of a technician, a postdoc and a grad student. The funding was approved and the revised cooperative agreement was signed in December of 2021. For well over a year, we were unable to identify a grad student and post-doc to continue working on this project. This was likely due to 1) the difficulties associated with COVID, 2) the national downturn in grad school applications, and 3) the timing for the additional funding (i.e., in the middle of Loma Linda University’s academic year). We were finally able to identify both a grad student and post-doc at the end of 2022.  However, shortly thereafter, our grad student had to take a prolonged leave of absence due to health-related issues.  He returned to work in the summer of 2023.\nChanges in Antibody Repertoire Analysis\nAfter several delays and mishaps beyond our control, we had to make a change in our analysis, switching our antibody repertoire analysis away from the facility at Kansas State University and going with the company iRepertoire. For the first 4-5 months of 2022, we dealt with supply chain related delays trying to get the samples checked and prepped to send. We were finally able to send these tissues out to begin processing in the summer of 2022.\nTissue Collection with BSP\nFor about three weeks in October of 2021, personnel from the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at NASA  Ames Research Center (Ames) traveled to Loma Linda University to help with the tissue collection from the RR-12/TARBIS mice (frozen in orbit at the time of the mission). This was originally supposed to happen back in 2019 but was delayed considerably for a variety of reasons, including COVID-related facility shutdowns. These tissues were either shipped to Ames and added to the BSP tissue archives or shipped to co-investigators for analysis.\nAdditional Opportunities in Collaboration with Dr. Xiao Wen “Vivian” Mao\nIn January-February of 2022, several members of the TARBIS team joined Dr. Xiao Wen Mao in support of her RR-18 Live Animal Return (LAR) tissue collection at the Roskamp Institute in Florida (NASA Grant #NNX15AB41G). Although Dr. Pecaut is a Co-investigator on Dr. Mao’s grant, he also collected additional tissues as part of the BSP (specifically, spleen). Because our RR-12/TARBIS tissues were collected and frozen in orbit, we were not able to perform any functional assays or flow cytometry-based phenotype analysis. Fortunately, Dr. Mao’s flight parameters were very similar to one of our RR-12 flight experiments (i.e., ~ 4 week flight time). Therefore, we used this opportunity to do phenotyping and cytokine expression to complement our antibody analysis from our previous flight. This also complements our ground-based centrifuge study (\"Spaceflight Impacts the Microbiome-Brain Axis\" or “SIMBA”, NASA Grant #: 80NSSC19K1038) which was also for 4 weeks. This analysis is ongoing.\nIn April-May of 2022, Dr. Mao’s second RR-18 dissection occurred. This study was designed to look at the recovery responses 2-3 months after landing. Although we do not have RR-12/TARBS data that would directly correspond with this recovery period, we felt knowing the phenotype distribution and cytokine responses would inform us of the long-term consequences of spaceflight on populations critical to the antibody response.\nCurrent Status\nThroughout the final months of this project, both our post-doc and graduate student have been working on analyzing the data generated by iRepertoire.  This analysis is ongoing even though the funds for this project have ceased.\nREFERENCES\nChapes SK, Mastro AM, Sonnenfeld G, Berry WD.

            "task_description": "The detrimental effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system are well known.  It is believed that these effects may lead to clinically significant risks to astronauts on long duration space missions as well as to the success of these missions themselves.  Current studies are limited primarily to human studies and rodent experiments.  However, these model systems and human studies have significant limitations that may be addressed by using the well-established Drosophila model.  Drosophila have previously been successfully launched into space and a ground-based Drosophila model for cardiac disease and function has been developed. However, the genetically versatile Drosophila model has yet to be used for studying the effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system.\nWe flew 4 genotypes of Drosophila aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for approximately 30 days, along with identical 1-g ground controls.  The Drosophila required minimal astronaut intervention, primarily transfer to an incubator and stowage within the ISS.  The samples will be retrieved post-flight and analyzed using established methods.  Heart function, including measurements of diastolic and systolic intervals, heart rate, heart diameters, contractility, and arrhythmias was recorded.  Microscopic and immuno-histochemical evaluations of heart morphology was carried out.  Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by RNA Sequencing (RNA Seq) was conducted on both heart and brain tissue.\nThe ultimate goal of this research was to obtain data on heart muscle function in low gravity while validating the Drosophila model for studying the effects of spaceflight on cardiac disease and function. Our studies identified disruption in metabolic gene expression and a dramatic increase in proteasome gene expression. This was confirmed in a subsequent flight with immuno-histochemical analyses. The increased proteasome numbers correlated with an increase in amyloid-like protein aggregations within the heart tissue and with increased myofibrillar disarray. We also documented a decrease in collagen fibers associated with the sarcomere Z-lines within myocardial cells.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Information about cardiac muscle function in microgravity is expected to provide insights on genetic and molecular changes that occur with muscle atrophy on Earth. For example, we identified an increase in misfolded muscle protein associated with aggregated proteasomes in the heart muscle cells.  Similar alterations in protein processing may underlie the muscle atrophy that occurs during prolonged bed rest or muscle disuse in muscular dystrophies."

            "task_progress": "Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low-Earth orbit, the Moon, and beyond. Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit reduced climbing ability, cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling, and diminished cardiac output. Analysis of gene expression in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric / extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and increased expression of genes encoding proteasome subunits (cellular garbage disposals).        We further examined the role of proteasomes and protein misfolding on a second flight. We sent flies expressing fluorescently labeled proteins that we could monitor when returned to Earth for misfolding (as protein plaques). We were also able to use staining techniques to monitor proteasome numbers. We observed dramatic increases in protein plaque number and size in flies exposed to micro g and these were co-localized with large proteasome aggregates. Remarkably, in long-QT causing seizure (sei) / human ether-a-go-go (hERG) mutants, proteasomal gene expression was already lower than wildtype at 1g , but under micro g we still observed an increase compared to the 1g ground controls. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.       Our experiments validated the use of Vented Fly Boxes (VFBs) for fly experiments that require minimal space and astronaut input yet provide significant insights into organismal function under low gravity. One unexpected outcome from our second flight was excessive fungal contamination of samples stored in the Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) incubator. This information should assist future experiments that use this equipment to ensure that the experiments are not compromised by external contaminants. Nevertheless, the inclusion of fly boxes that were maintained as backup for the original flight permitted us to complete our analyses. The complete gene expression dataset is available on NASA's GeneLab database. Although not part of our original proposal we also developed an assay to measure both gene and protein expression from the same tissue source (brain) from the flies. Our analyses suggest that there are fundamental changes in proteins in metabolic pathways, circadian rhythm signaling, and the visual system that occur in micro g.  This dataset is also available on GeneLab.",

The central objective of this study is to determine what proteins are deferentially expressed during space flight in developing Arabidopsis seedlings.  A body of research has evaluated the differential gene expression on space flight vs ground controls, but gene expression provides an indirect measure of what proteins are expressed.  Genes may be transcribed but the transcripts degraded, or translated proteins may be regulated through post translational modifications.  We used BRIC-PDFU (Biological Research In Canisters - Petri Dish Fixation Unit) hardware on a Rapid Turn-Around Space Flight Experiment to gain insights into differences in protein profiles between Arabidopsis seedlings grown during space flight and ground based controls.  Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated, grown, and tissues fixed on orbit.  Once returned to Earth, total protein was extracted, labeled with iTRAQ reagents, and analyzed for differences in protein profiles, both expression levels and post translational modifications.  These data complement the gene expression data currently available from space flight experiments and also provide novel insights into differences in post-transcriptional regulation.    They have also provided a foundation for a network analysis to generate additional hypotheses as to the mechanisms involved in gravity perception/response in plants.",

Just to reiterate, roughly 20,000 Arabidopsis Wild Type (WT) Col-0 seeds were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) using PDFU-BRIC hardware. After approximately 3 days, seedlings were fixed using RNAlater® and frozen at -80oC until return to Earth. A duplicate set of WT Col-0 seeds was maintained at Kennedy Space Center, also in PDFU-BRIC hardware, as a ground control. Two additional sets of seedlings, not in PDFU-BRIC hardware but in enclosed containers, were maintained at Ohio University under similar environment conditions as hardware and fixative controls for the space flight samples. Proteins were analyzed using iTRAQ 8-plex tandem mass spectrometry at Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, MO. RNAseq was performed at Washington University, St. Louis, MO.\nRNA. In space flight and ground controls, 2641 soluble and 2917 membrane proteins were identified using Mascot software (Matrix Biosciences) and the TAIR10 database. The fixative, RNALater, had no detrimental effect on protein quality or identification. Analysis of hardware controls revealed 1651 differentially expressed transcripts, 108 differentially abundant soluble, and 39 membrane proteins. Analysis of samples preserved with and without RNAlater revealed 2750 genes differentially expressed and 84 soluble and 120 membrane proteins. Fold enrichment analysis of fixative controls show evidence of desiccation stress on the transcriptome. Filtering the space flight data for those transcripts and proteins expressed in fixative and hardware controls revealed 571 transcripts, 59 soluble proteins, and 36 membrane proteins deferentially expressed only as a result of space flight. Further analysis will help reveal the processes/mechanisms affected by space flight.",

Although this condition is largely attributed to the direct effects of unloading of the bone, coupling mechanisms associated with diminished bone and marrow perfusion, attenuated fluid flow within the bone, and fewer signaling molecules from vascular cells may also play a modulating role on the bone loss associated with spaceflight.\nIn the tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rat, an animal model of microgravity-induced osteopenia, hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow decrease with acute unloading (10 min) and continue to progressively decline through 28 days of unloading. The initial and chronic decrements in perfusion are primarily due to increases in osseous vascular resistance. In addition, when the HU rat hindlimb skeleton is reloaded during standing, long bone and marrow perfusion are lower and vascular resistance higher than that in standing control animals. These higher vascular resistances in HU rats could result from 1) increased vasoconstrictor responses of bone resistance arteries, or 2) decreased endothelium-dependent and/or endothelium-independent vasodilator responsiveness of bone resistance arteries.\nSpecific Aims:\nAim 1. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the responsiveness of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) to myogenic and vasoconstrictor stimuli.\nAim 2. To evaluate the contribution of endothelium-derived NO (nitric oxide) and vasodilator prostaglandins to acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin (BK), and flow-induced vasodilation in the femoral PNA from control and HU rats.\nAim 3. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the expression of endothelial NOS (eNOS), COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein, as well as M2-receptor (ACh) and B2-receptor (BK) mRNA, in the femoral PNA.\nAim 4. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the PNA responsiveness to endothelium-independent vasodilator stimuli.\nAim 5. To determine whether hindlimb unloading, radiation exposure, and the combined effects of these treatments alter endothelium-dependent vasodilation through NO or PGI2 signaling pathways, and to determine whether this is related to changes in bone volume and indices of cancellous bone micro-architecture.\nThe general hypothesis of this proposal is that skeletal unloading induces alterations in skeletal resistance artery function; these alterations serve to diminish bone perfusion and ultimately disrupt mechanisms for maintaining the normal balance between bone formation and bone resorption. The specific purpose is to elucidate vasoconstrictor and vasodilator mechanisms involved in the control of bone and marrow perfusion, including endothelial signaling pathways forming nitric oxide and prostacyclin, in bone during conditions of unloading, and to determine whether deficits in bone blood flow and endothelium-dependent vascular signaling are related to unloading-induced bone loss. To accomplish these goals, the principal nutrient artery of the femur from control and 14 day HU rats will be isolated and cannulated for in vitro experimentation. Mechanisms of smooth muscle and endothelial cell function in the osseous circulation will be determined, as well as how skeletal unloading alters these vasoconstrictor and vasodilator control mechanisms (Aims 1-4). Studies will then be conducted using adenoviral gene transfer (Aim 5) to manipulate bone and marrow perfusion and endothelium-dependent vasodilation to determine whether blood flow and vascular endothelial cell signaling is coupled to disuse-associated bone remodeling in the femur (i.e., bone formation rates, mass, total, cortical and cancellous bone mineral density, and mechanical strength). These studies will extend our knowledge and understanding of how skeletal unloading alters fluid and vascular coupling mechanisms, which have been suggested to modulate the balance of bone formation and degradation during microgravity. These studies may also provide new insight into the etiology of other degenerative bone disorders that occur concomitantly with cardiovascular dysfunction, such as heart disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and old age.",

Two additional manuscripts that will cite support from this grant are in preparation. In the first unpublished study, we examined whether simulated weightlessness and space-relevant irradiation of mice alters vascular responsiveness and bone properties 6-7 months after these treatment interventions, i.e., following a 6-7 period of normal weight bearing recovery. This period of recovery in mice is equivalent to approximately 20 human years. The data demonstrate that only high-LET (linear energy transfer) total body irradiation (TBI), but not hindlimb unloading (HU), has a sustained effect on endothelium-dependent vasodilation following the period of recovery, and that the combined effects of these two treatments (TBI-HU) to impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation is also sustained following the recovery period. The was a tendency for the trabecular bone volume fraction (trabecular bone volume/total bone volume) of the proximal tibia from TBI-HU mice to be lower than that in control mice, but this was not significant. Decrements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation are significantly correlated with changes in bone volume, indicating a coupling of vascular endothelial cell function is associated with bone loss induced by HU and TBI. This observation is similar to that which we reported earlier in mice where the effects of HU and TBI were determined immediately after the cessation of these treatments (Ghosh et al., Radiat. Res. 185: 257-266, 2016), although the relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and bone volume fraction was not as robust following the recovery period. Collectively, these data demonstrate the important relation between bone blood flow, bone vascular function, and trabecular bone volume.\nFor the second manuscript in preparation, we examined the effects of a commonly used countermeasure for spaceflight-induced bone loss (i.e., exercise) to determine its effect on bone blood flow. Like that shown to occur in hindlimb bones with chronic unloading (Stabley et al., 2013), old age also diminishes perfusion of bone marrow and regions of bone containing high volumes of trabecular bone. Results from this study demonstrate that 10-12 weeks of low-intensity exercise training (ET) restores bone perfusion in old (25-26 months old) rats to levels occurring in young adult (6 months old) animals. Thus, these data support the notion that regular physical activity maintains and improves bone perfusion and bone health.\nStabley JN, Prisby RD, Behnke BJ, Delp MD. \"Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.\" Bone. 2013 Dec;57(2):355-60.",

This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.\nThese experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.\nA significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.",

            "task_progress": "Summary of Major Results\n***Project 1: Phototropic curvature***\nUtilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) on board the International Space Station (ISS), we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B.  Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1 g.  A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1 g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination.  Additionally, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be a product of directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravity.\n***Project 2: Gene Profiling***\nThe transcriptome of seedlings were analyzed from experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) to study the interacting effects of light and gravity on plant tropisms.  Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated and grown in cassettes in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for 4 days at 1g then exposed to a range of gravitational accelerations (microgravity, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53g, and 1g) and light treatments (blue light with or without a 1 hour pretreatment with red light).  At the end of the space experiments, the cassettes containing the seedlings were frozen in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) and returned to Earth on space shuttle STS-131.  The RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and used for the transcriptome analyses. A comparison of 1g-treated-spaceflight samples with ground controls identified 230 genes that were differentially regulated at least two-fold (p < 0.01). A further comparison of all spaceflight samples with ground controls identified approximately 280 genes that were differentially regulated at least two fold (p < 0.01).  Of these genes, several were involved in regulating cell polarity (i.e., auxin, calcium, lipid metabolism), cell wall development, oxygen status, and cell defense or stress. However, when the transcriptome of the all g-treated spaceflight samples were compared with microgravity samples, only approx.130 genes were identified as being differently regulated (p < 0.01). Of these, only 27 were at least 2 fold differently regulated between microgravity and 1g samples and included putatitive/pseudo/undefined genes (n=14), transposable elements (n=5), an expansin (ATEXP24; At1g21240), a cell-wall kinase (WAK3; At1g21240), a laccase-like flavonoid oxidase (TT10;At5g48100), among others.   Not surprisingly, there was a difference in the % of genes represented in individual gene categories when comparing spaceflight samples with ground controls and spaceflight microgravity versus spaceflight g-treated space samples.   These results emphasize the need for tissue fixation on the centrifuge for an accurate spaceflight control.  These results are one of the few reports of transcriptome analyses from a space experiment with plants that had gravity treatments using an on-board centrifuge.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by  \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

            "task_description": "Spaceflight, by impairing the differentiation program of stem cells residing within bone marrow results in bone loss, increased bone marrow adiposity, anemia, and impaired immune function.  Because these disturbances may potentially compromise the success of long-duration flights, there exists an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and implement effective countermeasures.  We propose to test the novel hypothesis that negative energy balance during spaceflight results in 1) bone marrow dysfunction and increased marrow adiposity and 2) altered signaling by  peripheral adipokines (cytokines produced by adipocytes) all of which, in turn, contribute to negative bone turnover balance and bone loss.  The proposed research will focus on the precise role of adipose tissue and the important adipokine leptin in mediating the detrimental effects of simulated spaceflight (hindlimb unloading (HU)) on bone marrow cells in mice by accomplishing the following 2 specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that increased bone marrow adiposity plays a causal role in mediating simulated spaceflight-induced changes in bone metabolism.  This will be accomplished by comparing the skeletal response to hindlimb unloading of wild type (WT) mice with mice incapable of generating bone marrow adipocytes (kit-receptor-deficient KitW/W-v mice).  Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, by targeting the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells, plays a key role in mediating energy sensitive changes in bone metabolism during simulated spaceflight.  This will be accomplished by examining whether transplantation of mesenchymal or hematopoietic stem cells from leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice into WT mice alters bone loss during simulated spaceflight. Completion of the proposed project is expected to increase our understanding of the role of energy metabolism in mediating bone loss during simulated spaceflight and suggest specific non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of spaceflight on bone marrow.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Osteoporosis is a major health concern.  To our knowledge, all forms of osteoporosis involve infiltration of fat into bone marrow.  If the increased marrow fat alters the magnitude of bone loss, as hypothesized, this research will have significance to human health that transcends protecting astronauts from bone loss during spaceflight.\nSuccessful completion of the proposed research involved substantial model development and validation and this work will have impact far beyond the specific aims of this project.  To accomplish Specific Aim 1, it was necessary to perform adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow cells into kitw/w-v mice (Specific Aim 1).  While bone marrow transplantation is routinely performed in the field of immunology, the impact of whole body sub-lethal and lethal radiation typically used to perform the procedure on the skeleton has received little attention.  In the course of validating our model we performed several pilot studies that led to the unexpected finding that high dose radiation with photons, while having devastating effects on the hematopoietic compartment actually induces bone lining cells to become osteoblasts, leading to a transient increase in bone formation.  Based on the likelihood that this activation of bone lining cells represents a potential therapeutic target we hope to pursue the mechanism for this response.  Additionally, we made major advances in optimizing adoptive transfer for bone research: we have developed a protocol where following lethal irradiation we have quantitatively replaced hematopoietic cells in bone marrow with donor cells with no bone loss.  This was accomplished with as few as 750 purified hematopoietic stem cells (publication in review and publication in preparation).\nMice exhibit premature age-related cancellous bone loss. Specifically, as much as 2/3 of the cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis is resorbed prior to establishment of peak total bone mass.  The negative implication of this bone loss for HU studies is obvious. The mechanism, however, was unknown. In the course of performing studies in which mice were housed at thermoneutral (32°C) to minimize adaptive thermogenesis, we noted that the mice housed at this warm temperature showed unusually high cancellous bone volume fraction.  Further investigation confirmed that premature cancellous bone loss in mice housed at room temperature is caused by mild cold stress (Iwaniec et al., 2016). While the low cancellous bone mass at clinically relevant sites in skeletally mature mice is an issue for preclinical studies, an even more important issue is whether physiological adaptation to mild cold stress influences the outcome of preclinical studies. This is of particular concern to spaceflight studies where mice housed at subthermoneutral temperatures during microgravity are likely to be more dependent upon adaptive thermogenesis than weight bearing controls, leading to bone loss independent of reduced weight bearing.\nReference: Iwaniec UT, Philbrick KA, Wong CP, Gordon JL, Kahler-Quesada AM, Olson DA,   Branscum AJ, Sargent JL, DeMambro VE, Rosen CJ, Turner RT.

As described in detail in Keune et al., 2016, bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increased in the distal femur metaphysis during spaceflight.  During the same interval there was a reduction in cancellous bone volume fraction.  The observed bone loss was due to increased bone resorption; osteoblast number, osteoblast activity and osteoblast turnover were normal.  In agreement, HU resulted in bone loss in male mice and the bone loss was due to increased bone resorption.  However, we were surprised to find that HU did not result in an increase in MAT (publication under review) in WBB6F1/J mice.  It should be noted that this unexpected finding was replicated in HU C57BL6 mice (publication in preparation). We conclude from these results that increased MAT is not a prerequisite for bone loss in HU mice.\nWe originally hypothesized that mice incapable of producing MAT would be protected from HU-induced cancellous bone loss whereas mice with excessive MAT would exhibit increased bone loss.  We tested these hypotheses using kitw/w-v (MAT-deficient) mice and ob/ob (excessive MAT) mice.  As expected, decreased MAT was associated with increased bone formation and increased MAT was associated with decreased bone formation.  However, HU-induced cancellous bone loss was exaggerated in MAT- mice and not impacted by excessive MAT (publication in preparation).\nTaken together, our studies demonstrate that spaceflight-induced cancellous bone loss in ovariectomized rats and HU-induced cancellous bone loss in male mice each occur as a result of increased bone turnover, where the increase in resorption is inadequately compensated for by bone formation.  While lineage decision (mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts or adipocytes) was shown to influence bone formation and MAT levels, our findings do not support a causal relationship between MAT infiltration and bone loss during spaceflight.  Indeed, our studies in MAT-deficient mice suggest that MAT may have a protective role in limiting bone loss.  Further research will be required to verify these findings and determine the underlying mechanisms.\nSpecific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, by targeting the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells, plays a key role in mediating energy sensitive changes in bone metabolism during simulated spaceflight.\nWe performed a series of studies to test this hypothesis. Initial studies were focused on establishing the effects of leptin on MAT and bone turnover in normal rats and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (Turner et al., 2014; Turner et al., 2015; Philbrick KA et al., 2015; Lindenmaier et al., 2016). We also addressed the controversy as to whether the physiological actions of leptin on bone are mediated through peripheral or central nervous system (CNS)-mediated signaling (publication under review).  This question is important because leptin regulates energy metabolism through CNS signaling.  Subsequent studies focused on how leptin impacts bone and energy metabolism during HU (publication in preparation).\nTaken together, our studies provide strong evidence that leptin administered subcutaneously and hypothalamic leptin gene therapy have surprisingly similar effects on bone metabolism in ob/ob mice; specifically, leptin decreased MAT, increased osteoblast number and activity, and increased osteoclast activity.  Dose response studies revealed that the skeletal effects of leptin occur at very low circulating levels of the hormone (levels having minimal effects on food intake or body weight), suggesting that previously published reports demonstrating skeletal effects of leptin delivered into the hypothalamus were due to transport of leptin into peripheral circulation and not due to CNS mediated actions.  If confirmed, our finding that the actions of peripheral leptin on bone and central actions of leptin on energy metabolism are dissociable from one another would represent a paradigm shift.\nIt is well established that there is a close association between the magnitude of mechanical loading of the skeleton and bone mass, and that bone loss often accompanies weight loss induced by dieting (Iwaniec and Turner, 2016).  Potentially, this is due to combined decreases in peripheral and CNS leptin levels.  In support, we have shown that increasing hypothalamic levels in adult rats can reduce body weight but, in contrast to caloric restriction, promote weight loss without bone loss (Turner et al., 2015). It is well established that weight loss due to reduced food intake contributes to bone loss during HU and for this reason, weight bearing controls are normally pair-fed to HU rodents.  However, as shown for weight bearing rodents (Turner et al., 2015), leptin treatment of HU ob/ob mice, although inducing weight loss, did not result in further bone loss (publication in preparation).\nReferences\nKeune, JA, Philbrick KA, Branscum AJ, Iwaniec UT, Turner RT.

Recent advancement in the field of molecular biology revealed that a different class of RNA, the small non-coding microRNA (miRNA), can have a broad effect on gene expression networks by mainly inhibiting the translational process. In this experiment conducted on the International Space Station (ISS), we propose to test the hypotheses that miRNA profiles will be altered in the space environment, and that cellular responses to DNA damage in space are different from those on the ground.",

            "task_progress": "On April 18, 2014, our Micro-7 payload was launched at Kennedy Space Center. The cells arrived on the International Space Station on April 22. Our payload consisted of two experiments. In the experiment aimed at studying RNA/miRNA expression changes in non-dividing cells in space, human fibroblast cells were fixed with RNAlater2 on April 25 and on May 5, which corresponded to 3 and 14 days after reaching orbit, respectively. The cells were also fixed with paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry staining. For investigations of altered cellular responses to DNA damage, human fibroblast cells were treated with bleomycin on April 22 (Day 3). After a 3-hour treatment, the cells were fixed with RNAlater2 for RNA/miRNA analysis and with paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry staining.\nSummary of Present Micro-7 Experimental Results\nRNA/miRNA experiment:\nOur Micro-7 payload consisted of two experiments. In the experiment aimed at studying RNA/miRNA expression changes in non-dividing cells in space, cells in 4 BioCells in space and on the ground, respectively, were fixed with RNALaterII on Day 3 and again on Day 14. Hierarchical clustering analysis indicated expressions of 1924 genes with a false discovery rate FDR<0.08 for both the flight and ground samples on Day 3. These genes were well clustered between the quadruplicates of the flight and ground samples. However, no significant differences in gene expressions between the ground and flown cells were found on Day 14. A PCA of 47k probes showed that each of the three components accounted for 19.5%, 13.5%, and 9.6%, respectively, of the data set variance. Our PCA mapped a total of 42.6% of the data set variance. Of the genes analyzed, 170 were found to have significant expression changes between space and ground conditions in the Day 3 samples. This compares to only 3 genes showing similarly significant expression changes between space and ground by Day 14. Additionally, none of the 170 genes identified in the Day 3 comparison overlapped with genes identified in the Day 14 comparison. Of these 170 genes, 117 have known protein coding functions.\nFor identification of pathways and networks in the flown cells on Day 3, the list of 170 genes and 29 miRNAs with their respective expression changes were analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool. The top upstream regulators that were identified included Vegf, HGF, Ca2+, and RELA.  In addition to the above four top regulators, MAPK8 and TNFRSF10B were among the nodes. The miRNAs that were identified in the network included the Let-7 family, miR-29b, and miR-708.\nThis part of the project has been completed and a manuscript has been published in the June, 2016 issue of FASEB J.\nDNA damage response experiment\nFor investigations of the cellular response to DNA damage from bleomycin treatment, human fibroblast cells were treated with bleomycin at a final concentration of 1 microg/ml on April 22 (Day 3). After a 3-hour treatment, the cells were fixed with RNAlater2 for RNA/miRNA analysis and with paraformaldehyde for immunostaining. In flight, there were 52 genes whose expressions were significantly altered as a consequence of bleomycin treatment during flight experiment. On the other hand, in ground cells treated with bleomycin, 42 genes showed significant expression changes. Among these genes, 22 were common in both contrasts. Analysis of pathways using the IPA software demonstrated that p53 was the primary pathway responding to the bleomycin treatment in both the flown and ground cells. In addition, TP73 and RELA were involved in both the flown and ground cells in response to bleomycin treatment. TP53, TP73, and RELA were among the top 5 upstream regulators identified with IPA. Including the indirect interactions, our data with bleomycin produced similar responses as other chemical toxins that induce DNA damages such as hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin, and mitomycin C.",

            "task_description": "The amount of bone loss between individual astronauts is highly variable with some astronauts losing large amounts of bone while others are largely unaffected. This variability is accounted for, at least to a large extent, by genetic variations between individuals. Unfortunately, the specific genes that modulate this genetic sensitivity of bone loss in microgravity are unknown.  To this end, we have recently completed a genetic study in which we identified specific regions on chromosomes (QTL or Quantitative Trait Loci) that either add to or reduce the propensity of an individual to lose bone when normal weightbearing is removed from the musculoskeleton. While providing critical information, these QTL still contain hundreds of genes, rather than a single one. Here, we propose first to greatly reduce the number of candidate genes with bioinformatics tools and then experimentally test the shortlist of candidate genes using knockout mice available from the Jackson Laboratory’s (JAX) Genetic Resource Repository and the JAX Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP) production center. The identification of single genes modulating bone loss during weightlessness can be used as a critical diagnostic tool for the identification of astronauts most in need of countermeasures as well as to unravel novel drug targets that preserve bone health in space.",

            "task_description": "This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. As in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments. Additional benefits of the project include training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.",

Therefore, biological questions are investigated in conjunction with physical principles. We intend to analyze the effect of static magnetic fields on biological systems. This work will provide a starting point for the current discussion of the detrimental effects of (electro)magnetic fields. In addition, understanding basic biological questions will improve the prospect for enhanced plant productivity, resource optimization, and reduced maintenance."

            "task_progress": "Report for activities since April 2015\nTime line: Space-X3 launched April 18, 2014; the payload returned May 18 and arrived at KSC 5/21/14. Post flight processing was accomplished between 5/22 and 5/25/14. Ground control experiments (performed Aug. 14, 2014) ran into additional delays because of a shortage of hardware (MFCs were badly corroded during flight experiment so that flight hardware could not be used for the ground control). The first ground control experiment resulted in lack of germination (likely the result of RNALater related NH3 contamination), and fixative leaked. Difficulties to obtain approval for a second clinorotated ground control delayed the second ground control experiment until Jan. 7, 2015. A no-cost extension ensured that most (but not all) analyses were completed. Subsequent work was substantially affected by the departure of the post-doctoral research associate who obtained a job offer in Korea that could not be refused or postponed.\nThe analyses of cytoskeletal arrangements was performed by confocal microcopy by June 2015; analyses are ongoing and almost complete. This effort is part of Andrea Edge’s PhD research.   Light microscopy started with sample embedding during de-integration; sectioning was performed in a six-month period (4/2015 – 9/2015, together with corresponding samples from ground controls). Analyses are partially complete and ongoing. Substantial results were obtained.  The experiment provided exciting insights in the gravitropic mechanism of roots, their adaptive responses, and gene regulation during flight and ground controls.\nResults:\nFlight experiment:\nA) Imaging.   The most important part of the flight experiment was the confirmation of the effect of high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) on root curvature. The data provide clear evidence that HGMF does induce root curvature as theory and ground experiments predicted. Because curvature occurred in weightlessness conditions, the gravisensing system of roots is not compromised by space flight. The enhancement of the amyloplast size in space-grown roots (see D, below) indicates metabolic adaptation to reduced effective gravity levels. The induction of curvature by HGMF in space-grown roots indicates that amyloplasts are indeed the organelles that elicit differential growth and therefore the originators of gravitropism.\nB) Cytoskeletal arrangements.   The comparison between static, clinorotated, and space grown roots did not show any substantial differences between the cytoskeletal organization of actin or microtubules. A high resolution analysis showed a greater variation in orientation and coherency of both microtubules and F-actin after clinorotation.\nC) Gene expression.   The examined genes were selected to metabolic relevance and connection to differential elongation. The chosen genes were (in order of average transcription levels with accession number in parentheses): Cytochrome c oxidase, amylase, Ubiquitin, Phosphofructokinase, Hexokinase, Alcohol dehydrogenase, Tubulin, Actin 7, P Pin-formed 1, 3, 7, Sucrose synthase, IAA transcription factor 5, Glucokinase, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Triacylglycerol lipase.\nComparisons of different conditions included flight conditions, clinorotation, and static ground conditions, with and without HGMF. Measurements were performed in the root tip, root proper, root shoot junction, and seed tissue. Gene transcription levels were assessed with validated primers using SYBR-Green based qPCR analysis.\nComparisons were based on regressions of the transcription levels of all examined genes and served as basis for the identification of up-or downregulated genes. The methodology resulted in a publication (Houston et al., 2015) and provides reliable assessment of gene regulation. Genes that responded to space condition, clinorotation, and HGMF included auxin transporter PIN1-7, enzymes involved in glycolysis (hexokinase, glucokinase), and sucrose synthase. However, not all tissues responded equally.\nD) Light microscopy.   The purpose of these studies was the identification of amyloplast positioning and size in the root cap. The difference between the size of amyloplasts from space-grown roots and those obtained from clinorotated or static roots was derived from systematic measurements of all detectable starch grains. The difference was highly significant and amounted to an approximate size increase of 30% in diameter. The amyloplast studies are important because they indicate that clinorotation (i.e., hyper-stimulation) reduces amyloplast size. Therefore clinorotation is likely to reduce gravisensitivity.\nIt is anticipated that a publication reporting on the results of the flight experiment will be submitted by summer 2016.",

            "task_description": "The negative effects of space flight on cardiovascular health has been demonstrated and documented over many years. One of the body’s normal vascular repair mechanisms is the recruitment of adult stem cells from bone marrow to integrate into the vasculature. These recruited cells are involved in blood vessel wall repair and the formation of new blood vessels. This proposal seeks to study the effect of microgravity on adult stem cells. We are specifically interested in how well these cells can differentiate into vascular cells under altered environmental conditions such as microgravity. Further, we hope to study how well these cells function as healthy vascular cells once differentiated. We propose to conduct differentiation studies using a bioreactor able to expose the cells to microgravity conditions. Once differentiated, the cells will be exposed to several stimulatory environments that will demonstrate their important functional ability. Utilizing molecular biology techniques, such as gene expression studies, we hope to elucidate the effect of microgravity on these cells. It is our hope to study adult stem cells with the goal to develop countermeasures for the negative effects of space flight on vascular health. This proposal addresses one of NASA's research interest, specifically, studies of the effect of gravity and the space environment on cellular and molecular processes. In this proposal, the cellular and molecular processes under investigation are stem cell differentiation and the corresponding molecular changes the stem cells undergo.",

            "task_progress": "Our progress has included completion of several goals:\n1.\tGoal:  Optimizing bioreactor and experimental set-up and methodology with Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs)\nThe experimental set-up we proposed using a commercially available rotary cell culture system (RCCS) bioreactor (Synthecon) was optimized using HUVEC cells.  Our goal was to optimize various bioreactor/experimental parameters such as microcarrier bead handling and protein coating, cell seeding density and culture parameters, bioreactor rotational speed, culture maintenance and sample extraction from bioreactor chambers, as well as overall training within the experimental system. Early project challenges such as low cell adhesion on microcarrier beads and cell detachment under dynamic conditions in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) were eventually overcome by changing our experimental design. Our results show successful cell attachment and faster proliferation of HUVECs under microgravity than under static conditions.\n2.\tGoal: Isolation and culture of human endothelial progenitor cells and differentiation into endothelial cells\nOnce our bioreactor and experimental setup was optimized, we extended our work to the target cell population that is the focus of this work, human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) derived from circulating blood.  The human EPCs are a rare population of stem/progenitor cells that are isolated from the peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMNC) fraction of whole blood. PBMNCs were isolated from human blood obtained from donors as per Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines. Circulating progenitor cells contained within the PBMNC fraction of whole blood were differentiated into endothelial-like cells, as confirmed by the formation of colonies (within 2-6 weeks) with EC specific ‘cobble-stone’ morphology, and positive expression of EC specific proteins.\n3.\tGoal: Study the effect of microgravity on the differentiated endothelial cells in culture\nWe assessed the ability of these cells to adapt to microgravity conditions after short term culture and expansion. More specifically, the functionality of the differentiated ECs following exposure to simulated microgravity assessed conditions such as proliferation, release of soluble factors, changes in gene expression, and anti-thrombogenic potential was investigated.\nMore specifically, the progress made is as follows:\n3a. Cell proliferation:   Initially microgravity caused a delay in proliferation of the endothelial cells.  On prolonged exposure there was an increase in proliferation of microgravity-exposed cells when compared to the normal gravity cultured controls.\n3b. Gene Expression of hsp70:   Further we investigated the ability of HE-like cells to sense microgravity as a stressful condition and adapt to it by regulating the levels of stress proteins such as hsp70.  Our results show that microgravity-cultured cells upregulated gene expression of HSPA4 after 2 days of culture.  However, on prolonged exposure there was no difference in the level of HSPA4 between simulated microgravity and normal gravity.\n3c. Endothelial Cell secretory functions:   Secretion of Nitric Oxide (NO), Interleukin-6, and Tissue Plasminogen Activator--  Our results indicate that HE-like cells cultured under microgravity for 2 days upregulated release of amount of soluble NO when compared to the respective normal gravity controls while on prolonged exposure the amount of NO released by both microgravity cultured as well as normal gravity cultured cells were identical. Assessment of the release of soluble IL-6, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine, show that culture under microgravity conditions for 2 and 4 days led to significant decrease in secretion of soluble IL-6 in the cell culture medium when compared to normal gravity cultured controls.  Quantification of the release of soluble tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) into the surrounding cell culture medium showed that tPA released by HE-like cells cultured under microgravity conditions for 2 and 4 days were significantly lower than their respective normal gravity cultured controls.\n3d. Plasma clotting kinetics:   To further study and confirm the direct impact of microgravity on the ability of these cells to regulate clotting, we performed a modified version of plasma clotting assay. This assay provides a robust and direct method to assess and compare the anti-thrombogenic potential of HE-like cells cultured under different gravity conditions. Once clotting was activated, progress to full clot formation was assessed spectrophotometrically by continuous monitoring of the change in absorbance over 30 min.   Our results show that the kinetic profile of plasma clotting when incubated with HE-like cells cultured under simulated microgravity showed an earlier onset to clot formation than normal gravity controls.  The quantification of the time taken to complete clot formation showed recalcified plasma clots faster when incubated with HE-like cells cultured under simulated microgravity as compared to normal gravity cultured HE-like cells.\nIn summary, the results of the present study demonstrate that the populations of human blood EPC derived endothelial cells when exposed to microgravity proliferate faster, release higher amount of soluble NO, and lower amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, when compared to their normal gravity cultured controls. This can be rationalized and understood as the ability of the cells to sense microgravity and adapt by upregulating gene expression of hsp70. However, these secretory as well as proliferative functions did not affect the anti-thrombogenic functions of these cells. Their anti-coagulative and anti-thrombogenic ability as assessed by both upregulation of tPA as well their ability to delay plasma clotting, were impaired on exposure to microgravity.\n4.\tGoal: Expand to include porcine EPCs to further study the effect of microgravity on differentiation of the blood derived EPCs\nDue to the initial challenges we had faced with differentiating as well exposing human blood derived progenitor cells during the pre-differentation stage under simulated microgravity, our goal was to extend our work to an alternative cell source, porcine EPCs.  Our lab has previously obtained porcine PBMNCs (under University of Florida IACUC approval) and differentiated these into cells with endothelial cell phenotype (PE-like cells). Circulating progenitor cells contained within the PBMNC fraction of porcine whole blood were exposed to simulated microgravity, using a RWV bioreactor. After exposing the circulating progenitor cells to 6, 12, and 18h of simulated microgravity, the cells were then cultured on fibronectin coated TCP under static conditions and their ability to differentiate into endothelial cells was assessed by the formation of colonies with EC specific ‘cobble-stone’ morphology and confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for CD31 as well as eNOS. Our results showed that longer exposure to simulated microgravity delayed the onset of differentiation of EPCs to PE-like cells.\nFurther, we investigated the effect of this altered condition on the downstream functional abilities of the differentiated endothelial-like cells that were pre-exposed to microgravity.\n4a. Colony formation:   Assessed by quantifying the number of endothelial-cell colonies formed showing the onset of differentiation of EPCs to ECs.  Our results show that the average rate of endothelial cell colony formation decreased with increased time of exposure to simulated microgravity.  Cells exposed to microgravity for longer than 18h showed significantly reduced or no colony formation\n4b. Cell Proliferation and Migration:   The differentiated cells were assessed for their proliferation and migratory ability. Migration was assessed by observing and quantifying the migration of cells into an area cleared of cells. The quantification of percentage area of the scratch covered by the migrating cells indicated a direct decrease in migration ability of the EC with increased time of exposure of the progenitor cells under simulated microgravity.  The effect of pre-exposure to µg on the proliferative capacity of the EC-like cells was also assessed by quantifying the change in DNA over time in cultured cells. These data collectively show that both the migratory ability and proliferative ability of ECs are impaired by pre-exposure of the EPCs to microgravity. While increased exposure time to µg impaired the migration of the microgravity exposed cells, the proliferation of these cells seem to be enhanced by increased time of microgravity pre-exposure.\n4c. Endothelial cell secretory functions:   We further investigated the ability of these cells to secrete soluble factors such as nitric oxide (NO) as well PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) into the surrounding cell culture medium. Our data collectively shows the ability of short term microgravity exposure of EPCs to inhibit the regulation of release anti thrombogenic molecules into the surrounding medium. However with increased time of microgravity exposure, a potential recovery effect is also observed where the 12h and 18h-µg exposed cells secrete NO and PGE2 in levels comparable to the cells cultured under normal gravity.\n4d. Whole Blood and Plasma Clotting kinetics:   To understand the ability of the cells to regulate clotting mechanisms, whole blood clotting and recalcified plasma clotting studies as described above were subsequently performed on these cells. Plasma recalcification clotting profiles indicated that as expected the TCP surface induced highest rate of plasma clotting within the first 90 seconds followed by 6h µg exposed PE-like cells.\nFollowing the clotting rate for 6h-µg exposed cells are the clotting times for the 12h and 18h-µg exposed cells. Normal gravity cultured cells clotted the next while the last to clot was the plasma exposed to the EC control cells. Similarly, the whole blood clotting kinetics showed that the kinetic profile of whole clotting when incubated with PE-like cells differentiated culture under simulated microgravity, showed faster clot formation than normal gravity controls.  However, longer exposure times showed greater inhibition of clotting.\nCollectively, the data shows that within the 3 time points of µg exposure, the longer exposure times showed greater inhibition of clotting, which may be attributed to the increased ability to release soluble anti-thrombogenic factors, NO and PGE2. While both the migration and proliferation of cells were inhibited by microgravity exposure, prolonged exposure of EPCs to microgravity resulted in decrease in the migration abilities of EPC derived EC and the proliferative capacity of the ECs seemed to recover on longer time of exposure. The initial decrease and subsequent increase in release of soluble factors such as NO and PGE2 reaffirmed the possibility of recovery mechanisms being involved on prolonged exposure to weightlessness. Finally the assessment of whole blood and plasma clotting, indicated that microgravity pre exposure at the progenitor stage caused inhibition, in the ability of PE-like cells to delay blood or plasma clotting while this effect was again nulled with increase in time of exposure of EPCs to microgravity. This data collectively provides some insight into the role of short term exposure to low shear stress environment due to simulated microgravity, on cardiovascular deconditioning during space travel.",

            "task_description": "Plants experiencing spaceflight are quite normal in appearance but can exhibit growth habits distinctly different from plants on Earth. Historically the spaceflight-induced differences were difficult to dissect due to changing hardware and flight conditions. With the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) and a consistent International Space Station (ISS) orbital environment, it is now possible to confidently approach a dissection of the molecular biology guiding the altered growth of plants in spaceflight. This proposal involves experiments that specifically address growth and molecular changes in Arabidopsis that occur during spaceflight, bringing the molecular and genetic tools of Arabidopsis to bear on fundamental questions of root morphology, growth, and cell wall remodeling. During the Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit - Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System (APEX-TAGES) experiments, we observed a remarkable number of gene expression changes during spaceflight that are associated with cell wall restructuring, especially in roots. We also observed, with the ABRS/GIS (GFP Imaging System) imaging system, genetically dependent changes in root growth direction, movement, and structure. The current experiments will employ the ABRS and the GIS to dissect and better understand the molecular changes guiding growth restructuring on orbit. In particular we hypothesize that spaceflight conditions engender a constant state of root cell wall modification during the cell file rotations that characterize spaceflight-induced root skewing. The specific experiments will involve mutants in root growth and cell wall signaling pathways identified in our previous spaceflight molecular studies, as well as new Green Fluorescent Protein biosensor lines also based on the genes identified in the previous flight experiments.\nThe overall goal of our program is to understand fundamental molecular biological responses to extraterrestrial environments. This goal aligns with fundamental Space Biology goals to understand the impact of spaceflight on biological systems to better enable the exploration imperative. We have used molecular biology and genetically tagged plants as biological monitors of spaceflight and space-related environments with great science return, leading to the development of new biological and hardware tools to study the spaceflight response with even higher fidelity in a wider variety of spaceflight-related environments. The focus of the current proposal is to build on these data and other insights gained from the execution of the APEX-TAGES experiments in the ABRS /GIS, advancing science while also advancing the telemetric imaging hardware and biological experiment support for the ISS and future platforms\nGaining insights into such mechanisms is recognized as fundamental within the decadal study and underpins answers to some of the biggest questions in spaceflight plant biology.",

            "task_progress": "Final Summary:\nThe APEX03 experiment was a natural follow-on of the APEX01 experiment, and is an outstanding example of how the ISS can be utilized as an exploration laboratory to more science forward in a given field.  In APEX01 we showed that plants responded to the spaceflight environment in a highly tissue-specific manner, and that cell wall remodeling played a large role in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Further, we refuted the paradigm set forth by Darwin in the 1880s that plants require gravity to initiate the root behavior called “skewing,” and fluorescent reporter genes suggested that there were changes in auxin signaling over time on orbit. In APEX03 we set forth to dissect the molecular changes over a developmental time course, utilize mutants in critical skewing and cell wall remodeling signal transduction pathways, and also use targeted fluorescent imaging of auxin-regulated genes in the specific cells of the root tip that guide root navigation.\nAlthough the transcriptome analyses are ongoing, preliminary data suggest that development age plays a substantial role in the physiological adaptation process Transcriptomes were first evaluated four days after germination, where there were numerous differentially expressed genes (compared to ground controls). A set of sister plants were evaluated 8 days after germination on orbit, and it was found that as the plants develop, the number of genes needed to satisfy the needs of the physiological adaptation process diminishes.\nIn the on orbit microscopy experiments (utilizing the Light Microscopy module – the LMM) we found that auxin distributions in the gravity-sensing cells of the primary root are not gravity dependent, even though these distributions are key to gravity responses on Earth. It is therefore likely that the role of gravity is minimal compared to the inherent developmental cues guided by auxin to define the architecture of the root tip.  Those developmental auxin gradients were co-opted then to be sensitive to gravity responses and it seems logical then that the auxin signaling system in roots was present in plants as a developmental system before evolving additional roles in gravity responses. These data actually changed aspects of a long held paradigm in plant biology that gravity is central to setting up the gradient of auxin distribution in a vertically growing root – called the “reverse fountain” model of auxin distribution. The term “vertical” carries a direct association with the gravity vector. Without the ability to remove gravity from the plant environment, there was no reason to eliminate the term from the vernacular or the force of gravity from the concept. Our results show that the reverse fountain is neither reverse nor a fountain, as these terms imply that gravity is involved in the reversal of liquid flow. Rather, the auxin flow of the primary root tip is fundamentally no different from the auxin flow systems that guide other parts of plant primary development, except that it has been further engaged in the gravity response.",

            "task_description": "Astronauts are exposed to weightlessness and ionizing radiation during spaceflight. To combat the bone loss that results from weightlessness, astronauts spend a substantial amount of time exercising or, in the future, will be exposed to artificial gravity as a countermeasure. We aim to study these environmental conditions using basic biological models in ground-based work that lays the ground work for future work.\nThroughout life, bone remodeling is intimately tied to sex steroid hormones and their activated receptors. In females, estrogen receptors regulate growth plate closure, cessation of periosteal and endosteal bone growth, and cessation of cancellous bone resorption, among other things. Whether sex-steroid hormones and their receptors are modulated in skeletal tissue during long-duration spaceflight is unclear.\nThis Presidential Early Career Award for Scientist and Engineers (PECASE) award consisted of five sub-projects:\nProject 1, Title: Epigenetic Regulation During Simulated Spaceflight: MicroRNA Expression and Methylation-Specific Sequencing. Description and Aim: This work complements the methylation work performed in the previous Space Biology New Investigator Grant (\"Bone Loss During Simulated Weightlessness: The Role of Osteoclasts\", ended 2015), by allowing ‘omics approaches to cover larger swaths of the genome (e.g., whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing). Additionally, this project will extend the type of epigenetic mechanisms to be studied beyond DNA methylation, specifically, microRNA expression. Hypotheses: Removal of mechanical loading or, oppositely, elevations of mechanical loading induce pro-bone resorbing or pro-bone forming changes in bone cell gene expression, respectively, via epigenetic mechanisms.\nProject 2, Title: Skeletal Sex Hormone Receptors and Simulated Spaceflight. Description and Aim: This work complements an upcoming space mission (Principal Investigator (PI) : Lane Christenson, former PI Joseph Tash, Kansas University of Medical Center-KUMC, co-I April Ronca) and will define the skeletal response of female mice to simulated long-duration spaceflight in the context of sex hormones and their receptor levels in leg bones. The biological assays used included gene expression or protein quantification in bone and blood. Additionally, we will investigate cage effects on estrous cyclicity. Finally, we aim to develop an artificial-intelligence algorithm for high-throughput quantification of cell imagery of the mouse estrous cycle. Hypotheses: Mechanical disuse reduces the levels of circulating sex hormones and their receptor levels in bone. These changes contribute to understanding skeletal deterioration during long-duration spaceflight.\nAs part of this project, we proposed for and were awarded lumbar vertebrae from the Rodent Research 1 mission from the Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). We were able to quantify the cancellous bone changes from spaceflight, which will aid in future mission planning with Lane Christenson and Joe Tash.\nProject 3, Title: Investigating the effects of ionizing-radiation exposure on bone’s collagen mechanical properties. Description: Astronauts embarking on a deep-space mission to Mars will be exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation. This is of potential concern since ionizing radiation has been shown in other applications, such as radiotherapy treatment, to increase risk of fracture. While spaceflight-relevant radiation experiments so far have shown a quantitative degeneration of the tissue through loss of tissue mass, here we assessed the effects of such radiation on tissue quality. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that radiation-induced changes in collagen crosslinks would decrease the ability of mouse vertebrae to withstand cyclic mechanical loading.\nFor this project, I co-mentored an NASA Space Technology Fellow and Doctoral Candidate from University of California Berkeley, Megan Pendleton. (Megan’s fellowship covers her stipend, but does not cover animal procurement and housing. Thus, I am covering the latter and some related expenses.) This is a collaboration with Tony Keaveny (UC Berkeley) and Jean Sibonga (Johnson Space Center-JSC).\nProject 4, Title: The role of Nuclear Cytoskeleton in the Osteocytic response to Simulated Weightlessness. Description and Aim: This project aims to investigate the role of nuclear-cytoskeletal elements (LINC, Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton complexes) and related signaling cascades in the skeletal response to simulated weightlessness and radiation exposure. Description: This is a collaboration with Gunes Uzer, Boise State Univ. We investigated gene expression levels indicative of changes in this critical and emerging cytoskeletal complex.\nProject 5, Title: Characterizing the effects of chronic 2G centrifugation on the rat skeletal system. Description: This is a collaboration with Charles Fuller (UC Davis) and April Ronca (NASA Ames Research Center-ARC). Our long-term plan is to assess artificial gravity (AG) as a possible solution to mitigate these changes. In this study, one of our aims is to determine the skeletal acclimation to chronic centrifugation. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a 2G hypergravity environment causes an anabolic response in growing male rats. Specifically, we predict chronic 2G to increase tissue mineral density, bone volume fraction of the cancellous tissue, and to increase overall bone strength. Systemically, we predict that bone formation markers (i.e., osteocalcin) are elevated and resorption markers (i.e., tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) are decreased or unchanged from controls.\nProjects conducted under this award addressed multiple Research Recommendations for Animal Biology and Developmental & Reproductive Biology stated in the Space Biology Science Plan and the National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey, Recapturing Space: Life and Physical Sciences for a New Era of Exploration.

            "task_description": "May 2015 Revision to Task Agreement (Ed. note: information received September 2015).\nDue to problems obtaining samples from Kibo-JEM (Japanese Experiment Module), the project has been modified with a new title, “Bacterial, Archaeal, & Fungal Diversity of the ISS--HEPA Filter System.” The revised scope will allow the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to undertake a 28-month flight study to examine the microorganisms associated with HEPA filters. The ISS-HEPA project will develop a comprehensive census of the microbial population on the HEPA filter collected from various locations of the International Space Station (ISS), using genetic biosignatures and computational modeling. This microbial census will provide NASA with the ability to accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to overall microbial profiles, the JPL team will determine which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health.\nOriginal Task Description: Space microbiology research working groups in Japan, authorized by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), submitted proposals in response to the JAXA Announcement of Opportunity, 2012. The JAXA proposal that is managed by Principal Investigator Prof. Masao Nasu, Osaka University, contained several subgroups, including subgroup 4, headed by Dr. Takashi Yamazaki, JAXA. This subgroup 4 will conduct an investigation on “Analysis of microbial dynamics in the space habitation system by using new molecular microbial ecological techniques and also monitoring microbial contamination from air and surfaces of the ‘Kibo’ Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo-JEM).” The JAXA proposal submitted by subgroup 4 identifies the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) team headed by Dr. Kasthuri Venkateswaran as a collaborator to jointly explore the investigation.\nThe Bacterial, Archaeal, and Fungal Diversity of Kibo-JEM Surfaces project (JPL-JAXA project) will undertake a three-year flight study to examine the changes in the microorganism population on the Kibo-JEM surfaces. The JPL-JAXA project proposes to develop a comprehensive census of the microbial population on the Kibo-JEM surfaces, using genetic biosignatures and computational modeling. This census will provide NASA and JAXA with the ability to accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to overall microbial profiles, the JPL-JAXA team will determine which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health. Specific JPL-JAXA project goals will enable us to resolve applicable Human Research Program (HRP) integrated research plan (IRP) risks: (1) determine if changes in Kibo-JEM microbiome are occurring during a spaceflight mission and if so, (2) determine whether any changes noted would create a greater health risk for the crew.\nThere are three aims proposed in this JPL-JAXA project and study of the Kibo-JEM microbiome. Through optimizations and comparative evaluations of methods designed to collect, process, analyze, and archive biomolecules sampled, the JPL-JAXA team will increase downstream sensitivity of laboratory assays as well as enhance the current understanding of the population dynamics of the Kibo-JEM module (Aim 1). The JPL-JAXA team will adapt molecular technologies currently in use with the National Institute of Health (NIH) – Human Microbiome Program (HMP) Roadmap—such as rRNA gene-variable region tag sequencing, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS), and DNA microarrays, as well as cloning and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)—to comprehensively elucidate the microbial diversity profiles associated with the Kibo-JEM surfaces (Aim 2). The final project deliverable to NASA will be the Kibo-JEM database, a compilation of all of the genomic sequences and genetic information of microbes encountered on and within the Kibo-JEM habitat (Aim 3). Computational modeling of the Kibo-JEM microbial population dynamics inferred from the database will then be carried out to predict the complete spectrum of organisms present.\nThe JPL-JAXA project will compare microbial diversity, microbial characteristics, and functional capabilities of the microorganisms associated with the Kibo-JEM. The resulting database will enable HRP to evaluate the effect of spaceflight radiation and microgravity on the Kibo-JEM microbiome. The JPL-JAXA project in combination with results from studies of crew susceptibility will be used to determine the risk of microbiologically induced adverse health effects during a spaceflight mission. This assessment will allow HRP to determine if current operational and engineering controls used to mitigate microbiological risks are adequate or whether additional countermeasures should be developed.",

The whole-genome sequences (WGS) of SBMCC were generated and made available to the public. In addition to multiple copies of same microbial species, the SBMCC consists of several newly identified microorganisms. The WGS of the characterized bacterial isolates include Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriales, Bacillaceae, Agrobacterium, Klebsiella, Methylobacterium, and Staphylococcus. Moreover, isolates of fungi have also been sequenced, belonging to the members of fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.\nThis SBMCC archival of the ISS and CRV will aid in the ongoing characterization of short sequence, shot-gun metagenome surveys of the microbial diversity present in these built environments. The availability of these new WGS will also enable genetic comparisons between microorganisms sampled from Earth-based environments with those sampled from spacecraft surfaces of the ISS and CRV. Such comparisons will help to elucidate genetic adaptations that allow some of these microorganisms to become more virulent and allow all of them to survive the harsh environment of space (e.g., ionizing radiation, microgravity, desiccation, and oxidative stress). Additionally, when annotated, functional analyses of these WGS can help to identify targeted strategies for the control of problematic microorganisms that may degrade metals and plastics, become potentially pathogenic and harm astronauts, or obstruct water supply due to their biofilm forming capabilities in the engineering systems of the closed habitat.",

            "task_description": "Plants are exquisitely sensitive to mechanical stimulation which triggers changes ranging from widespread alteration in patterns of gene expression to profound shifts in development. Indeed, so pervasive is the mechanical stimulation from internal and external forces, such as the weight of tissues and organs, to a biology that has evolved under a constant 1xG, that the resultant signaling is thought to provide a required regulatory background to control a wide range of plant developmental and physiological processes. Despite this acknowledged role in plant morphogenesis, the overall contribution of such mechanical cues to plant function remains poorly defined, largely due to the difficulties in removing the pervasive 1xG-driven mechanical signal when conducting experiments on Earth. The microgravity environment of the International Space Station (ISS) therefore provides a unique tool to both directly address this hypothesis of mechanical load-driven morphogenesis, as well as to ask what features of plant growth in space reflect disruption of this mechano-signaling regulatory network. We have therefore grown seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana on board the ISS using the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFU) hardware. We are comparing their patterns of growth and gene expression to ground-based controls to ask how the well-defined \"fingerprints\" of mechanical response are altered in space. In addition, we are characterizing plants grown in space whose mechanical signaling has been artificially activated or inhibited by mutations in a gene (TCH2) which has an established role in the mechanical signaling system of plants. Results from such analyses will address the fundamental question of the role of mechanical loading on plant growth and development on Earth as well as probing how manipulating this system through targeting specific mechanoresponse genes might be used to tailor plant growth to thrive in the unique environment of spaceflight.\nThis experiment has also been supplemented with a parallel GeneLab experiment to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. These variants (ecotypes) have been chosen to span the range of likely ecotypes to be used in future spaceflight experimentation and so will provide key baseline comparisons to help understand the impact of ecotypic makeup on responses to spaceflight.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is addressing how mechanical sensing operates in plants using Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse Ear Cress). The work targets the Ca2+-dependent signaling machinery and a specific element of this machinery, a gene named touch-2, also known as calmodulin-like 24 (CML24). The patterns of growth and gene expression of wild type and mutants in CML24 grown on the International Space Station (ISS) are being compared to paired plants grown on Earth. On Earth, mechanical signaling systems are known to affect plant vigor, alter their growth habit (favoring plants that are smaller and more robust), and also impact on plant defense responses to pathogens. Therefore, this work aimed at analysis of how Ca2+ signaling is involved in the altered mechanical responses induced during spaceflight should also reveal the role for this system in the more general mechanically-linked responses of plants on Earth. Importantly, this research will allow analysis of the effects of the plant's own weight on its growth and development, research only possible in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. These results should provide molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant growth to varied mechanical environments, especially the relatively mechanically silent environments of spaceflight and controlled enclosed environments on Earth, such as greenhouses.\nThis experiment has also been supplemented with a parallel geneLAB experiment to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. The responses of these variants (ecotypes) to spaceflight will not only help further define how the altered environment of space can differentially affect even closely related varieties of plants, but also help provide important background data for the design of future spaceflight experimentation using different ecotypes of this widely adopted model plant."

            "task_progress": "This research has used the BRIC-PDFU hardware to address how the altered mechanical environment of spaceflight affects plant growth and gene expression. The research uses mutants in the core touch-response gene CALMODULIN-LIKE 24 (CML24) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and focuses on the Ca2+-dependent signaling network that operates in response to touch stimulation of plants. Both wild type and mutants in CML24 were grown on the International Space Station (ISS), chemically fixed, and then frozen on orbit and then their patterns of gene expression and growth habit compared to parallel ground controls once the samples were returned to Earth.\nThe overall experimental design was to grow seedlings of wild type, cml24-2, and cml24-4 on orbit using the BRIC-PDFU hardware, preserve the seedlings after 8 days using chemical fixation in RNAlater, and freezing in the MELFI. cml24-2 and cml24-4 are two different mutants in the CML24 gene that are thought to continuously activate or inactivate the gene respectively. Upon sample return, whole genome gene expression patterns were assessed using RNAseq to define whether the spaceflight samples showed a transcriptional \"fingerprint\" of altered mechanical responsiveness, or of other changes in signaling and response networks relative to parallel samples grown under identical conditions on the ground.\nThis experiment was also supplemented with a parallel GeneLab study to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. Arabidopsis grows across the planet and subpopulations (ecotypes) show slightly different characteristics dependent on where they originate from. The ecotypes used in the experiment were chosen to span the range of likely ecotypes to be used in future spaceflight experimentation. This approach provides key baseline comparisons to help understand the impact of ecotypic makeup on responses to spaceflight and so provide important background data for the design of future spaceflight experimentation using this widely adopted model plant.\nPreflight testing (Science and Payload Verification Tests) was successfully completed in 2014 and the payload of 4 BRIC canisters containing a total of twenty 60 mm Petri dishes, each containing 64 seeds, was launched on board SpaceX-CRS4. All on orbit operations were successfully completed and the frozen samples were returned via SpaceX's Dragon capsule, transported to Kennedy Space Center, de-integrated and shipped to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where RNA was successfully extracted and RNAseq transcriptome analysis performed. Six to eight replicate samples were isolated per type of plant. All samples were in the “excellent” range for all mission success criteria.\nRNAseq was used to monitor the levels of all genes in each sample. To robustly define the up- and down-regulated genes, we used the Tuxedo RNAseq computer analysis pipeline and then applied three separate normalization methods that apply different approaches to statistically assign significantly differentially expressed genes: DESeq, EdgeR, and CuffDiff2. Agreement between multiple analysis approaches provides increased confidence that they are faithfully extracting genes showing true changes in activity in the spaceflight samples. Additionally, we used strict 95% statistical significance cutoffs and false discovery rates to maintain stringent selection criteria, and further maximized confidence by looking for where all 3 of the three normalization approaches agreed that a gene was differentially expressed. By these criteria 1556 genes were significantly altered in the cml24 mutant backgrounds with an enrichment in heat shock proteins, that may represent an enhancement of a core spaceflight response system. In addition to alterations in mechanically-responsive genes, flight transcriptomes were seen to parallel those of plants on Earth that have been challenged with the pathogen defense elicitor molecules. Thus, there is significant overlap between the spaceflight and defense elicitor gene sets with, e.g., 19% of the genes altered in flight being associated with bacterial defense response on Earth. As the flight samples were maintained under strict sterile conditions and showed no bacterial or fungal contamination, these results suggest alteration in defense signaling may be one element of the spaceflight response in plants. A further finding from this analysis is that up- and down-regulated flight genes seen in wild-type plants are often even more significantly altered in the cml24-4 mutant (the loss of function mutant in the CML24 gene) and this response can be reversed in the cml24-2 mutant that shows irreversible activation on the CML24 gene. Overall what emerges from these analyses is a significant enrichment in defense- and mechanically-responsive genes in the spaceflight environment.\nParallel analysis of the multiple ecotypes flown under the Genelab component of this experiment indicated genes encoding heat shock proteins are up-regulated in response to spaceflight. Heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones that act in many stress response pathways in addition to temperature stress. At a cellular level, these proteins act to refold or remove other proteins damaged by environmental conditions and have been highlighted in previous spaceflight responses of Arabidopsis cell cultures. Further analysis indicates other related molecular chaperones that change in some, but not all, of the ecotypes, further emphasizing the link between chaperones and response to spaceflight. Importantly, data logger information from BRIC-19 showed that no thermal excursions from the ISS ambient of ~24°C occurred during the experiment indicating these transcripts are not simply reporting a heat shock event but suggesting upregulation of a broad stress-related machinery in response to some other aspect of the spaceflight environment. Spaceflight also led to down-regulation of classes of genes and prominent amongst these were enzymes of the peroxidase family that are involved in remodeling the plant cell wall. A role for these enzymes in spaceflight was previously highlighted in results from the BRIC16 experiment, suggesting alteration in cell wall structure may be a commonly occurring plant response to the spaceflight environment.\nGene ontology/classification analyses of these data further suggest response to oxidative stress is a major component of the core spaceflight stress network, a conclusion supported by gene network analysis, such as with the QTLNetminer tool. The raw gene expression data for these analyses has been deposited as GeneLab Data System-37.\nIn collaboration with Dr. Richard Morris at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK, work has also been conducted on modeling how reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ interact to propagate stress responses in plants. Using a combination of in vivo imaging of Ca2+ and ROS dynamics and analysis of responses in the AtRBOHD mutant (defective in the Respiratory Burst Homolog D enzyme responsible for producing many signaling-related changes in ROS), the role of this enzyme in ROS-assisted Ca2+-dependent stress signaling has been dissected. This quantitative analysis allowed Richard Morris to develop a math-based model to describe this phenomenon. The model predicts a role for AtRBOHD-dependent extracellular ROS production in cell-to-cell movement of stress information within the plant. Using measurements of responses to inhibitors of AtRBOHD, mutants, and quantitative imaging, the predictions of the model have been tested and the model validated.",

            "task_description": "The shaping of plant architecture is a process that unfolds over the entire lifespan of a plant and is continually informed by developmental and environmental cues. On Earth, the most pervasive and constant of these environmental cues is gravity. Gravity is an important factor in guiding how plant organs are organized in space. However, gravity does not only provide directional information during plant development. As growing plants gain size and mass, the increasing weight of vertical stems and laterally projecting branches and leaves results in progressive mechanical self-loading. These mechanical loads can lead to buckling or breaking of plant organs unless they are structurally reinforced.\nThe principal objective of this research proposal is to understand how mechanical loads are translated into developmental programs that maintain structural integrity of the plant body. Specifically, we will investigate the role of the plasma membrane receptor-like kinase FERONIA in this process, as we have recently discovered that FERONIA is crucial to normal mechanical signaling and mechanical development of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse Ear Cress). We will employ fluorescence microscopy, growth kinematics, and molecular biology approaches to investigate how FERONIA interacts with gravity and other mechanical signal transduction pathways.\nResults from such analyses are responsive to the goals of the NASA Research Announcement in addressing the fundamental question of how plants sense and react to gravity as a mechanical force to regulate growth and development. Understanding how FERONIA serves to help plants adapt under conditions of non-Earth-normal gravity may eventually provide a means for modulating mechanical strength in plants raised in microgravity conditions in the absence of mechanical self-load.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research addresses the question of how plants sense mechanical forces and how they utilize this information to modulate growth and tissue strength. Understanding how mechanical signaling, and specifically mechanical signaling through the receptor-like kinase FERONIA, affects the growth and development of plants will not only provide insight into how the reduced gravity environment of spaceflight will affect plant architecture, but will also have translational potential for improving plant agriculture on Earth. Understanding the mechanisms that enhance plant tissue strength may eventually yield molecular targets for the manipulation of traits that allow plants to withstand wind and to penetrate compacted soils."

            "task_progress": "The receptor-like kinase FERONIA is activated by binding its small secreted peptide ligand RALF1 (RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR1) but is also essential to mechanical signal transduction. To understand the role of FERONIA in mechanical signal transduction we have analyzed (1)  the effect of RALF1 on mechanosensitivity of Arabidopsis roots; (2) the effects of RALF1 and mechanical wounding on FERONIA subcellular localization; (3) mechanisms underlying FERONIA-dependent Ca2+ signaling. We have found that pretreatment with RALF1 peptides rapidly desensitizes FER-dependent mechanical Ca2+ signaling. We further observed that RALF1 triggers endocytosis and degradation of FERONIA via the endosomal pathway. In contrast, mechanical wounding also appears to elicit a loss of FERONIA from the plasma membrane, but via a different pathway. Finally, we found that FERONIA-dependent mechanical Ca2+ signaling requires the expression of a subset of CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNELS; the same channels are not essential for FERONIA-dependent RALF1-induced Ca2+ signaling. These results suggests that FERONIA may act as a dual function receptor or as a hub where RALF1 and mechanical signaling pathways (among others) are integrated.\nTo understand the role of FERONIA in regulating cell expansion, we have (1) assayed rapid growth responses to RALF1 using high-resolution kinematic analysis ; (2) analyzed FER-dependent changes in vacuolar morphology and cytoskeletal organization. We found that RALF1 triggers rapid growth inhibition in Arabidopsis roots in a FERONIA- and Ca2+ dependent manner. RALF1-induced growth inhibition is correlated with a reduction in cell extensibility as assayed  in osmotic inflation experiments. Osmotic inflation assays also indicate differences in wild type and feronia loss-of-function mutant cell extensibility. We further observed that RALF1 treatment triggers a rapid (within 10 minutes) change in vacuolar morphology that is associated with a concomitant change in actin cytoskeleton organization. These results are consistent with FERONIA signaling affeccting both cell wall extensibility and cell turgor to modulate growth.",

The proposed ISS-MO establishment will lead to long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics, addressing recommendation P1 of this solicitation. It will also provide answers to NASA Space Biology Guiding Questions CMM-1, CMM-4, and CMM-5.\nThe ISS-MO project's methodology will serve as the foundation for an extensive microbial census, offering significant insight into spaceflight-induced changes in the populations of beneficial and potentially harmful microbes. Additionally, it will provide NASA with both a mechanistic understanding of these changes (e.g., cataloging population changes and mapping/linking these to environmental niche and genomic changes), as well as insight into practical countermeasures for mitigating risks to humans and environmental systems.\nThe ISS-MO team will use existing ISS sample collection technologies to generate an initial microbial census. Following their return to Earth, samples from the various ISS modules will be analyzed using standardized technologies from the Mars Program-funded projects.\nThe proposed ISS-MO project includes the delivery of a database that compiles the genomic sequences and genetic information for all the microbes encountered within the ISS habitat. Using this data, NASA can more accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to providing microbial profiles, the ISS-MO team will identify which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health. Furthermore, specific ISS-MO project aims will enable us to resolve applicable NASA-Human Research Program integrated research plan risks.",

Subsequent microbiological analyses using traditional methods noticed no anomaly and were also not able to predict the causative microbial agents. The next-generation sequencing study provided NASA with the ability to assess the spectrum of microorganisms associated with the ISS surfaces and would help to predict possible microbial agents that might affect crew health. The results of the present study also exhibited presence of representative human associated (skin, gastrointestinal track, wounds, etc.) bacterial commensals and opportunistic fungal pathogens. Furthermore, based on the phylogenetic affiliation it is possible to determine whether these viable microorganisms are hardy and robust that have been previously reported to survive in oligotrophic environments (cleanrooms, hospital, commercial airliner, etc.). The study has improved our understanding of background microbial contamination, thus facilitating the development of biosensors to monitor closed habitats like ISS and future manned missions."

The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo and crew, that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. The NASA Space Biology program funded a study to catalogue ISS environmental microbiome (Microbial Tracking – 1; MT-1). Several defined locations were systematically collected from 3 consecutive flights and microbial census was generated using advanced molecular microbial community analysis “omics” techniques, supported by traditional culture-based methods. Similarly, an Inflated Lunar/Mars Analog Habitat as a ground control system and SpaceX CRS (Commercial Resupply Service) vehicles to trace source of any possible contamination were examined and results presented. The 3-year funded 5 year time period of the MT-1 experiments was completed and the information produced would serve as the foundation for an extensive microbial census, offering significant insight into spaceflight-induced changes in the populations of beneficial and potentially harmful microbes. The safety of crewmembers and the maintenance of hardware are the primary goals for monitoring microorganisms in this closed habitat.\nThis study provides the first comprehensive catalogue of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries. The outcomes of the MT-1 microbiome study presented here may enable the development of suitable countermeasure technologies allowing to eradicate problematic microorganisms for human habitation in space and in confined built environments on Earth (e.g., medical, pharmaceutical, and spacecraft cleanrooms). These data sets were placed in the NASA GeneLab that is open to the scientific research community to encourage innovation.",

            "task_description": "This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.\nIn a corollary set of experiments, we are utilizing next generation sequencing techniques to assess the effects of long term exposure to radiation on the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in a variety of model systems. The most comprehensive view of this process has come from yeast which, owing to the conservation of this essential pathway, shares homologs of their human DNA repair counterparts. A key observation from our group and others is that different types of DNA damage require unique repair genes and proteins. Accordingly,  we are studying the cellular response to energetic particle radiation experienced in space using whole genome sequencing of thousands of yeast cells exposed to a large matrix of space-specific conditions.\nWe hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.\nThe proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station (ISS); (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data; (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.\nTo test our hypothesis, we will:\n1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated microgravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.\n2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated microgravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme that is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.\n3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground-based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This work aims to understand the genetic control mechanism that controls the gene expression response to cellular responses to microgravity in yeast.\nYeast have 70% homolog with the human genome, and are a useful model system to define primary and secondary drug metabolism pathways that cannot be done in current mammalian cell culture systems.\nThe short term aim is to map the genetic promoter elements that mediate gene responses to microgravity. The long term goal is to use this information to unveil drug metabolism pathways in the unique metabolic environment provided by microgravity.\nWe propose to establish a sustained genomics platform on the ISS to understand the long term effects of the radiation, and other features of the ISS environment, on crew health by dissecting the essential processes of DNA damage and DNA repair. This has broad Earth benefits in understanding effects and optimization of medically necessary radiation therapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents.\nThe APEX-02-2 work  quantitatively measures radiation damage to yeast DNA exposed to space radiation. Using state of the art technologies, the science team can, for the first time, conduct a highly powered, genome wide analysis of mechanisms of radiation damage in space. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating space based radiation damage.\nBy using yeast strains to understand the effects of space based radiation stresses at the cellular level, a greater knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms at work in cells will be gained. A hallmark of radiation stresses is that they induce physiological responses; primary among them are DNA damage. As yeast is a model eukaryotic organism, DNA damage changes caused by radiation could lead to a greater understanding of these processes on Earth, thus benefiting all citizens. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating clinical radiation damage.\nYeast deletion project is a project to create data for a near-complete collection of gene-deletion mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each strain carries a precise deletion of one of the genes in the genome, and has been functionally characterized. We have now cloned the 6,000+ strains of the yeast deletion series into the background of 10 separate deletion clones of genes known to play a major role in responses to radiation damage."

There were zero defects in the SpaceX-11 flight operations and experiment execution.\nSample processing by DNA extraction, a PCR amplification of reporter barcodes, next generation sequencing, and gene set enrichment analysis are complete. The final Cytoscope/Cluego visualization and probability modeling are ongoing.\nThe resources provided have allowed us to address the unifying hypothesis in a sophisticated and nuanced manner, with some important caveats for countermeasures. Our hypothesis is that cells cope with the stress associated with the microgravity of space environment by selectively changing the expression of specific target genes and this response is mediated by defined transcription factors. We have been able to determine specific target genes and mechanistic pathways determining them, including transcription factors, in a variety of space based models using background deletion of several radiation protection genes, as well as stimulation of the system with multiple drugs. In particular, we can now address whether metformin, a drug originally utilized in diabetes, but shown to have cancer protective properties, may be a useful radiation countermeasure. In this manner, the work directly addresses multiple Space Biology Science Plan's research goals, objectives, and guiding questions.\nAll OMICS data will be annotated and deposited in the NASA GeneLab portal.",

            "task_description": "The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e., primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g., mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on Earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA (NASA Research Announcement) because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research will provide a deeper understanding of how microgravity influences plant development. The focus of this research will be on the development of roots and how they modify the expression of their genes to adapt to the microgravity environment of spaceflight.\nThis research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of their cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature to overcome the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth."

Malfunction of the ABRS hardware on the ISS, de-manifestation from Space X-3, and delays in the launch of Space X-5 were set-backs we encountered during the first two years of the grant. However, we were able to overcome these early problems and completed most of the specific aims that we proposed. A major accomplishment of this proposal was the implementation of a simple method to delay germination of Arabidopsis seeds until experimental activation in space. We foresee that many in the plant space biology community will benefit from these methods. Another direct outcome of this grant is the discovery of novel plant proteins involved in modulating the cytoskeleton. These results have been published in high impact peer-reviewed publications.\nWe also successfully retrieved material from ground- and space-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. Processing and data analysis from these spaceflight experiments have been completed. We have deposited raw RNA-Seq data from our spaceflight work to the NASA GeneLab site but these have not yet been publicly released. During this funding period, we also completed glycomic studies of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in space and compared them with the corresponding ground controls. Both the transcriptomics (i.e., RNA-Seq) and glycomics results will be submitted this year for peer-review.\nTaken together, our RNA-Seq and glycomics results continue to point to the spaceflight environment as a major trigger for oxidative stress responses in plants. Our results suggest that the ideal plant ideotype for future space habitats could be similar to those that have been developed for marginal agricultural lands on Earth including crops tolerant to low oxygen (e.g., hypoxia) and other stressors (drought, insect resistance) as well as those with more robust cell wall mechanical properties. Such findings could be the bases of future spaceflight experiments wherein performance of plants with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress can be evaluated on hardware such as the advanced plant habitat (APH) or the Spectrum.",

            "task_description": "Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.\nPlants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development, and reduces yield.\nIn animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).\nIn all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast (8-10) and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.\nWe believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.\nWe also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.\nWe also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.\nIn conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.\nREFERENCES\n1.

These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to a variety of plant cellular stress responses. We successfully completed both of the preflight tests (science verification test (SVT) and experiment verification test (EVT)) to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the plant samples returned from BRIC-22. On August 14, 2017 our experiment was launched on board the SpaceX-12 ISS resupply mission and was successfully executed by ISS astronauts. The samples were preserved on orbit and underwent atmospheric reentry on board the same Dragon capsule in September of 2017. At the same time a duplicate of the experiment was grown at the Kennedy Space Center using temperature conditions which were matched to the flight conditions. We extracted RNA from both sets of samples and performed RNA sequencing in order to better understand what genes would be turned on and off specifically by spaceflight conditions in wild type plants and our mutant plants. We observed changes in the way that thousands of genes were activated in response to these conditions between flight and ground conditions and are submitting our results for peer review.\nMeanwhile, further research on these stress regulating genes and the Arabidopsis mutants that were tested in BRIC-22 is also being completed in continuing ground-based studies. Through a better understanding of these gene’s function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses.",

            "task_description": "Yeast chemical genomics is a powerful tool that is being applied to drug discovery.  This approach allows the study of compound-target relationships in the context of a living cell with a systems biology view that includes both the cell target and the interdependent networks that respond to chemical stress. The modulation of yeast colonies, especially the redox potential, allows study of different drug pathways.\nThis application investigates microbial metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast.  Our previous work has largely defined yeast cellular stress defense response to microgravity, but stress defense responses are only involved in the survival of yeast in liquid cultures.  It has recently been found that survival of plate-based yeast colonies is dependent on signaling mediated through ammonia which drives the multicellular yeast colony to differentiate into two populations, L or lower cells and U or upper cells.  These two populations have different metabolic pathways and establish a cycle of nutrients that allows the U cells to continue to proliferate at the leading edge.  Without ammonia signaling, the entire colony dies. Lack of convection in space is likely to dramatically impact signaling by ammonia, a volatile gas. We postulate that the flow of nutrient and ammonia signals will differ in microgravity where there is little to no convection. We hypothesize that yeast colony survival in microgravity depends on ammonia mediated metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation rather than on stress defense. To test our hypothesis, we will identify the mechanisms mediating colony stratification into U and L cells under multiple gravitational environments: microgravity emulated by Rotating Wall Vessel and Random Positioning Device, static one g cultures, and ultimately microgravity of space flight. Our experimental model will compare liquid and solid phase yeast cultures and make use of available mutant strains of yeast with deletion of the enzymes involved in ammonia signaling and the connected alternative metabolism activation, enzymes involved in stress responses, and the Msn4 promoter and SSA4 gene that we have previously identified as mediating response to microgravity.  Relevant metabolic pathways will be studied using green fluorescent protein-linked reporter genes that can be analyzed by confocal microscopy of intact colonies, and flow cytometry of cells divided into L and U populations by sucrose density centrifugation. There are similarities between multicellular yeast colonies and tumors of clusters of mammalian cells in tissue culture.  Thus insights into the effect of microgravity on cell to cell signaling may have far-reaching applications.\nMicrogravity could provide a physiologically responsive test bed for drug pathway analysis at diverse redox states.",

            "task_progress": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al. 2014; Kachroo et al. 2015; Nislow et al. 2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al. 2009a; Ayer et al. 2014; Herker et al. 2004). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based colonies (Cap et al. 2009a). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colony is dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification of the population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling (Cap et al. 2009a). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays using a deletion series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small molecules in vivo including chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al. 2010). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colony on solid agar models many of the changes seen within solid tumors (Cap et al. 2009a, 2010, 2012a, d).\nYeast is also a popular model for studies of cellular responses to microgravity and microgravity simulations. Multiple flight experiments have verified that S. cerevisiae remains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism [e.g., increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and Volz 1979) and phenotype [e.g., increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al. 1996)]. Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responses of liquid culture yeast to real (e.g., space flight) microgravity and simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a, b; Hammond et al. 1999; Johanson et al. 2002; Nislow et al. 2015). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role in the responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al. 2015). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al. 2008a).\nThe first steps in this initiative were to validate assays for reactive oxygen species and glutathione in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during microgravity simulation.\nThe effects of space flight on yeast have high concordance with agents that induce a very low intracellular redox state, and induce a massive efflux of glutathione. These results raise important issues. Can the reduced redox state during space flight be reproduced and modulated in ground-based simulations? Will this allow definition of unique drug pathways, as a low redox state mirrors the electrophilic properties of mitochondria, where many drugs are metabolized? Unfortunately, assays for redox status and its major cellular determinant, glutathione, are diverse, often cell type specific, and we lack an accepted probe set for yeast studies. This paper validates fluorescent probes for glutathione and reactive oxygen status in yeast to support mechanistic studies of microgravity and drug metabolism. The plethora of fluorescent reagents for reactive oxygen species and glutathione can be bewildering, and makes head-to-head comparisons of all the alternatives impractical. These reagents measure the physiological milieu of reactive oxygen species and diverse thiols, rather than specific individual molecules. We report that in yeast, monochlorobimane (mBCL) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DC-FDA) are suitable for fluorometric and flow cytometry studies of glutathione and reactive oxygen species, respectively. Both dyes have low background fluorescence, predictable loading, good retention, and are non-toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both dyes show concordance with other fluorescent and biochemical assays of reactive oxygen species.\nThe second step in this initiative was to establish the timing, optimal media (rich versus poor) a dynamic range of rotational interventions for low redox potential in giant yeast colonies.  Giant yeast colonies develop a low redox potential, which mimics the electrophilic milieu of both the mitochondrial drug metabolizing compartment, and the hypoxic core of many tumors. The major metabolic mediators of this low redox potential include ATP, glutathione, NAD+/NADH, and NADP+/NADPH. Ammonia signaling is the critical mechanism that induces stratification of the giant yeast colonies to allow a low redox potential. Comparison of two powerful investigative models for drug pathways using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been compounded by the use of different growth media and stimuli to the system. Chemogenetic profiling, which uses a pool of yeast deletion mutants to determine survival changes, is heavily slanted to the use of rich media. Giant yeast colonies studies are heavily slanted to the use of poor media. The current study answers three questions. First, what are the differences in redox potential and its major metabolic mediators in giant yeast colonies over time? Metabolic status is assayed as glutathione content, redox potential, ATP content, and ratios of NAD to NADH and NADP to NADPH. Second, how does rich versus poor media affect physiological responses of giant yeast colonies? Third, how does clinorotation affect redox potential and its metabolic mediators? Clinorotation is of interest because it randomizes the gravitational vector. That in turn should disrupt the convection-medicated ammonia signaling known to drive giant yeast colony stratification and differentiation. This study demonstrates that the low redox potential status in tumors and drug metabolizing areas of mitochondria can be reproduced in giant yeast colonies grown on both poor and rich media. The study defines the time course and effects of middle molecule mediators from glutathione and ATP to the NAD family of mediators. Rotation proved to be a potent way to selectively modulate ammonia signaling, redox potential, and metabolic mediators.\nThe third step in this initiative was to determine if lack of convection of gaseous ammonia in true microgravity changes the stratification and expansion of in giant yeast models of differentiation and tumorgenesis.\nLittle is known about the effects of space flight on yeast growing as a colony on agar. On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al. 2009b, 2012b, c). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly, thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity driven convection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeast colony differentiation (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). It is not known how the absence of convection seen in microgravity might affect this process.\nTo answer this question, we studied giant yeast colonies formed in true microgravity (i.e., space flight) and in two ground-based simulations of microgravity: rotation and random positioning. Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during space flight (Hammond and Hammond 2001; Lee et al. 2014; Birdsall et al. 2016). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cells and gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al. 2016). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of ‘gravity-vector-averaging’, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al. 2014). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and true microgravity (Grimm et al. 2014), and controversy as to whether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al. 2004; Murdoch et al. 2013; Wuest et al. 2017).\nMetabolic adaption in giant yeast colonies is triggered by the depletion of nutrients in the agar and to enhance this process colonies are typically grown on nutrient-poor agar (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). In contrast, studies of yeast in liquid cultures, including chemical genomic assays, tend to use rich media. To evaluate the role of nutrients, we conducted parallel studies of yeast on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient poor (YE) media.\nThree major analyzes were conducted in yeast grown as giant colonies under true and simulated microgravity. First, we measured the expression of a series of genes likely to be affected by microgravity using clones engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Table 1 lists the clones used and the rationale for their selection. ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies (Cap et al. 2012a, d). BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in space flight (Walther et al. 1996). TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox (Birdsall et al. 2016; Cap et al. 2012d) and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species (Trotter and Grant 2005). EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect (Kshirsagar and Parker 2004).  Second, we evaluated the dependence of two stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, on the stress promoters, Msn4 and Sfp1 (Johanson et al. 2002). We have previously shown that in liquid yeast cultures, SSA4 and RPL34b have novel transcription dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 during space flight that differs from ground-based controls (Coleman et al. 2008a).\nThird, we evaluated the viability and induction of apoptosis in the giant yeast colonies and the dependence of these outcomes on the stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1. The differentiation of giant yeast colonies in terrestrial analyzes is dependent on the promoters Msn4 and Sfp1 (Cap et al. 2012b) but the effects of microgravity on this process are not known.\n100 µ l of stationary culture inocula of each yeast strain were placed in 5 ml of fresh YPD or YE media and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 30°C. Omniwell plates prefilled with 40ml of YE or YPD agar were spotted with 60 µ l of the overnight liquid culture with forty-eight spots per plate. To minimize dehydration after drying the Omniwell lids were sealed to the base with Durapore tape and the plates were placed in plastic Ziploc™ bags. The plates were cooled to 4°C and were divided into five sets of four plates - one set for each of the five growth conditions. Each set contained a full series on YPD agar and a full series on YE agar.\nFlight and static ground control plates were sent to Kennedy Space Center in chilled shipping containers. Just prior to flight, working in a cold room, the plates were transferred to barcoded Ziploc™ bag and stacks of eight were placed in Lexan bags and then into plate habitats (PHABs;\nhttp://www-bioserve.colorado.edu/tech_Sheets_pdfs/SelectBioServeHardware.pdf\n; BioServe Space Technologies, CO). The PHAB is a sealed container that allows for gas exchange but meets NASA safety requirements for levels of containment. (\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/life_support_systems/crew_payload/index.html\n). PHABs were placed in cold bags at 4°C, and remained chilled for five days during handoff to the SpaceX-8 rocket. Flight samples were flown to the International Space Station (ISS). Approximately two days post-launch, the growth of the yeast on ISS was initiated by transferring the PHABs to Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4 (CGBA4) (Hoehn et al. 2004) that was set to 30°C (BioServe Space Technologies, CO). After 28 days in flight, CGBA4 was commanded down to +4°C. The following day the PHABs were moved back to cold bags, and returned to Earth the next day on the Dragon capsule. Plates remained chilled for a total of six days during undocking, return to Earth, salvage, and transport to the lab for flow cytometry analysis.\nThe second set of plates, the static flight controls were loaded into a second set of PHABs at Kennedy Space Center and handled to match the exact timing and temperature profile of the flight samples. Ground controls were conducted with a 24-hour offset relative to the flight samples and the static controls in PHABs followed the same temperature changes as the flown samples.\nA third and fourth set of samples were subjected to Wall-Vessel rotation or random positioning (RPM) during growth. The timing of the rotating and RPM cultures matched that of the flight samples with the exception that they were grown at ambient laboratory conditions (25°C) rather than 30°C and they were not placed in PHABs. To control for the difference, an additional set of static ground controls were maintained in plastic bags at 25°C and also not placed in PHABs. Results from the two set of static controls, PHABs/30°C versus no-PHAB/25°C, did not differ (Pearson correlation >95%) so data from the two were pooled in the statistical analyzes. Similarly, we could not detect any differences due to plate position of the replication using any of the modalities studied (Pearson correlation >95%).\nWe have previously reported on the effects of media and rotation on the viability and redox potential in giant yeast colonies in ground-based studies (Birdsall et al. 2016). In this report, we extend analysis to include giant yeast colonies in the true microgravity of space flight as well as in the microgravity simulation by random positioning (RPM) and 2D rotation (Rotating Wall-Vessel head) positioning. Defining the utility of microgravity and microgravity simulations is confounded by use of different microgravity simulations, different media, and different outcomes. This study is a systematic examination of the effects of true microgravity versus common microgravity simulations, and nutrient rich media versus nutrient poor media, on major mechanistic mediators including shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. This lays the ground work for future yeast experiments to study cell-to-cell interactions, cell signaling, cell survival, colony differentiation and aging, mechanisms of drug action, and characteristics of tumor generation.\nCell death by necrosis and apoptosis increased in flight as shown by multiple modalities: uptake of propidium iodide up, expression of caspase, and binding of annexin V. Induction of apoptosis by simulated microgravity has been seen with other cell types including human lymphocytes (Ward et al. 2006). This increased cell death was greatly increased by deletion of either of the stress responsive promoters Msn4 or Sfp1. The finding of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is further evidence for activity of both ammonia signaling and stress defense pathways, as ammonia signaling utilizes mostly caspase independent pathways (Vachova and Palkova 2005) and stress defense is mediated mostly by apoptosis as well as autophagy and necrosis (Farrugia and Balzan 2012).\nThe changes in INO1 and SSA4 genes are significant in both random positioning with gravity vector averaging and rotation techniques but oppositely directed to the space flight changes, underscoring the uniqueness of the effects of true microgravity. During culture on the ISS, yeast cultures are also exposed to increased radiation (Nislow et al. 2015). Our previous studies using yeast deletion series in liquid culture to evaluate the effects of space flight revealed two dominant responses: radiation/DNA repair and reactive oxygen pathways (Nislow et al. 2015). We conclude that the ISS provides a unique suite of stimuli with distinct set of responses: the question is how to translate these properties to i) further NASA’s program objectives, ii) support commercial development, and iii) address unmet clinical needs.  We found differences in the responses of yeast in the rotating wall vessel versus random positioning models in both ammonia-dependent and stress-dependent changes, providing clarity to the controversy as to whether the random positioning device is a form of rotation, or a distinct stimulus (Klaus 2001; Klaus et al. 2004). These differences included gene expression changes mediated by shear stress promoters, redox status, and apoptosis. Hence, we conclude that the forces induced by random positioning and rotation are distinct. Many resources are available for scientists seeking to study the effects of gravity on biologic systems (Brungs et al. 2016; Frett et al. 2016) and researchers should be mindful that fluidity of the culture milieu and shear stress at the membrane surface are likely to be important variables affecting how cells sense gravity (Kohn et al. 2017; van Loon 2008). In our model system composed of a near-solid colony of yeast, receiving nutrients from an agar gel at its base, and using a gas, ammonia, as one means of driving differentiation within the colony, space flight, rotating wall vessel and random positioning generate different effects. In free-floating liquid systems such as U937 cells growing in suspension (Bradamante et al. 2006), HUVEC cells adherent to Cytodex beads (Bradamante et al. 2006), or thyroid cells growing as spheroids (Warnke et al. 2016) rotating wall vessel, random positioning machines, and space flight had very similar effects.\nThe ability of physical methods to manipulate yeast colony redox, apoptosis, and stress defense status is important at multiple levels of organismal biology. Gene deletion, although targeted to a single locus, will often cause follow-on effects in multiple integrated pathways, especially when promoters are deleted (Park et al. 2011). Further, there are clinically important applications. Analysis of yeast survival pathways offers powerful techniques to address drug metabolic mechanisms for repurposing of pharmaceuticals (Lee et al. 2014), including identification of unique targets (Blackman et al. 2012) and buffering pathways required to respond to drugs. Further, yeast colony differentiation recapitulates many of the stratification mechanisms of tumorigenesis (Cap et al. 2012a, d; Birdsall et al. 2016). In conclusion, by allowing graded manipulation of a combination of convection and ammonia signaling, while avoiding secondary effects of gene deletion, these physical techniques are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.  The fourth step in this initiative was to determine the gene pathways, which mediate space based changes in giant yeast colony differentiation as a tumorogenesis model.\nOur data shows that space flight on the ISS appeared to have a unique pattern on DNA damage.  The logical next step is to combine this genome sequencing data with functional data in order to investigate the biological consequence(s) of deleting a particular genes and the subsequent accumulation of mutations.\nThe hypothesis to be tested is that yeast double deletion pools can be used to identify genes conferring resistance to space/cosmic radiation.\nThe traditional approach is to create double mutants that contain combinations of each mutation of interest (the query mutation) with a mutation in a second gene (Dixon et al., 2009).  This experimental approach exploits the phenomenon of synthetic lethality in which a combination of mutations in two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a mutation in only one of these genes is not, in itself, lethal.  Synthetic lethality is currently of great interest in the study of cancer.  Synthetic lethality can help us understand how cells become cancerous by overcoming the redundant cellular quality control mechanisms.  It can also be a potential way to selectively kill cancer cells by identifying drugs that can target and inactivate synthetic lethal genes that act in concert with cancer-driver genes. Our previous radiation work in space has not addressed synthetic lethality at all.\nWe generated double mutant libraries in which the mutated DNA repair gene (mutation #1) is paired with a homozygous deletion of another yeast gene (mutation #2).  Each pool contains approximately ˜ 4600 double-mutant strains, representing deletion of each of the nonessential genes in the yeast genome combined with mutation #1. In “fitness profiling” the mutants were grown and the relative quantity of each clone was measured (Roemer et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010).  The samples were flown cold to the ISS, allowed to grow while exposed to cosmic radiation on station, and returned to ground.  Recent innovations in sample preparation allowed us to fly these experiments at ambient temperatures, which required minimal crew input to initiate the experiment, and produced a small payload. Furthermore, because the experiment was limited by nutrient availability (e.g., the yeast grow until the nutrients are depleted then remain in a quiescent state), the experimental set up is a closed system that did not require any additional intervention or specialized post-experiment storage requirements. Finally, the generation of these double mutant pools provides sufficient stock material for ~5000 ground based follow-on experiments using the sample aliquots, and can be stored indefinitely.\nTo prepare the second mutation in each clone, both copies of each of the ˜ 4600 nonessential genes in the yeast genome is removed by genetic engineering.  The mutated clone is able to thrive so long as there is no external stressor targeting that particular gene’s protein.  However, in the presence of the stressor (e.g., cosmic radiation), the clone is overwhelmed and grows less well compared to clones with irrelevant mutations.  To discriminate the clones in the series, each clone’s deleted gene has been replaced with a unique DNA bar code.  The entire series can be grown together in the presence of the stressor, the DNA extracted, and the numbers of each clone quantified by high throughput sequencing or hybridization to gene chips (Smith et al., 2010).  The ‘clone-identifying’ barcode is unique to each clone, but the insert is flanked by up and down DNA sequences that are identical in every clone so that the extracted DNA for all clones can be amplified together.  All of the techniques proposed have been used and validated in space flight (Johanson et al., 2007; Nislow et al., 2015).\nMultiple double mutation pools were prepared corresponding to sentinel DNA-sensitive mutant strains. These pools were made robotically, rapidly, and inexpensively (Giaever and Nislow, 2014).    The result of the chemogenomic assay is a quantitative metric, termed \"fitness\", presented as a list of genes ranked in order of their importance for growth and survival in the presence versus the absence of the stressor (space flight/cosmic radiation vs ground).  Accordingly a ranked list of all genes in the genome was generated for each experiment and then compared using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to define those pathways and processes that were affected by growth in microgravity using Cytoscape (Wallace et al., 2011).\nDetecting differentially fit genes from next generation sequencing or microarray data involves a set of statistical tradeoffs. Standard methods look for genes by relying on elementary test statistics using data from one gene at a time (such as t-tests, or contrasts from ANOVA models). Gene lists are obtained by filtering statistics by attempting to control overall type-I error, or false discovery rate, or by filtering using a user specified cutoff level. The tradeoff between controlling Type I errors, due to the large number of comparisons, and maintaining power can be handled in a variety of ways. These methods include but are not limited to False Discovery Rate analysis including Storey statistics, Bayesian analysis, and many other mapping techniques.\nSpecific comparisons provide internal controls. We were able to identify most of the nonessential genes previously shown to be involved in nucleotide excision repair, in cell cycle checkpoints, in homologous recombination, and in post replication repair after other forms of radiation damage. This validates the space-based assay by acting as a positive control.\nSecond, comparison is being made of the ISS data to existing data sets in this model  on UV irradiation, alkayating radiomimetic agents, and our prior ISS data. Especially in the deletion pool using the wild type background, this should elucidate if the changes in space have unique pathways.\nThe experiments performed in space flight and ground-based controls directly address Human Research Program and Space Biology Science Plan's research goals, objectives, and guiding questions that underlie our project's unifying hypothesis: \"Microgravity-induced changes in yeast are induced, at least in part, through changes in density driven ammonia convection and the subsequent effects on Msn4- and Sfp1-dependent genetic and cellular differentiation of giant yeast colonies.\"  Each experiment is identifying specific target genes and the transcription factors that mediate the changes using reporter synthetic genetic array methodology or gene expression.\nThe Micro 9 experiment flew on SpaceX-8, spending one month on the ISS.  There were zero defects in either the ISS or parallel ground control experiments.  All four experiments included static and rotated ground controls.  Experiments 3 and 4, ground controls with a random positioning machine, were also conducted.\nExperiment 1.  Evaluate the role of ammonia and reactive oxygen species in the response to space flight using synthetic gene array technology.    \tThe yeast deletion series were prepared in a background of suppressed thioredoxin reductase activity (TRR1DAmp).  Thioredoxin reductase is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species.  Yeast deletion series were also prepared in a background of deleted SOK2, so that they are unable to synthesize ammonia, a key signaling molecule in the biochemical differentiation of giant yeast colonies.  Responses in these series were compared to yeast deletions series in a wild type background.\nIndividual clones were spotted on rich agar for fitness profiling.  Pools of each series were also spotted on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor agar as nutrient status affects generation of reactive oxygen species.  The agars were prepared with and without addition of the DNA-damaging agent 0.1 mM doxorubicin, as an additional stressor.\nExperiment 2:  Evaluate the response to space flight with radiation-sensitive clones.    \tEach of the 26 rad deletion addresses a different DNA damage response with different specific target gene and transcription factor responses in ground-based studies.\nExperiment 3: Evaluate the role of Sfp1 and Msn4 transcription factors in the expression of SSA4 and RPL34B by giant yeast colonies grown in real and emulated microgravity.  \teGFP-expressing SSa4 (YER103W) and  RPL34B clones with and without deletion of Msn4 & Sfp1 transcription factors were used.  RPL34B and SSa4 were selected because  we had previously found that their dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 is altered in microgravity in liquid cultures.  Specific clones were:  Ssa4 (YER103W); Sfp1 delta Ssa4; Msn4 delta Ssa4; RPL34B (YIL052c); Sfp1 delta RPL34B; Msn4 delta RPL34B.  Yeast were evaluated for shear stress gene expression, cell death, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry.\nExperiment 4:  Evaluate the expression of genes in giant yeast colonies grown in real and simulated microgravity.    \teGFP-expressing yeast clones were spotted on nutrient rich and nutrient poor agar.  Yeast were evaluated for shear stress gene expression, cell death, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry.\nThe rationale for the clones selected is as follows:  ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies.  BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in space flight.  TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species.  EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect.\nFor all samples, DNA has been extracted, the reporting bar codes have been amplified by PCR, and sequencing libraries prepared.  Next generation sequencing has been completed, as has initial analyses by Gene Set enrichment Analysis (GSEA).  Visualization and probability modeling by Cytoscape and ClueGO is ongoing.\nAll OMICS data will be annotated and deposited in the NASA GeneLab portal.\nReferences\nAyer, A., Gourlay, C.W., Dawes, I.W.: Cellular redox homeostasis, reactive oxygen species and replicative ageing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

            "task_description": "Single-celled spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii respond within seconds to both the direction and magnitude of gravity stimuli by altering the direction and magnitude of a trans-cell Ca2+ current that is required for the gravity response. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which gravity alters the trans-cell current, and identify key signaling steps that link the current to cellular polarity changes directed by gravity. This focus on gravity signaling addresses an overarching question in the Space Biology Science Plan. Ca2+-uptake channels and Ca2+-ATPase efflux pumps drive the Ca2+ current across spore cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of genes and proteins highly expressed in spores at the peak of the Ca2+ current have identified likely candidates for the pumps and channels. Immunological approaches and yeast-based activity assays will be used to determine whether these transporters are localized on the plasma membrane and are regulated post-translationally. Recent evidence indicates that extracellular eATP [eATP], a newly discovered signaling agent, helps control the gravity response in Ceratopteris, just as it helps regulate gravitropism in Arabidopsis roots. Because eATP controls the activity of Ca2+ channels in plants, we will test the regulatory link between eATP and the activity of Ca2+ channels that is crucial for the gravity response in Ceratopteris. Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulins, annexins, and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases are highly expressed in Ceratopteris at the peak of the Ca2+ current. They are the most likely signal transducers that help mediate the downstream cell polarization events guided by gravity, and their regulatory role in the gravity response will be tested. Expected results will generate hypotheses that predict molecular responses likely to occur in Ceratopteris cells in response to the micro-g environment, and the proposal will describe International Space Station (ISS) experiments that could test these predictions.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The germinating spore of Ceratopteris is an especially valuable model system for studying the cellular bases of gravity-induced graviresponses on Earth, because both the sensing of gravity and the response occur in the same cell. The cellular level mechanisms of sensory responses are very similar in plant and animal cells, thus the bottom-to-top Ca2+ current that develops early during spore germination as one of the first polarized events induced by gravity in the cell may be an early event also in animal cells known to respond to gravity, such as muscle and bone cells. Our investigation into candidate molecules likely to be associated with both the efflux and influx phases of this current will help clarify how this current is controlled. A number of studies have documented the importance of Ca2+ currents for polarized growth in both animal and plant cells; however, there are few prior studies that have identified and analyzed the molecular components of these currents. Moreover, while it is generally accepted that Ca2+ is a second messenger that participates in a myriad of plant and animal sensory responses, there is still little known about the molecular identity of the Ca2+ channels that mediate many of these responses, especially responses to gravitational stimuli. The proposed tests of Ca2+ pump and channel function and regulation, including possibly channel regulation by eATP, will not only provide novel insights into how the gravity-directed Ca2+ current originates, but also further advance an understanding of channel structures. The results will set the stage for future assays of post-translational changes that occur during space flight in the Ca2+-ATPase pumps and/or mechanosensitive channels in fern and possibly also in some animal cells when the transporter activities go from near zero in micro-gravity to quite high as the g-force rises to 2-g or higher levels achieved during parabolic flight or on a centrifuge on the International Space Station (ISS)."

            "task_progress": "The specific aim of the novel research proposed was to discover the molecular bases of rapid gravity responses in single spore cells of the fern Ceratopteris richardii. The approach to achieve this goal was to identify from recently obtained transcriptomic data molecular components that would be likely to drive the calcium current that is rapidly modulated by gravity. This would then allow an assessment of  post-transcriptional signaling changes in these components that are both induced by gravity and needed for subsequent, gravity-directed polarity changes in cell division and growth. Prior literature suggests many of the post-transcriptional changes induced by gravity in single Ceratopteris cells are similarly induced in multi-cellular organs of flowering plants, so the findings of this project are likely to have relevance to gravitational studies in the more complex tissues of higher plants. Expected findings from the proposed studies would predict rapid molecular-level changes that will be induced in the micro-g environment, and testing the validity of these predictions in Space Flight experiments will be both feasible and likely to provide valuable new insights on the systems life uses to sense and react to gravity.\nOne of the goals of Aim 1 of the original proposal was to molecularly identify cation transporters that could play a major role in driving the trans-cell calcium current that is directed by gravity in fern spores cells. In accord with this goal, we obtained the full-length sequence of a putative MscS (mechanosensitive channel, small current) gene, and obtained evidence in support of the conclusion that it actually has Msc activity by showing that it could partially rescue a bacterial knockout of Msc.  We also obtained partial sequences of two other Msc candidates in Ceratopteris that will serve as the basis to design primers that can “walk” through the Ceratopteris transcriptome and genome to obtain their full sequences, and the primary sequences of the proteins they encode. This will enable the production of antibodies that can be used to identify where each of the Msc channels is localized. If any of these candidates prove to be mechanosensitive channels on the plasma membrane, it (or they) would be the one(s) most likely to undergo post-translational modifications by gravity stimulation.\nThe goal of Aim 2 of the original proposal was to test the role of genes encoding Ca2+-binding proteins that are expressed at the peak of the trans-cell Ca2+ current by suppressing or overexpressing their transcription using transformation methods. We have successfully generated transgenic Ceratopteris spores expressing one of several different transgenes, and these spores will be valuable tools for genetically dissecting gravity responses in spores that respond to gravity while they are still single cells. The mutants include one expressing the calcium reporter Yellow Cameleon, which will enable assessing gravity-induced changes in [Ca2+]cyt; one constitutively expressing a spore annexin, which is a calcium-binding protein implicated in regulating calcium channels in plasma membranes, one suppressed in annexin expression; one knocked down in expression of the Ca2+ATPase pump that helps drive the gravity-induced trans-cell calcium current;  and one knocked down in one of the mechanosensitive ion channels described above in the paragraph on Aim 1. Generating these mutants and genetically confirming their mutant status required over two years of ground-breaking research, and the transgenic products are the first (and still the only) fern mutants modified in spore-expressed genes.\nWe made the most progress on Aim 3 of the original proposal, which was to test the role of eATP in promoting the critical Ca2+-uptake step of the spore gravity response. Key background information that provides the rationale for this goal is that when gravity directs the polarization of Ceratopteris fern spores this process begins with the uptake of calcium through channels at the bottom of the spore, and this step is necessary for the gravity response. Data from several different laboratories showing that extracellular ATP (eATP) regulates calcium channels in plants and animals led to the hypothesis that extracellular nucleotides could play a role in the gravity-directed polarization of Ceratopteris spores. In animal and plant cells ATP can be released from mechanosensitive channels.\nThe idea that a differential distribution of a signaling molecule could lead to morphological polarity is not unique. In this regard, gradients of the growth hormone auxin are among the best documented to be inductive of cell polarity in plants. The differential distribution of eATP during gravity-directed polarization could be an early step in a series of asymmetrical molecular events that ultimately lead to the downstream cellular and morphological changes needed to generate a gravity-directed, downward growing rhizoid in Ceratopteris spores. Precedent data relevant to this hypothesis are those of Tang et al. (Wenqiang Tang, Shari R. Brady, Yu Sun, Gloria K. Muday, and Stanley J. Roux.  Extracellular ATP Inhibits Root Gravitropism at Concentrations That Inhibit Polar Auxin Transport. Plant Physiol. 2003 131: 147-154.) in the journal Plant Physiology, who showed that a high [eATP] inhibits the gravity response in Arabidopsis roots. They interpreted their data as evidence that an eATP gradient could be one of the first steps involved in the gravity response in plant cells. These data led us to test whether gravity could induce a gradient of eATP between the top and bottom of germinating fern spores, and, if so, whether this gradient could help mediate the gravity effect of directing the polarization of the spores.\nIn order to carry out this test, an ATP biosensor, developed by the McLamore laboratory at the University of Florida, was used to measure the [eATP] at the bottom and top of germinating spores during gravity-directed polarization. This biosensor could quantify eATP levels down to the low nM range, and it has a tip diameter of only 1-2 µm, much smaller than the 100-120 µm diameter of spore cells. Using this unique tool with a micromanipulator that could guide the probe to within a few microns of the spore surface, we made the exciting discovery that the [eATP] along the bottom of the spore averaged 7-fold higher than the concentration at the top. Treatments that disrupted the gradient, such as flooding the medium with ATP, or that antagonized eATP receptors, such as adding the ATP receptor blocker PPADS to the medium, or that hydrolyzed ATP in the medium, such as by the addition of phosphatase enzymes, all resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the gravity response. In order to investigate the source of ATP release, spores were treated with Brefeldin A (BFA), which would block cellular secretory activity, and gadolinium trichloride (GdCl3), which would block the transport activity of the mechanosensitive channels that release ATP into the extracellular medium. These treatments resulted in a significant decrease in gravity-directed polarization.\nThe same eATP biosensor was also used to measure ATP release after treatment with both BFA and GdCl3. Both of these treatments caused a significant decrease in [ATP] measured around spores. These results supported the hypothesis that ATP could be released from mechanosensitive channels and secretory vesicles during gravity-directed polarization.\nThe novel findings described above show a clear role for eATP in gravity-directed polarization of Ceratopteris spores by documenting that gravity can induce a bottom-to-top gradient of extracellular ATP around the spores, and that this gradient promotes gravity-directed polarization of the spores. They provide support for the hypothesis that mechanosensitive channels, which have been implicated in other reports as critical components of gravity responses, can help generate eATP gradients that can enhance a cellular gravity response. Overall, they reveal that quantifying and evaluating gradients of eATP can lead to a more thorough understanding of how plants use ATP release to direct growth and development.\nProduction of the novel self-referencing biosensor used to document the gravity-induced eATP gradient between the top and bottom of vertically-oriented spore cells would not have been possible without support from this NASA grant. Recognizing that this biosensor would be a valuable research tool for investigating other eATP-regulated phenomena not only in ferns but also in higher plants, we used it to assay [eATP] levels around growth zones of primary roots of Arabidopsis, because previous research had indicated cells release ATP as they grow. We also used the probe to evaluate whether changing the expression of two apyrase (NTPDase) enzymes (AtAPY1 and AtAPY2), which had been implicated in hydrolyzing and thus limiting the [eATP], actually altered the [eATP]. Our results, which we presented in posters at two international meetings, showed that the [eATP] is highest in root zones that have the highest growth rate (i.e., elongation zones) and that the constitutive expression of AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 lowered this concentration, whereas suppression of these apyrases raised the [eATP]. These results provided novel and important verification of previously postulated hypotheses about the relationship of eATP and apyrase enzymes to growth, and they are being assembled into a manuscript that we expect to submit this summer.",

            "task_description": "A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increase susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.\nIn short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in \"Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration\" including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA (NASA Research Announcement).",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.\nUnderstanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. For example, loss of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma is a commonality abound spaceflight/disuse, aging, Type 2 diabetes, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oxidative stress appears to be at the root of nNOSµ loss in theses muscle myopathies.  Out laboratory seeks to understand the underlying redox mechanisms that leader to perturbation in nNOS function and thus myopathy."

            "task_progress": "Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that adapts rapidly to changes in mechanical loading by altering its cross-sectional area and mass. The reduced mechanical loading of spaceflight causes postural muscles in the lower extremities and flexors in the upper extremities to lose fiber cross-sectional area and force-generating capacity. Muscle atrophy and weakness may then impede mission objectives, increase the risk of injury, and increase susceptibility to damage upon reloading. Muscular alterations with spaceflight are therefore a critical limitation to performance during spaceflight missions and a serious health concern for astronauts.\nExcessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is considered an important component of muscle myopathy with unloading. ROS are produced from the mitochondria and non-phagocytic NADPH-oxidases (NOX) in skeletal muscle fibers and thought to contribute to atrophy through activation of proteolytic pathways. In addition, ROS may initiate a signaling pathway that results in disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-complex (DGC). The DGC serves as an interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix and is responsible for the detection and transmittance of load necessary for regulation of various cellular processes. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others indicates that ROS-induced atrophy is related to disruption of the DGC and translocation of the mu(µ)-splice variant of nNOS from the sarcolemma into the cytosol. nNOSµ is then thought to directly stimulate FoxO3a and ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1, atrogin-1), leading to muscle fiber atrophy.\nThe purpose of this investigation is to identify oxidant-related mechanisms that lead to disruption of the DGC, translocation nNOSµ, proteolysis, and thus atrophy. Our central hypothesis is that ROS, produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria, cause translocation of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis and suppressing protein synthesis. Our experimental design consists of a series of studies utilizing a rodent hindlimb unloading model of spaceflight to: (1) identify NOX dependent signaling of nNOS translocation, FoxO3a activation, and muscle fiber atrophy, and (2) determine the redox regulatory role in DGC disruption with mechanical unloading and atrophy. In addition, additional investigation has been commenced to better translate these findings to spaceflight, where we have begun to use pharmaceutical (Losartan) and nutraceutical (fish oil + curcumin) interventions to limit unloading-induced atrophy.\nData that has been collected thus far indicates that: (1) administration of a potent antioxidant, the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134, prevents unloading induced atrophy during a short-term (54  hr) unloading protocol. Reduced atrophy was related to decreased expression of NOX subunits, ROS production, and markers of ROS-related signaling/damage. In addition, nNOS translocation was prevented with EUK-134 administration as well as related activation of proteolysis through FoxO3a dephosphorylation; (2) EUK-134 also prevented unloading induced atrophy during a longer 7-day unloading protocol, an effect also related to decreased ROS production and nNOS translocation as well as activation of anabolic pathways; (3) More specific targeting of ROS production by using a NOX-2 inhibitor, gp91 ds-tat, and mitochondrial ROS inhibitor, SS-31, has also resulted in reduced muscle fiber atrophy following a 7-day unloading protocol. Interestingly, an interaction between these two sources of ROS has also been suggested with our pilot data; and lastly, (4) pharmaceutical inhibition of angiotensin II receptor I (AT1R), and (5) a nutraceutical interventions with fish oil + curcumin, respectively, have demonstrated similar results.\nIn summary, inhibition of ROS appears to be effective in limiting skeletal muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading. Inhibition of ROS is related to augmented anabolic and reduced catabolic signaling as well as translocation of nNOS, and the source of ROS production may be from both the mitochondria and Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase. Future studies will focus on finalizing the 7-day EUK-134 interventional study including measurement of fractional synthesis rate; further delineating the mechanisms responsible for reduced atrophy with peptidyl inhibition of ROS using gp91ds-tat to target Nox2 and SS-31 to target mitochondria. We will also utilize a genetic ablation of Nox2 (gp91phox-/-) to further establish its role in unloading induced atrophy; and establishing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical interventions in preventing unloading-induced atrophy. In addition, fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and rate of protein degradation will be assessed in future experiments.",

Although this condition is largely attributed to the direct effects of unloading of the bone, coupling mechanisms associated with diminished bone and marrow perfusion, attenuated fluid flow within the bone, and fewer signaling molecules from vascular cells may also play a modulating role on the bone loss associated with spaceflight.\nIn the tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rat, an animal model of microgravity-induced osteopenia, hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow decrease with acute unloading (10 min) and continue to progressively decline through 28 days of unloading. The initial and chronic decrements in perfusion are primarily due to increases in osseous vascular resistance. In addition, when the HU rat hindlimb skeleton is reloaded during standing, long bone and marrow perfusion are lower and vascular resistance higher than that in standing control animals. These higher vascular resistances in HU rats could result from 1) increased vasoconstrictor responses of bone resistance arteries, or 2) decreased endothelium-dependent and/or endothelium-independent vasodilator responsiveness of bone resistance arteries.\nSpecific Aims:\nAim 1. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the responsiveness of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) to myogenic and vasoconstrictor stimuli.\nAim 2. To evaluate the contribution of endothelium-derived NO (nitric oxide) and vasodilator prostaglandins to acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin (BK), and flow-induced vasodilation in the femoral PNA from control and HU rats.\nAim 3. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the expression of endothelial NOS (eNOS), COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein, as well as M2-receptor (ACh) and B2-receptor (BK) mRNA, in the femoral PNA.\nAim 4. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the PNA responsiveness to endothelium-independent vasodilator stimuli.\nAim 5. To determine whether hindlimb unloading, radiation exposure, and the combined effects of these treatments alter endothelium-dependent vasodilation through NO or PGI2 signaling pathways, and to determine whether this is related to changes in bone volume and indices of cancellous bone micro-architecture.\nThe general hypothesis of this proposal is that skeletal unloading induces alterations in skeletal resistance artery function; these alterations serve to diminish bone perfusion and ultimately disrupt mechanisms for maintaining the normal balance between bone formation and bone resorption. The specific purpose is to elucidate vasoconstrictor and vasodilator mechanisms involved in the control of bone and marrow perfusion, including endothelial signaling pathways forming nitric oxide and prostacyclin, in bone during conditions of unloading, and to determine whether deficits in bone blood flow and endothelium-dependent vascular signaling are related to unloading-induced bone loss. To accomplish these goals, the principal nutrient artery of the femur from control and 14 day HU rats will be isolated and cannulated for in vitro experimentation. Mechanisms of smooth muscle and endothelial cell function in the osseous circulation will be determined, as well as how skeletal unloading alters these vasoconstrictor and vasodilator control mechanisms (Aims 1-4). Studies will then be conducted using adenoviral gene transfer (Aim 5) to manipulate bone and marrow perfusion and endothelium-dependent vasodilation to determine whether blood flow and vascular endothelial cell signaling is coupled to disuse-associated bone remodeling in the femur (i.e., bone formation rates, mass, total, cortical and cancellous bone mineral density, and mechanical strength). These studies will extend our knowledge and understanding of how skeletal unloading alters fluid and vascular coupling mechanisms, which have been suggested to modulate the balance of bone formation and degradation during microgravity. These studies may also provide new insight into the etiology of other degenerative bone disorders that occur concomitantly with cardiovascular dysfunction, such as heart disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and old age.",

Two additional manuscripts that will cite support from this grant are in preparation. In the first unpublished study, we examined whether simulated weightlessness and space-relevant irradiation of mice alters vascular responsiveness and bone properties 6-7 months after these treatment interventions, i.e., following a 6-7 period of normal weight bearing recovery. This period of recovery in mice is equivalent to approximately 20 human years. The data demonstrate that only high-LET (linear energy transfer) total body irradiation (TBI), but not hindlimb unloading (HU), has a sustained effect on endothelium-dependent vasodilation following the period of recovery, and that the combined effects of these two treatments (TBI-HU) to impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation is also sustained following the recovery period. The was a tendency for the trabecular bone volume fraction (trabecular bone volume/total bone volume) of the proximal tibia from TBI-HU mice to be lower than that in control mice, but this was not significant. Decrements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation are significantly correlated with changes in bone volume, indicating a coupling of vascular endothelial cell function is associated with bone loss induced by HU and TBI. This observation is similar to that which we reported earlier in mice where the effects of HU and TBI were determined immediately after the cessation of these treatments (Ghosh et al., Radiat. Res. 185: 257-266, 2016), although the relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and bone volume fraction was not as robust following the recovery period. Collectively, these data demonstrate the important relation between bone blood flow, bone vascular function, and trabecular bone volume.\nFor the second manuscript in preparation, we examined the effects of a commonly used countermeasure for spaceflight-induced bone loss (i.e., exercise) to determine its effect on bone blood flow. Like that shown to occur in hindlimb bones with chronic unloading (Stabley et al., 2013), old age also diminishes perfusion of bone marrow and regions of bone containing high volumes of trabecular bone. Results from this study demonstrate that 10-12 weeks of low-intensity exercise training (ET) restores bone perfusion in old (25-26 months old) rats to levels occurring in young adult (6 months old) animals. Thus, these data support the notion that regular physical activity maintains and improves bone perfusion and bone health.\nStabley JN, Prisby RD, Behnke BJ, Delp MD. \"Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.\" Bone. 2013 Dec;57(2):355-60.",

This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.\nThese experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.\nA significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.",

            "task_progress": "Summary of Major Results\n***Project 1: Phototropic curvature***\nUtilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) on board the International Space Station (ISS), we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B.  Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1 g.  A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1 g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination.  Additionally, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be a product of directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravity.\n***Project 2: Gene Profiling***\nThe transcriptome of seedlings were analyzed from experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) to study the interacting effects of light and gravity on plant tropisms.  Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated and grown in cassettes in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for 4 days at 1g then exposed to a range of gravitational accelerations (microgravity, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53g, and 1g) and light treatments (blue light with or without a 1 hour pretreatment with red light).  At the end of the space experiments, the cassettes containing the seedlings were frozen in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) and returned to Earth on space shuttle STS-131.  The RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and used for the transcriptome analyses. A comparison of 1g-treated-spaceflight samples with ground controls identified 230 genes that were differentially regulated at least two-fold (p < 0.01). A further comparison of all spaceflight samples with ground controls identified approximately 280 genes that were differentially regulated at least two fold (p < 0.01).  Of these genes, several were involved in regulating cell polarity (i.e., auxin, calcium, lipid metabolism), cell wall development, oxygen status, and cell defense or stress. However, when the transcriptome of the all g-treated spaceflight samples were compared with microgravity samples, only approx.130 genes were identified as being differently regulated (p < 0.01). Of these, only 27 were at least 2 fold differently regulated between microgravity and 1g samples and included putatitive/pseudo/undefined genes (n=14), transposable elements (n=5), an expansin (ATEXP24; At1g21240), a cell-wall kinase (WAK3; At1g21240), a laccase-like flavonoid oxidase (TT10;At5g48100), among others.   Not surprisingly, there was a difference in the % of genes represented in individual gene categories when comparing spaceflight samples with ground controls and spaceflight microgravity versus spaceflight g-treated space samples.   These results emphasize the need for tissue fixation on the centrifuge for an accurate spaceflight control.  These results are one of the few reports of transcriptome analyses from a space experiment with plants that had gravity treatments using an on-board centrifuge.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by  \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

            "task_description": "This research has capitalized on the capabilities of the VEGGIE hardware to address how spaceflight affects plant gene expression and growth related to low oxygen stress (hypoxia). Hypoxia is thought to develop in spaceflight as weightlessness nullifies the buoyancy-driven convection that usually aids in mixing and supplying gas (oxygen) around organisms. Our analysis of Arabidopsis grown on the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the BRIC17 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiment is consistent with the plants grown in space having experienced long-term hypoxic stress. These plants also showed hallmarks of up-regulating Ca2+- and reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) pathways (such as those supported by the enzyme RBOHD). Further, we have identified a Ca2+ transporter named CAX2 as playing a critical role in this hypoxic signaling system. We therefore have used the plant growth capabilities of the VEGGIE to significantly extend our insights into hypoxic stress. Wild-type, rbohD, and cax2 mutant seedlings were grown on orbit. After 8 days, samples were photographed, fixed in RNAlater using Kennedy Fixation Tubes, and frozen for subsequent post-flight analysis. For analysis, we have quantified patterns of growth and gene expression using the techniques of RNAseq and qPCR. In addition, analysis of a ROS reporter gene tagged with green fluorescent protein has been made using fluorescence microscopy. Comparison to plants grown on the ground help define how much of the responses seen on orbit can be explained by the development of long-term hypoxia linked to the microgravity environment. Results from this analysis are expected to advance our understanding of hypoxic response in plants grown in both space and on Earth in addition to testing whether the hypoxic Ca2+ signaling system provides targets for genetically engineering potential countermeasures to low oxygen stress.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research has addressed how spaceflight may induce stresses related to reduced oxygen availability in plants. The work has targeted the role of Ca2+ signaling and reactive oxygen species as components of this response to define molecular components of the system. The results from this work will both provide insight into a potentially important element of spaceflight-related stress and also help to define elements of the low oxygen response system that operates on Earth. Plants on Earth experience such conditions during flooding of the soil, when there is a large microbial population in the soil consuming available oxygen and even when the metabolic activities within the plant's own tissues are intense enough to consume available oxygen. These natural low oxygen events are sensed by plants and can lead to either changes in growth and development to accommodate or escape them, or in extreme cases they can lead to significant losses in productivity and even death. These spaceflight experiments on low oxygen sensing mechanisms will therefore help provide molecular targets for potential manipulation to help make plants more tolerant of low oxygen and so contribute to agronomically important traits such as flooding tolerance in crop plants."

            "task_progress": "APEX-05 mission and sample analyses: APEX05 successfully launched on SpaceX-13. Plants were grown on orbit in the Veggie hardware, were returned frozen, and gene expression analysis using RNAseq also successfully completed. The experimental plants grew for 8 days on orbit and showed the expected levels of vigorous development, comparable to the parallel ground controls. All flight success criteria and subsequent sample analyses were in the excellent range.\nThe overarching hypothesis for the APEX05 experimental design is that spaceflight imposes hypoxic and oxidative stress that will be disrupted in the cax2 and atrbohd mutants and that this will be reflected in the patterns of gene expression from plants growing on orbit. This idea is supported by direct analysis of various Arabidopsis ecotypes grown on the ISS and by comparison of the transcriptional responses from multiple plant spaceflight experiments analyzed using the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database, which aggregates much of the available data in this area. Comparison of gene expression patterns in flight vs ground samples for APEX-05 indicate these ideas are likely correct. The wild type control plants showed patterns of gene expression consistent with both hypoxia and oxidative stress as well as reduction in both root and shoot growth when compared to ground controls.\nAPEX-05 cax2 responses: The hypoxia resistant cax2 mutants showed reduced induction of hypoxia-related transcripts in spaceflight. Consistent with these observations, the cax2 mutants also showed high basal expression of several molecular markers of hypoxic response, suggesting they were constitutively adapted to hypoxia, even when O2 levels were normal. Further, in ground-based controls on Earth showed these mutants were resistant to hypoxia and to flooding stress (another low oxygen environment), again consistent with a constant hypoxia response pre-adapting them to this stress. CAX2 is a Ca2+ pump that should attenuate the Ca2+ signaling triggered by low oxygen levels and the cax2 mutants showed elevated basal Ca2+ levels and significantly higher hypoxia-induced Ca2+ signals, providing a potential mechanism for their constitutive and enhanced low O2 stress resilience.\nAPEX-05 rbohd responses: The wild-type plants in space also showed evidence of the induction of genes responsive to oxidative stress, such as a suite of molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein family. These genes were not induced in the rbohD mutant, which maintained growth in spaceflight above levels of the wild type control plants. In ground controls, the rbohd mutants also showed resistance to hypoxic and flooding stresses, suggesting hypoxia and ROS signaling may be intimately interrelated in spaceflight responses.\nGround-based analyses: As part of these studies a series of ground-based analyses have been conducted to help either develop assays for the spaceflight experiments, or to better define the Ca2+ and ROS-based signaling in plants likely triggered by spaceflight. An improved red-light based system to impose dormancy on Arabidopsis seeds to aid in their transfer to orbit for APEX-05 has been developed and a collaboration with the Townsend group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has led to production of a hyperspectral imaging system to investigate how this technology might be applied to monitoring plant stress in growth chamber environments such as the Veggie hardware used for APEX-05. During analyses of signaling events, a new plant-wide ROS and Ca2+ signaling system based on propagating waves of Ca2+ has been revealed. Additionally, a new transcriptional reporter for monitoring the dynamics of ROS-imposed stress throughout the plant has been developed.\nPresentations and Outreach/Education: The APEX-05 project has been presented at numerous national and international meetings including regularly at the Plant Cell Dynamics Meeting, the ISS Research and Development Conference, the annual meetings of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, and the American Society of Plant Biology, and at university venues ranging from South Dakota State to the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. APEX-05 has also been central to a series of outreach activities, being regularly presented at events ranging from University of Wisconsin sponsored outreach days (e.g., University of Wisconsin’s Science Expeditions) to presentations for high school students, undergraduates, and middle school and K-12 teachers (such as regularly at the BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute summer training program for teachers). APEX-05 has also been featured in some unique mentoring opportunities such as to multiple groups participating in the plant space biology themed First Lego League Championship over 2018-2019. Multiple cohorts of undergraduates have also participated in designing and fabricating hardware such as the red-light dormancy inducing system used in the APEX-05 flight or clinostats and low O2 chambers used in the ground-based controls for the APEX-05 experimentation.",

            "task_description": "Spaceflight, by impairing the differentiation program of stem cells residing within bone marrow results in bone loss, increased bone marrow adiposity, anemia, and impaired immune function.  Because these disturbances may potentially compromise the success of long-duration flights, there exists an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and implement effective countermeasures.  We propose to test the novel hypothesis that negative energy balance during spaceflight results in 1) bone marrow dysfunction and increased marrow adiposity and 2) altered signaling by  peripheral adipokines (cytokines produced by adipocytes) all of which, in turn, contribute to negative bone turnover balance and bone loss.  The proposed research will focus on the precise role of adipose tissue and the important adipokine leptin in mediating the detrimental effects of simulated spaceflight (hindlimb unloading (HU)) on bone marrow cells in mice by accomplishing the following 2 specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that increased bone marrow adiposity plays a causal role in mediating simulated spaceflight-induced changes in bone metabolism.  This will be accomplished by comparing the skeletal response to hindlimb unloading of wild type (WT) mice with mice incapable of generating bone marrow adipocytes (kit-receptor-deficient KitW/W-v mice).  Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, by targeting the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells, plays a key role in mediating energy sensitive changes in bone metabolism during simulated spaceflight.  This will be accomplished by examining whether transplantation of mesenchymal or hematopoietic stem cells from leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice into WT mice alters bone loss during simulated spaceflight. Completion of the proposed project is expected to increase our understanding of the role of energy metabolism in mediating bone loss during simulated spaceflight and suggest specific non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of spaceflight on bone marrow.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Osteoporosis is a major health concern.  To our knowledge, all forms of osteoporosis involve infiltration of fat into bone marrow.  If the increased marrow fat alters the magnitude of bone loss, as hypothesized, this research will have significance to human health that transcends protecting astronauts from bone loss during spaceflight.\nSuccessful completion of the proposed research involved substantial model development and validation and this work will have impact far beyond the specific aims of this project.  To accomplish Specific Aim 1, it was necessary to perform adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow cells into kitw/w-v mice (Specific Aim 1).  While bone marrow transplantation is routinely performed in the field of immunology, the impact of whole body sub-lethal and lethal radiation typically used to perform the procedure on the skeleton has received little attention.  In the course of validating our model we performed several pilot studies that led to the unexpected finding that high dose radiation with photons, while having devastating effects on the hematopoietic compartment actually induces bone lining cells to become osteoblasts, leading to a transient increase in bone formation.  Based on the likelihood that this activation of bone lining cells represents a potential therapeutic target we hope to pursue the mechanism for this response.  Additionally, we made major advances in optimizing adoptive transfer for bone research: we have developed a protocol where following lethal irradiation we have quantitatively replaced hematopoietic cells in bone marrow with donor cells with no bone loss.  This was accomplished with as few as 750 purified hematopoietic stem cells (publication in review and publication in preparation).\nMice exhibit premature age-related cancellous bone loss. Specifically, as much as 2/3 of the cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis is resorbed prior to establishment of peak total bone mass.  The negative implication of this bone loss for HU studies is obvious. The mechanism, however, was unknown. In the course of performing studies in which mice were housed at thermoneutral (32°C) to minimize adaptive thermogenesis, we noted that the mice housed at this warm temperature showed unusually high cancellous bone volume fraction.  Further investigation confirmed that premature cancellous bone loss in mice housed at room temperature is caused by mild cold stress (Iwaniec et al., 2016). While the low cancellous bone mass at clinically relevant sites in skeletally mature mice is an issue for preclinical studies, an even more important issue is whether physiological adaptation to mild cold stress influences the outcome of preclinical studies. This is of particular concern to spaceflight studies where mice housed at subthermoneutral temperatures during microgravity are likely to be more dependent upon adaptive thermogenesis than weight bearing controls, leading to bone loss independent of reduced weight bearing.\nReference: Iwaniec UT, Philbrick KA, Wong CP, Gordon JL, Kahler-Quesada AM, Olson DA,   Branscum AJ, Sargent JL, DeMambro VE, Rosen CJ, Turner RT.

            "task_progress": "Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that increased bone marrow adiposity plays a causal role in mediating simulated spaceflight-induced changes in bone metabolism.\nWe evaluated the impact of a 14d spaceflight (in slowly growing ovariectomized rats) and a 14d simulated spaceflight (hindlimb unloading (HU) in adult male mice) on bone marrow adiposity.  As described in detail in Keune et al., 2016, bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increased in the distal femur metaphysis during spaceflight.  During the same interval there was a reduction in cancellous bone volume fraction.  The observed bone loss was due to increased bone resorption; osteoblast number, osteoblast activity and osteoblast turnover were normal.  In agreement, HU resulted in bone loss in male mice and the bone loss was due to increased bone resorption.  However, we were surprised to find that HU did not result in an increase in MAT (publication under review) in WBB6F1/J mice.  It should be noted that this unexpected finding was replicated in HU C57BL6 mice (publication in preparation). We conclude from these results that increased MAT is not a prerequisite for bone loss in HU mice.\nWe originally hypothesized that mice incapable of producing MAT would be protected from HU-induced cancellous bone loss whereas mice with excessive MAT would exhibit increased bone loss.  We tested these hypotheses using kitw/w-v (MAT-deficient) mice and ob/ob (excessive MAT) mice.  As expected, decreased MAT was associated with increased bone formation and increased MAT was associated with decreased bone formation.  However, HU-induced cancellous bone loss was exaggerated in MAT- mice and not impacted by excessive MAT (publication in preparation).\nTaken together, our studies demonstrate that spaceflight-induced cancellous bone loss in ovariectomized rats and HU-induced cancellous bone loss in male mice each occur as a result of increased bone turnover, where the increase in resorption is inadequately compensated for by bone formation.  While lineage decision (mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts or adipocytes) was shown to influence bone formation and MAT levels, our findings do not support a causal relationship between MAT infiltration and bone loss during spaceflight.  Indeed, our studies in MAT-deficient mice suggest that MAT may have a protective role in limiting bone loss.  Further research will be required to verify these findings and determine the underlying mechanisms.\nSpecific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, by targeting the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells, plays a key role in mediating energy sensitive changes in bone metabolism during simulated spaceflight.\nWe performed a series of studies to test this hypothesis. Initial studies were focused on establishing the effects of leptin on MAT and bone turnover in normal rats and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (Turner et al., 2014; Turner et al., 2015; Philbrick KA et al., 2015; Lindenmaier et al., 2016). We also addressed the controversy as to whether the physiological actions of leptin on bone are mediated through peripheral or central nervous system (CNS)-mediated signaling (publication under review).  This question is important because leptin regulates energy metabolism through CNS signaling.  Subsequent studies focused on how leptin impacts bone and energy metabolism during HU (publication in preparation).\nTaken together, our studies provide strong evidence that leptin administered subcutaneously and hypothalamic leptin gene therapy have surprisingly similar effects on bone metabolism in ob/ob mice; specifically, leptin decreased MAT, increased osteoblast number and activity, and increased osteoclast activity.  Dose response studies revealed that the skeletal effects of leptin occur at very low circulating levels of the hormone (levels having minimal effects on food intake or body weight), suggesting that previously published reports demonstrating skeletal effects of leptin delivered into the hypothalamus were due to transport of leptin into peripheral circulation and not due to CNS mediated actions.  If confirmed, our finding that the actions of peripheral leptin on bone and central actions of leptin on energy metabolism are dissociable from one another would represent a paradigm shift.\nIt is well established that there is a close association between the magnitude of mechanical loading of the skeleton and bone mass, and that bone loss often accompanies weight loss induced by dieting (Iwaniec and Turner, 2016).  Potentially, this is due to combined decreases in peripheral and CNS leptin levels.  In support, we have shown that increasing hypothalamic levels in adult rats can reduce body weight but, in contrast to caloric restriction, promote weight loss without bone loss (Turner et al., 2015). It is well established that weight loss due to reduced food intake contributes to bone loss during HU and for this reason, weight bearing controls are normally pair-fed to HU rodents.  However, as shown for weight bearing rodents (Turner et al., 2015), leptin treatment of HU ob/ob mice, although inducing weight loss, did not result in further bone loss (publication in preparation).\nReferences\nKeune, JA, Philbrick KA, Branscum AJ, Iwaniec UT, Turner RT.

            "task_description": "One of the main concerns for long-term deep manned space missions are health risks associated with altered gravitational environment and prolonged exposure to low-dose radiation above levels normally found on Earth. Microgravity and radiation exposure have been known to produce a number of neurological disturbances and neurodegeneration by space flight condition. However, the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the brain vasculature and the underlying mechanism(s) of these disturbances are less studied and remain unclear.\nOur proposal seeks to fill in the gap by testing the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase is a critical source of the neurovascular oxidative stress following space flight conditions that mediates vascular remodeling in the brain, thus disrupting communication between endothelial cells and astrocytes and altering production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It is further proposed that these changes will contribute to increased vascular permeability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disturbance, thus resulting in neurological deficit.\nOur specific aims are 1) Define the causal relationships between space flight condition induced NADPH oxidase expression, vascular damage, and BBB function following microgravity and/or low-dose irradiation in mature mice using neuropathology, stereological, and automated image analysis, and neurobehavioral outcomes. 2) Determine if space flight condition-induced oxidative stress is mediated through NADPH oxidase in brain microvasculature.\nNox2 (a subunit of NADPH oxidase) gene knockout (Nox2(-/-)) mice, and  wild-type (Nox2(+/+))  C57BL/6 mice  will be used in this ground-based animal study. Hindlimb unloading (HLU) will be used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component.  Low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma-irradiation (0.5 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) will be delivered to the whole-body of mature adult mice to simulate the radiation component for over 21 days while the animals are tail-unloaded in cages for microgravity simulation.  We will evaluate the radiation- and microgravity-induced brain vascular and tissue remodeling at multiple time points (1 day to 12 months post-irradiation).\nTogether, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced imaging techniques, stereological analysis, and behavioral tests will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of space flight condition-induced oxidative damage on brain tissue and vascular remodeling. Understanding how factors and environmental stress impact on vasculature, tissue remodeling, and function will increase our knowledge and focus toward more effective countermeasures during human space flight and planetary exploration. Our study will also lend new insights into the causes and possible treatments of debilitating neurovascular-related disease and neurodegeneration by targeting NADPH oxidase activation.",

There are strong indications that the physiological effects of space flight are similar to those seen in some neurodegenerative diseases and aging: multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease. Our study will provide the first detailed description of combined effects of microgravity and LDR radiation on oxidative stress-induced brain tissue and microvessel network remodeling and underlying mechanism(s) of potential interaction of space flight environmental components over a 12-month observation period. Our research will provide important input to elucidate cellular pathways of response and adaptation to stress imposed by environmental conditions in the brain vasculature. Understanding how factors and environmental insults impact on vasculature and tissue remodeling and function will increase our knowledge and help focus the approach toward more effective countermeasures during human space flight and planetary exploration.

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORTING SEPTEMBER 2019\nAll the experiments and data analysis have been completed as planned.  So far, we have finished four batches of wild-type (WT) animal studies for specific aim 1, at 7 days, 1, 3, and 9 month time points and Nox2 knockout mice study as proposed in specific aims 1 and 2.  We have examined protein markers associated with the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis in the brain using immunostaining, metabolic response using metabolic biochemical assays, hematological parameters, and behavioral responses after combined exposure to simulated microgravity and low-dose radiation. Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers which may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These results have been published in four peer reviewed journals: Radiation Research, Nature npj Microgravity, PLOS One.\nWe have received supplement funding in October, 2017 to use\"omics\"-based molecular phenotyping approach for identification and characterization of genomic signatures in eye and brain associated with low-dose radiation and simulated microgravity at 1-and 4- month time points. Omics analyses were performed for full genome transcriptomics including RNA-Seq HT Ribo-depletion library preps and RNA spike-control. DNA methylation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS).  The dataset has been submitted to NASA GeneLab site, through NASA IT system. One manuscript titled:  Mice Exposed to Combined Chronic Low-Dose Irradiation and Modeled Microgravity Develop Long-Term Neurological Sequelae has been published in International Journal of Medical Sciences (IJMS) to evaluate simulated radiation and microgravity induced changes in the brain related to cellular structure, oxidative stress, immune response, and metabolic function.\nANNUAL REPORTING SEPTEMBER 2018: The purpose of this study was to determine whether nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-derived stress can account for unloading- and radiation-induced endothelial damage and neurovascular remodeling in a mouse model. Wild-type (WT, Nox2 (+/+)) C57BL/6 mice or Nox2 (-/-) (B6. 129S6-CYBBM) knockout (KO) mice were placed into one of the following groups: age-matched control, hindlimb unloading (HLU), low-dose/low-dose-rate radiation (LDR), or HLU+LDR simultaneously for 21 days, and were then sacrificed 1 month later. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of microgravity. The LDR was delivered using 57Co plates (0.04Gy at 0.01cGy/h) to the whole body in order to simulate the radiation experienced while in space.  Brains were isolated for characterization of various oxidative stress markers and vascular topology.\nWe received supplement funding in October, 2017 to use  “omics”-based molecular phenotyping approach for identification and characterization of genomic signatures in eye and brain associated with low-dose radiation and simulated microgravity  at 1- and 4– month time points. Omics analyses performed were\n•\t RNAseq for full genome transcriptomics including RNA-Seq HT Ribo-depletion library preps and RNA spike-control.\n•\tDNA methylation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS).\nThe assay has completed and dataset are in the process of submitting to NASA GeneLab site, through NASA IT system. Many canonical pathways were significantly activated/inhibited in the brain after HLU, LDgammaR, or the combination of both. Most robust changes are observed in LDgammaR + HLU group compared to control. At 1 months, the combination group induced significant activations of EIF2 phosphorylation signaling pathway in the brain, responsible for chronic neurodegeneration. Cellular immune response pathways including leukocyte extravasation signaling, as well as pathways responsible for cell growth, cell repair, and metabolic stress were also significantly altered compared to controls.  The mRNA expression for many genes regulating oxidative stress (e.g., GNRH1, UCN3), extracellular matrix remodeling (e.g., Cldn3, FBLN1), endothelial cell biology (e.g., AQP1), and cognitive function (e.g., OXT, AVP) were significantly changed (p<0.05) after HLU+ LDgammaR compared to control.  Gene analysis  of retina tissues also showed that many key pathways responsible for photoreceptor function, oxidative stress, and metabolic function were significantly different between LDgammaR + HLU and control (p<0.05).",

            "task_description": "Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the \"spaceflight syndrome\") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.\nCentral Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.\nSpecific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:\nA. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.\nB. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or \"RNA-Seq\") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance.\nThis report documents the activities related to “Global transcriptome profiling to identify cellular stress mechanisms responsible for spaceflight-induced antibiotic resistance”. The original grant was to perform the spaceflight experiment “Biological Research in Canisters #21 (BRIC-21), with the aim of understanding how bacterial cells perceive and respond to the human spaceflight environment. We have successfully completed all the original aims and goals of this grant proposal.\nNew Objective:  \tIn 2019, this grant was tasked with a new objective: to develop and test in spaceflight a new sample compartment for use in BRIC-PDFU and/or BRIC-LED hardware. In all previous BRIC experiments, the sample compartment consisted of the bottom half of a standard 60-mm Petri dish. However, during the BRIC-21 experiment we noted that liquid cultures assumed a toroidal shape in spaceflight (FL), in contrast to the disk-shaped ground control (GC) samples. It was hypothesized that this difference in culture geometry might account in part for the measured differences in the transcriptomic responses between FL and GC samples (Morrison, M.D., P. Fajardo-Cavazos, and W.L. Nicholson. 2019. Comparison of Bacillus subtilis transcriptome profiles from two separate missions to the International Space Station. npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0).  \tIn collaboration with the laboratories of Drs. Mark Weislogel and Titel Jurca, we have conceived and built a new sample compartment designed to mitigate the effects of microgravity on liquid culture geometry in petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Drop-tower and biocompatibility testing of a prototype device was in progress when our labs were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which essentially halted all progress on the project for several months. During the past year (10/01/2020 to 09/30/2021), we have resumed laboratory operations and have completed testing of the new modified Petri dish insert. It is now ready for utilization in spaceflight.",

            "task_progress": "The major factor influencing the behavior of microbes growing in liquids in space is microgravity. We recently measured the transcriptomic response of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis to the microgravity environment inside the ISS in spaceflight hardware called Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs). In two separate experiments in the ISS, dubbed BRIC-21 and BRIC-23, we grew multiple replicates of the same B. subtilis strain in the same hardware, growth medium, and temperature with matching ground control samples (npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0). [Ed. Note: See Cumulative Bibliography listing.] In both experiments, we observed similar responses of the transcriptome to spaceflight. However, we also noted that the liquid cultures assumed a different configuration in microgravity (a toroidal shape) compared with the ground control samples (a flat disk shape), leading us to question whether the transcriptome differences we observed were a direct result of microgravity, or a secondary result of the different liquid geometries of the samples affecting, for example, oxygen availability.\nTo mitigate the influence of microgravity on liquid geometry in BRIC canisters, we have designed an insert to replace the standard 60-mm Petri dish in BRIC-PDFU or BRIC-LED sample compartments. In this design, liquid cultures are expected to assume a more disk-like configuration regardless of gravity or its absence. We have: (i) constructed a prototype device by 3D printing; (ii) evaluated different starting materials, treatments, and coatings for their wettability (i.e., hydrophilicity) using contact angle measurements; (iii) confirmed that the device performs as designed by drop-tower testing and; (iv) performed material biocompatibility studies using liquid cultures of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Future microgravity testing of the device in the ISS is planned.",

            "task_description": "The amount of bone loss between individual astronauts is highly variable with some astronauts losing large amounts of bone while others are largely unaffected. This variability is accounted for, at least to a large extent, by genetic variations between individuals. Unfortunately, the specific genes that modulate this genetic sensitivity of bone loss in microgravity are unknown.  To this end, we have recently completed a genetic study in which we identified specific regions on chromosomes (QTL or Quantitative Trait Loci) that either add to or reduce the propensity of an individual to lose bone when normal weightbearing is removed from the musculoskeleton. While providing critical information, these QTL still contain hundreds of genes, rather than a single one. Here, we propose first to greatly reduce the number of candidate genes with bioinformatics tools and then experimentally test the shortlist of candidate genes using knockout mice available from the Jackson Laboratory’s (JAX) Genetic Resource Repository and the JAX Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP) production center. The identification of single genes modulating bone loss during weightlessness can be used as a critical diagnostic tool for the identification of astronauts most in need of countermeasures as well as to unravel novel drug targets that preserve bone health in space.",

            "task_description": "For most organisms the stresses associated with spaceflight induce a variety of detrimental effects. To foster a safe and productive long-term human presence in space, therapies and countermeasures to spaceflight-induced stress should be developed. Tardigrades (water bears) are polyextremophiles that have evolved to tolerate multiple extreme environments, which are restrictive to most life. In 2007 tardigrades were shown to survive and reproduce normally during an 11-day low Earth orbit on the Foton-M3 Capsule. We speculate that mechanisms tardigrades have evolved to withstand extreme environments on Earth may, as a side-effect, confer protection against the stresses of spaceflight. This makes tardigrades a uniquely valuable system for studying responses to spaceflight. We have sequenced the genome of the tardigrades Hypsibius dujardini, as well as developed and validated experimental and computational approaches for measuring the effect of different environmental conditions on tardigrade gene expression – allowing us to identify mechanisms used by tardigrades to protect themselves from different stresses. We have also developed a reverse genetic approach, RNA interference, for tardigrades that allows us to directly investigate the role of a gene in conferring tolerance to an environment. We will use these approaches to study tardigrades’ initial, as well as multigenerational, response to spaceflight and use RNA interference to test the functionality of the genes identified in our study. Next-generation transcriptome sequencing will be conducted on tardigrades cultures kept 0 generations (founding generation) and 4 generations onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Differential expression analysis will be conducted to compare ISS spaceflight timepoints, ground controls, and tardigrades exposed to other extreme stresses (e.g., desiccation, freezing). This approach will allow us to identify potential mediators of stress tolerance, which will serve as candidates for functional RNA interference experiments. Understanding how tardigrades tolerate spaceflight will better guide future research into countermeasures and therapies for humans exposed to the stresses of prolonged space travel. This proposal's strengths are: the use of an organism that is suited to studying mechanisms of multigenerational tolerance of extreme environments and that has an established RNA interference method for confirming the function of genes identified in our study, our Preliminary Results that validate our proposed approach and technical capabilities as well as the uniqueness and suitability of tardigrades that will allow us to conduct this study. The participants for this study are comprised of experts in tardigrades' stress response and have considerable experience with next-generation sequencing and analysis of non-model organisms. The proposed experiments directly address recommendation AH16 of the Decadal Survey and are in line with recommendation OCB-5 and CMM-5 of NASA’s Multigenerational and Developmental Biology of Invertebrates Research Emphasis as well as NASA’s Fundamental Space Biology Plan 2010-2020 goals. Completion of our proposal will identify genes required for tardigrades to survive multigenerational spaceflight and will be a key step towards developing countermeasures and therapies for stresses associated with prolonged human exposure to space environments.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Along with using mechanisms of stress tolerance to counteract detrimental effects of space travel, data from our proposed experiments could be used in the long term toward solving serious problems in the field of human health. Utilizing mechanisms that allow tardigrades to stabilize their cellular proteins and nucleic acids has been proposed as an option for the dry storage and stabilization of vaccines and other biomaterials (Guo et al., 2000; Wolkers et al., 2001; Puhlev et al., 2001). Because current techniques for vaccine production, distribution, and storage nearly always require a constant cold chain (e.g., -80 and 20 degrees C freezers), these processes are extremely expensive. Some estimates put cold chain costs at around 80% of the total cost of vaccination (Chen et al., 2011). By generating additional stress response datasets, such as response to microgravity, freezing, irradiation, and hypoxia, we will increase our ability and that of other researchers to identify specific mediators of desiccation tolerance, which will then be applied to this and similar problems.\nAdditionally, a better understanding of mechanisms of stress tolerance could lead to the development of drought and/or freeze tolerant crops.\nGuo, N., Puhlev, I., Brown, D.

            "task_progress": "REPORTING  FROM AUGUST 2019; PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR MOVED TO UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING IN FALL 2019 and NEW GRANT 80NSSC20K0283 AWARDED (Ed., 7/24/2020)\nThe bulk of our research on NASA Grant NNX15AB44G that was conducted at UNC (the University of North Carolina) can be broken down into two categories: 1.) ground controls and experiments, and 2.) testing and validation for our flight experiment. Below are summaries of our research in both of these categories.  Ground Controls and Experiments\nIdentification and functional assays to identify mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance: To prepare for comparison of changes in gene expression manifested by tardigrades (water bears) exposed to multigenerational spaceflight with ground-based stresses we have begun gathering transcriptomic datasets from terrestrial stresses. In addition we have performed functional experiments to assess which candidate genes from our transcriptomic datasets are functional mediators of desiccation (drying) tolerance.\nOur major findings from these endeavors have been published in Boothby et al., 2017 (Boothby TC, Pielak GJ. Intrinsically disordered proteins and desiccation tolerance: Elucidating functional and mechanistic underpinnings of anhydrobiosis. Bioessays. 2017 Nov;39(11):700119. Epub 2017 Sep 13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201700119\n; PubMed\nPMID: 28901557\n; Ed. Note 9/9/19: reported in August 2018 FY2018 Task Book report Bibliography ). These results will be summarized here briefly since detailed descriptions of the experiments, methods, and results are presented in publication.\nTo identify genes that might play a role in tardigrade desiccation tolerance, we extracted and sequenced RNA from tardigrades that had either been left unstressed in culture or desiccated. Comparison of transcript levels coming from each predicted gene was conducted and genes ranked based on fold change (how much expression of the gene increased during drying) and overall abundance (how many transcripts per million transcripts were coming from a particular gene).\nThe main takeaway from this comparison was that a class of tardigrade specific genes known as Cytosolic Abundant Heat Soluble (CAHS) genes are upregulated heavily during desiccation. We performed RNA interference experiments in tardigrades to reduce the level of expression of these genes and found that the animals no longer robustly survived drying when CAHS genes were targeted. We also found that expressing these genes in bacteria and yeast (which normally do not have these genes) led to up to two orders of magnitude increases (100X) in desiccation tolerance. Amazingly, when purified CAHS proteins were found to protect biological material (the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase) about an order of magnitude (10X) better than current FDA approved excipient trehalose and serum albumin.\nFinally, we correlate the protective capabilities of these CAHS proteins to their ability to form vitrified (glass-like) solids, as opposed to crystalline solids. These finding may be of interest to NASA, as this presents an avenue for stabilizing and protecting biological material in a dry state without refrigeration. This might be useful for prolonged storage of biomaterials on the ISS or other spaceflight missions where freezer and refrigeration space is limited or logistically difficult.\nExploring cross-tolerance between desiccation and freeze tolerances in tardigrades:\nTardigrades survive an amazing number of abiotic stresses, and in some cases the severity of these stresses is well beyond that tardigrades would ever experience in nature (e.g., temperatures close to absolute zero, thousands of gray of radiation, the vacuum of outer space). The question therefore arises--how did tardigrades evolve tolerance to stresses they have never experienced? One hypothesis is that as tardigrades moved onto land from the ocean (where they originally evolved) they developed desiccation tolerance in response to their new, dryer, conditions and as a by-product became tolerant to other stresses. If this hypothesis is correct, then the mediators that tardigrades use to survive desiccation should in theory be the same mediators they use to survive other stresses. To assess if this is true we performed transcriptome sequencing on tardigrades that had been frozen, and compared this data to our previous datasets (desiccated and unstressed).\nSurprisingly, we found that changes in gene expression between desiccated and frozen tardigrades are highly divergent. In fact, either stress condition is more similar to unstressed conditions than they are to each other. Most telling, we observed that expression of CAHS genes was not influenced by freezing conditions, and furthermore RNA interference targeting these genes did not result in statistical decreases in survival in tardigrades exposed to freezing conditions.\nThese results are presented in detail in Boothby et al., 2017 (Boothby TC, Pielak GJ. Intrinsically disordered proteins and desiccation tolerance: Elucidating functional and mechanistic underpinnings of anhydrobiosis. Bioessays. 2017 Nov;39(11):700119. Epub 2017 Sep 13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201700119\n; PubMed\nPMID: 28901557\n; Ed. Note 9/9/19: reported in August 2018 FY2018 Task Book report Bibliography ).\nWe are now delving more into our frozen transcriptome to identify functional mediators of freeze tolerance in tardigrades using a similar approach to the one taken for our desiccation study.\nUnderstanding to commonalities and differences between how tardigrades survive freezing and desiccation is an important facet of our overall strategy for this project, as spaceflight induced changes in gene response will ultimately be compared to ground-based stress responses. Comparing changes in gene expression for ground-based stresses now will help us understand the overlap with spaceflight induced changes later.\nHow do tardigrade CAHS proteins mediate desiccation tolerance?\nTo better understand of CAHS proteins protect tardigrades and other biological material and cells from the harmful effects of drying, and how these proteins might protect biological materials from other stresses (included spaceflight), we have been characterizing the biochemical and biophysical nature of these proteins.\nWe have discovered that these proteins behave in a very peculiar way. At room temperature and at concentrations greater than or equal to 30 g/L these proteins form reversible hydrogels. We have characterized the gel state of these proteins via cone plate rheometry as well as scanning electron microscopy. Both techniques clearly demonstrate that these proteins have classic gel-like behavior and morphology. In retrospect it makes sense that these proteins form hydrogels, as hydrogels are known to form vitrified solids when dried (see above).\nWe were curious if the gel state of these proteins is important for their protective capabilities. To probe this, we used 19-F NMR to look at the folded state of a test protein, SH3. SH3 is a ‘metastable’ protein, meaning that normally (in solution) SH3 is in a folded state ~50% of the time and in an unfolded state about ~50% of the time. This is easily measured using 19-F NMR. We first tested SH3 in solution, and as expected two clear peaks (folded and unfolded) were present. We then co-incubated SH3 with a CAHS protein (at increasing concentrations) and looked at the levels of folded and unfolded protein. We found that CAHS proteins had no noticeable effect on SH3 folding below 30 g/L. However, above 30 g/L of CAHS protein, there was a reduction in the level of unfolded SH3 protein, and a corresponding increase in folded SH3. Interestingly, 30 g/L is the concentration determined by cone plate rheometer as the gel point for these proteins. The hydrogels that CAHS proteins form are reverse and heat dependent. Therefore, we tested whether heating to induce the breakdown of the hydrogel influenced SH3 folding. We found when heated from 19C to 42C the CAHS proteins went back into solution (the gel state vanished) and there was a return of an SH3 unfolded population. Cooling this solution back down to 19C resulted in re-gelling of the CAHS proteins and a corresponding disappearance of the SH3 unfolded species and an increase in the SH3 folded species. Therefore, it appears that there is a strong correlation between the gelled state of CAHS proteins and their ability to stabilize proteins in a folded state.\nWe are now characterizing the sequence features of CAHS proteins at allow them to form gels. These studies are being conducted by making mutant versions of the proteins and testing their ability to form gels and protect biological materials.\nTesting and Validation for Flight Experiment\nThe bulk of this effort has been made in preparing for and performing our Science Validation Test (SVT-1).\nThe main goal of SVT-1 was to compare the efficacy of culturing tardigrades (Hypsibius exemplasris) using the CellMax and PI Start Kit (PISK).\nSyringes containing ~500 tardigrades or concentrated algae were prepared using the same stock cultures. Syringes were frozen at -80 degrees Celsius and either stored at this temperature or shipped on dry ice to NASA Ames.\nOn May 10th, tardigrades were injected into 3 PISK bioreactors (at NASA Ames) and 3 CellMax Bioreactors (at UNC).\nTemperature control for PISK bioreactors was carried out using integrated temperature control – which varied between ~15 – 17 degrees Celsius. Oxygenation for PISK bioreactors was carried out via gas dosing using medical grade air.\nTemperature control for CellMax bioreactors was carried out by placing the CellMax system in a controlled temperature chamber. The initial temperature used was 15 degrees Celsius, but was changed to 16 degrees Celsius to more closely mirror PISK temperatures. Oxygenation was not controlled, but rather relied on the passive transport of oxygen across the CellMax systems permeable tubing.\nEvery 7 days, up to day 21, subsamples (300 ul) were extracted from both PISK and CellMax bioreactors using syringes. These samples were stored at -80 degrees Celsius. At day 14, fresh algae (food source) was injected into each PISK and CellMax bioreactor. At day 28, the experiment ended and whole bioreactors were detached and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. PISK subsample syringes and bioreactors were returned frozen on dry ice to the Principal Investigator's (PI) lab at UNC.\nUpon receipt at the PI’s lab, samples were transferred from their shipping unit to a -80 degree freezer.\nTo compare the viability of culturing using the PISK, all samples were thawed. For each subsample (300 ul) the entire volume of thawed sample was analyzed by direct observation using a dissecting microscope. Total animal counts were taken and densities calculated. Similarly, for bioreactors, the entire contents of the bioreactor was thawed and transferred to a 15 mL tube. Three 50 ul samples were taken from each tube and total animal counts made and densities calculated.\nThe remaining bioreactor contents was fixed with RNAlater and processed for total RNA extraction.\nTardigrade Densities and Total Counts\nPrior to testing our definition for success was achieving Day 28 animal densities in the PISK bioreactors that were above or within 20% of the densities from our CellMax bioreactors. Our average PISK animal density at Day 28 was 357.8 animals/mL where as our CellMax Day 28 animal density was slightly lower at 282.2 animals/mL. By our original definition, the PISK successfully competed with the CellMax system with regards to effectively culturing tardigrades over a 28 day period.\nREPORTING IN AUGUST 2018\nWe have been preparing for our flight experiment. This has mostly manifested itself in the development of an SRD (Science Requirements Document), protocols, and coordinating with the engineering team who are doing some final tests on our bioreactor setup. Our next step will be to actually get our animals in the hardware and do ground tests.",

            "task_description": "Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) (more recently known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.\nHere we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.\nAim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.\nAim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.\nSignificance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).\nApproach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.\nGround based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.\nInnovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.\nBenefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:\n1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles). This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.\n2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.\nPrior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities."

            "task_progress": "Intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) are among the top health risks associated with long-term space travel. It has been proposed that in microgravity, fluids redistribute, increasing both ICP and OCP leading to visual impairment (VI) after spaceflight. Our original proposal aimed to test the hypothesis that space microgravity increases the proliferation of human neural stem cells (NSCs) and oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), as we previously found using simulated microgravity.\nThis has been an inspirational journey; the Bioscience-4 research project consisted of two spaceflights. Using normal human brain cells, we explored cell division and maintenance of pluripotency for NSCs (the precursors of all cell types that form the brain and spinal cord). We examined the molecules they produced while in the Space Station and their behavior after spaceflight once we brought them back to Earth. Besides studying NSCs, we also ascertained the impact of spaceflight on OLPs, their survival in flight and post-flight, and the specific features that changed in the profile of molecules secreted by them while in space. We also examined their behavior post-flight.\nHere we report great news: both cell types (NSCs and OLPs), survived the roundtrip and preserved their inherent properties. In the case of NSCs, they continued to “self-renew” after spaceflight, remaining pluripotent. This is important because NSCs give rise to neurons for learning and memory in the brain. This augurs well for a healthy brain in our astronauts, ensuring normal cognition and behavior. NSCs also generated astrocytes, one type of glial cell in charge of maintaining the function of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The second cell type we sent to space, “oligodendrocytes”, which are the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system (CNS), also survived and kept their properties in terms of proliferation (cell division) and expression of specific markers, confirming that they remained functional. We found that most cells sent to space remained normal, with the main difference of giving rise to more progenies than those kept in Earth’s gravity.\nWe also compared the molecules secreted by space (SPC)-flown NSCs and OLPs vs. those produced by their ground control counterparts (GC). We were surprised to see that, in general, changes were not as numerous as we expected; several pathways yielded very similar results between GC vs. space-flown cells, indicating that microgravity did not alter the cells’ natural properties. This is also reassuring for long-term space missions to the Moon and Mars. For other pathways, differences were small but significant regarding the abundance of proteins and small molecules between GC and space samples. Both the proteomics and metabolomics analyses allowed us to identify enhanced energetics activity in both NSCs and OLPs that flew to space. Such an increase in energy demands might be caused by cell proliferation. We are happy to report that the defense mechanisms of our cells were in place and responded adequately. For example, typical indicators of cellular stress are the increased expression of stress proteins, also known as heat shock proteins. Although they indicate cellular stress, these proteins are in charge of clearing misfolded proteins, allowing the cell to recover from the stress and synthesize normal proteins for their function. In other words, they indicate the activation of different mechanisms supporting survival and homeostasis in response to the stress produced by spaceflight.\nWe also found a decreased expression of proteins involved in visual function. Transthyretin (TTR) was reduced 4.6, and Calmodulin-2 decreased by 6.1 times in the SPC-NSCs secretome. The most significantly associated pathways include the metabolism of vitamins and cofactors related to visual phototransduction. These findings are important in that, by addressing these changes, visual functions can be maintained. Identifying these changes is just the first step towards mitigating or reversing them.\nWe also found a modest but significant increase in autophagy (paper in preparation), and a fraction of these cells presented larger size, all mechanisms reminiscent of the development of the CNS. Thus, it is not always abnormal, but somewhat necessary to find these behaviors in some cells, particularly when adapting to a different environment.  It is important to note that, at present, we interpret these changes as “stress responses” because nobody has defined how to start identifying “non-stress” changes when referring to cellular responses specific to weightlessness or other gravitational changes. Considering the enormous difference between Earth’s gravity and microgravity, these differences may be suitable and normal. The changes observed by us and others studying life cells exposed to microgravity could also be transient and necessary to maintain both function and homeostasis in the brain. Within their context, they might be considered “normal and necessary” for a healthy transition from Earth’s gravity to different gravity – such as space, the Moon, or Mars.\nAs expected in all pioneer work, our study has some inherent limitations. Although we primarily focused on the effects of microgravity/spaceflight on NSCs and OLPs, other factors may contribute to the changes we observed. Therefore, future studies will have to examine the effects of radiation on both cell types’ proliferation and growth in our SPC-cells when compared to ground controls. For example, it is worth mentioning that experimental studies have shown that high atomic number energy (HZE) nuclei produce both qualitative and quantitative differences in biological effects compared to terrestrial radiation, leading to uncertainty in predicting exposure to health outcomes in humans. Despite all the unknowns, we feel that the key to the modulation of pathways and cell interactions may reside in the changes we observed. Nonetheless, the future for humankind in space appears bright as our work, and that of many other scientists, are identifying molecules and pathways as targets to design preventive measures and countermeasures for our current, future, and past astronauts.",

Most parasitoid wasps of Drosophila attack larval stages of fruit flies and consume the developing host, while growing inside its body. A normal immune response to wasp attack consists of the so-called encapsulation response in which dozens of differentiated blood cells or hemocytes migrate toward the egg to tightly encase, melanize and kill it. Parasitoid wasps produce factors in their venom to disrupt this immune reaction to ensure their success.   In this study we examined the relative success of natural hosts and their parasites reared in space. We also assessed the effects of spaceflight on the immune physiology of Drosophila hosts and on parasite virulence.  Two host strains, without and with inflammatory tumors, and two wasp species, differing in infection strategies were used in the experiment. Using physiological, cellular and molecular readouts, we found:   (a) Flies without tumors and chronic inflammation were more sensitive to spaceflight conditions than tumor-bearing flies suffering from inflammation. Many essential genes in ‘healthy’ flies were downregulated. (b) Spaceflight spiked the expression of inflammation genes in fruit flies of both strains; space-travel enhanced tumor growth in tumor-bearing flies; larval progeny of these ‘space’ flies showed a higher tumor burden and were more strongly immune reactive than ‘ground’ controls. (c) Spaceflight did not significantly affect parasitic wasp development, emergence, or the expression of virulence genes; (d) Parasite mutants of one wasp species with defects in wing color, wing shape, and ovipositor morphology were identified and obtained.  Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to human and animal health during spaceflight. Our studies reveal the unique and shared effects of spaceflight on the physiology and gene expression on distinct strains of Drosophila hosts. They show that metazoan parasites retain their infection strategies in space and highlight the resilience of parasite development in the space environment.",

Distant relatives of these parasitic wasps are used for biocontrol of agricultural pests worldwide.\nThe \"Earth benefits\" impact of our research are as follows:\n(a)  RNA-Seq analysis of adult fruit flies (wild type and mutants developing inflammatory microtumors) will help in understanding the effects of spaceflight in humans and develop countermeasures for immune dysfunction.\n(b) RNA-Seq analysis of parasite transcriptomes in response to spaceflight with emphasis on virulence-related genes is providing novel insights into how endoparasites (those that develop within their hosts) react to the pressures as they develop in low Earth orbit.\nWhereas RNA-Seq-based gene expression analysis is now a standard experimental approach in biomedical research, the paucity of space-related research opportunities applied to model organisms have not allowed the potential of such ‘omics’ approaches to be realized toward spaceflight experiments. Our studies of this unique host-parasite system are among the first of their kind and will provide foundational data and resources for future studies.\n(c) In addition, the isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understating of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology. Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The space environment is likely to have as yet unknown impacts on the animal immune function; refining our understanding of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space.\n(d) Four undergraduate students and one post-doctoral fellow were trained over last year.

            "task_progress": "Whereas previous spaceflight experiments in model organisms – such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and in humans – have shown that the immune system function in space is compromised, similar studies examining the immune system’s interaction with natural pathogens and parasites in space have not been undertaken. With increased investments and opportunities in spaceflight, space travel by humans is becoming more frequent and will even be the norm in the years to come. In this context, it is important to ask how spaceflight affects natural pathogens and parasites in model organisms and in human hosts, especially if the hosts have dysfunctional immunity or are immune-compromised. To address this question, we examined the effects of spaceflight in Drosophila melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to-and-back from the International Space Station, aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission in the spring of 2018.\nParasitoid wasps are obligate parasites of their insect hosts. Most parasitoid wasps of Drosophila attack larval stages of fruit flies and consume the developing host, while growing inside its body. A normal immune response to wasp attack consists of the so-called encapsulation response in which dozens of differentiated blood cells or hemocytes migrate toward the egg to tightly encase, melanize, and kill it. Parasitoid wasps produce factors in their venom to disrupt this immune reaction to ensure their success.\nThe experimental design of our project consisted of two host strains, tumor-free flies with normal immunity (control flies), and mutant flies with chronic inflammatory tumors, due to hyperactive immunity (CI flies). Each of these hosts was infected by either of two wasp species (fly-host co-cultures), that differ in their infection strategies. One wasp species modifies the shapes of hemocytes, whereas the other kills hemocytes, to block encapsulation and gain control over the host. Hemocytes fight off wasp infections by making up the wasp capsules. Parasite-free flies (fly-only cultures) were also included in the experiments as controls.\nWe examined (a) the relative success of hosts versus parasites, (b) the effects of spaceflight on the immune physiology of Drosophila hosts, and (c) the effects of spaceflight on parasite virulence itself. We also searched for the detrimental effects of space radiation on wasp morphology. Using physiological, cellular, and molecular readouts of the space-returned animals and their corresponding ground controls, we found:\n(a) Fewer than expected control flies returned to Earth, while the tumor-bearing CI flies succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. Thus, tumor-free control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight conditions than CI flies. This result is counter-intuitive and unexpected. Molecular analysis revealed that in the tumor-free control flies (but not in the mutant CI flies), many genes important for essential life functions were downregulated. Furthermore, the orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. In both fly strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins), that contribute to cuticle and chorion structures, were strongly affected in space.\n(b) Spaceflight spiked the expression of inflammation genes in fruit flies of both control and CI strains; space travel enhanced tumor growth in tumor-bearing flies; larval progeny of these ‘space’ flies showed a higher tumor burden and were more strongly immune reactive than ‘ground’ controls. In addition, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains and even though the control flies did not develop tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased.\n(c) Surprisingly, spaceflight did not significantly affect parasitic wasp development, or their emergence. In addition, the effects on the expression of virulence genes was also not significant. In one of the two wasp species, virulence particles were seen normally distributed within the hosts. Together these results suggest that the effects of the space stressors on the parasite, that develops within the fly host, are quite modest.\n(d) Orbiting ~400 kilometer above Earth, life in the International Space Station is subjected to somewhat higher levels of space radiation than organisms on Earth are. In this research project, we identified two parasite mutants of one of the two wasp species. These mutants show defects in wing color, wing shape, and ovipositor morphology. To identify these mutants, we examined the grandsons of the male wasps born in space. A mutant that affects wing color (aurum, for golden wings, instead of the normal grey wings) breeds true, while the other mutant in which wing shape is affected (kona, angular wing shape relative to the normal round edge), cannot lay eggs in hosts due to structural defects in the ovipositor. These genetic variants are the only live mutant strains for this class of parasites and will be useful for research on host-parasite interaction studies on Earth.  Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to human and animal health during spaceflight. Our studies reveal the unique and shared effects of spaceflight on the physiology and gene expression on distinct strains of Drosophila hosts. They show that metazoan parasites retain their infection strategies in space and highlight the resilience of parasite development in the space environment. Continued analysis of such systems, using model hosts and their various parasites, will help establish multigenerational studies and obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.",

            "task_description": "Ed. NOTE (June 2015): Continuation of \"Sporesat Mission: Investigating biophysical mechanisms of plant gravisensing using a lab-on-a-chip approach\"--grant NNX11AF48A for SporeSat 2.\nSporeSat is a Small Complete Mission based on a Mission of Opportunity-2 nanosatellite designed for real time measurement of calcium signaling and maintenance of variable gravity treatments during flight.  The impetus for SporeSat is to gain a deeper knowledge of the molecular and biophysical mechanisms for plant gravity sensing by studying the activation of cell gravity-sensing and electrophysiological signaling in the single-cell model system, Ceratopteris richardii, using a novel ‘lab-on-a-chip’ microsensor technology platform called a CEL-C advanced bioCD.\nThe science and technical objectives as outlined in the original SporeSat proposal:\nScience Objectives:  1) Determine gravity thresholds for Ca2+ channel activation in wild-type spores; 2) Observe Ca2+ current response of gene knockout mutants.\nTechnology Objectives: 1) Design and fabricate the CEL-C advanced bioCD; 2) Integrate bioCD with data acquisition hardware and ground-based validation experiments; 3) Develop and integrate centrifuge hardware; 4) Operate bioCD in space-relevant environment; 5) Conduct spaceflight experiments.\nIn 2013, SporeSat was adapted to a 2 flight mission strategy with flight 1 focused on the technology objectives and flight 2 focused on the scientific objectives.  In April 2014, SporeSat-1 was deployed from a SpaceX Falcon 9 launched from Cape Canaveral as part of CRS-3.  SporeSat-1 was successfully commanded and science data downloaded.  However, the OLED light source failed and one of the three bioCDs overheated (40C) above its target set point (29C).  These issues were addressed by the Ames engineering team via a Failure Review Board process.\nSporeSat1 also faced other technical challenges related to the biology.  At the time of SporeSat1, the strain of spore that had been used for all prior gravity modulated calcium measurements, Hn-n, was not physically available anywhere in the world.  Instead the next best strain, Rn5, was used but was limited by a lack of prior calcium data as well as reduced germination rates due to age of spore batch (~5 years). In addition, the available methods of generating the desired caclium mutants were not reliable.  Since that time, Co-Principal Investigator Stan Roux and Mari Salmi produced new batches of Hn-n spores and new methods of genetic manipulation of spores became available.\nAmong the improvements made prior to SporeSat2 was an improved bioCD enclosed assembly (EA) wall design.  The first SporeSat EA wall design contained an agar volume that was determined to be insufficient for the fern spores during storage.  The EA walls and spore wells were redesigned to increase the agar volume available for each spore and was used in SporeSat-1 flight and ground controls.  The new design, while an improvement for the spores, created an unintentional electrical coupling of the Ca2+ sensors.  In addition this change in wall design may have contributed to the moisture leakage that was involved in OLED and temperature control failure. We therefore created a design upgrade for SporeSat-2 that retained a higher agar volume but that electrically isolated the spore wells and Ca2+ electrode pairs.\nIn November of 2014 SporeSat2 began and was parsed into a Phase I (ground) and Phase II (flight).  The primary goal of Phase I was to demonstrate that the Hn-n and/or Rn5 fern spores exhibit a reliable and repeatable Ca2+ current that is measureable by the bioCD during germination under ideal ground conditions.   In this report we focus on the major accomplishments achieved during the Jan 2015 – May 2016 period which encompassed SporeSat2 Phase 1.\nThe SporeSat-2 experimental paradigm and geometry is different from any previous experimental set ups. As in any biosensor experiment, the Ca2+ ISEs are sampling at a particular location in space and time, a dynamic calcium current that exists across the 3D surface of the fern spore. To assist in development of the biological model based on sensor recordings, we have developed a 3D simulation model that predicts the 3D calcium concentration profiles in the SporeSat wells as well as the sensor recordings over time based on the biological flux from the fern spore. We will therefore be able to compare our experimental data with our predictions for different conditions (angle off gravity, under rotation) as well as for different calcium mutants.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Astronaut health in long term space missions is likely to be dependent on and benefit from plants. On Earth we depend on plants for food, clean air, and waste treatment. The same will be true in space. If we as humans are to achieve the kind of space exploration and habitation that we all imagine and dream of, we are going to need plants up there with us. Yet on the International Space Station (ISS), gravity is less than one one-thousandth of the gravity here on Earth. On the Moon, it is about 17% of Earth's gravity. In addition, there are astonishing similarities in signaling within cells across species. As in plants, calcium plays important roles in human cell development, function, and dysfunction. Understanding gravity sensing in plant cells is likely to give clues to gravity sensing in other organisms including humans. In addition, the technology that we developed for these experiments establishes a platform to ask other questions regarding human cell responses on Earth and in space. We are already looking at how we can adapt the technology to study pancreatic beta cells and diabetes."

            "task_progress": "Elucidation of the mechanisms by which living cells sense and respond to variable gravity is fundamentally important to the advancement of human space exploration, and calcium is an important mediator of cell signal transduction in all organisms. In plants, environmental factors as diverse as temperature, light, touch, and gravity induce an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, and this, in turn, initiates signalling cascades leading to adaptive physiological changes. Calcium signalling has long been known to play a role in both the earliest stage of gravity perception and the transmission of the signal in gravity-directed polar development.\nSpores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii are a valuable system for studying cellular gravity response. Each spore is a single cell, and before the first division of the cell, the orientation of cellular polarity is set in response to the force exerted on the cell by gravity. The mechanism of gravity response in the spore cell includes the transport of calcium into and out of the cell. Soon after the spore germination process begins, calcium is transported out of the cell, against its concentration gradient, on the sides and top of the spore, with peak efflux of calcium at the top of the spore. At the same time, calcium is transported into the spore at the bottom. This polarized orientation of calcium transport is directly linked to the force and orientation of gravity as demonstrated in lab-on-a-chip experiments that monitored the calcium differential while the spores were reoriented relative to gravity, and also while the spore experienced varying g-forces onboard parabolic flight.  The direction of calcium transport in the spore cell results in a cell polarization that ultimately correlates with the direction of rhizoid growth.\nMeasurement of the gavity-induced calcium polarization over longer developmental time periods is necessary to assess the effect of gravitational magnitude and to measure the minimum threshold of gravity necessary to set the cell’s developmental polarity.  In order to measure polarized calcium signals from fern spores over long periods of germination time (hours) in varying gravity, we designed a second-generation lab-on-a-chip device that supports on-disk electrical measurement during rotation, referred to here as a bioCD. The bioCD can be operated autonomously under continuous rotation or while stationary during space flight in a free-flying nanosatellite, known as SporeSat.  SporeSat (5.5 kg, 10x10x34 cm) can be carried to space as a secondary payload and inserted into low Earth orbit at altitudes ranging from 350 to 750 km).  It builds on the design of previous small satellite missions to measure the effects of microgravity on living organisms.\nIn this work period we demonstrated the ability to calibrate the calcium response of single cell fern spores subject to hypergravity while on Earth in a single experiment.  The bioCD with supporting hardware measures calcium ion concentration ratios indicative of the polarization of transcellular ion currents in single cells under varying artificial gravity created by rotation.  We optimized the function of the on chip amplifiers to reduce noise, implemented statistical methods for rigorously identifying the positive biological signals, and improved the well quality control procedures.  These improvements enabled the reliable measurement of gravity induced calcium signals on a single bioCD.\nWe demonstrated the system’s function as an autonomous programmable experiment on Earth by measuring calcium concentration differentials around single-cell fern spores.  We measured the first calibration of these differentials as a function of gravity magnitude during a full 24 hours of rotation following light-induced germination.   Long-term hypergravity stimulation resulted in an electrochemical signal that is similar in charge orientation differential to that previously reported in response to very short term hypergravity stimulation. This gravitational force-induced cellular signal is significantly different from the negative controls. The magnitude of this signal increases with increasing net gravity.\nThe novel and most valuable aspect of the SporeSat free-flying nanosatellite design is that it will provide multiple gravitational levels for spores during development in microgravity. The most common methodologies for experiments aimed at understanding cell, organ, or whole organism mechanisms of gravity perception involve randomization of the gravity vector on Earth. While these experiments are useful and necessary, the SporeSat nanosatellite provides a platform for a true microgravity experiment with simulated gravity controls. In addition, the biological system used provides important electrochemical information about the mechanism a single cell uses to detect the subtle force of gravity.\nThe SporeSat bioCD can now be used as an important tool to evaluate the contribution of individual gene targets to this gravity-induced electrochemical signal. It can also be used to determine the minimum gravitational force needed to activate a single cell response.",

NOTE (June 2015): Continuation for SporeSat 2 of \"Sporesat Mission: Investigating biophysical mechanisms of plant gravisensing using a lab-on-a-chip approach\"--grant NNX11AF48A.\nSporeSat is a Small Complete Mission based on a Mission of Opportunity-2 nanosatellite designed for real time measurement of calcium signaling and maintenance of variable gravity treatments during flight. The impetus for SporeSat is to gain a deeper knowledge of the molecular and biophysical mechanisms for plant gravity sensing by studying the activation of cell gravity-sensing and electrophysiological signaling in the single-cell model system, Ceratopteris richardii, using a novel ‘lab-on-a-chip’ microsensor technology platform called a CEL-C advanced bioCD.\nIn 2013, SporeSat was adapted into a 2 flight mission strategy with flight 1 focused on the technology objectives and flight 2 focused on the scientific objectives. In April 2014, SporeSat-1 was deployed from a SpaceX Falcon 9 launched from Cape Canaveral as part of CRS-3. SporeSat-1 was successfully commanded and science data downloaded.\nIn late 2012, the original SporeSat Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Marshall Porterfield, was tapped as the director of NASA’s Space Life and Physical Sciences Research and Applications Division. Because SporeSat falls under this division at NASA, due to conflict of interest, Dr. Porterfield was replaced as PI with his close research collaborator and fellow expert in physiological sensing and biosensor technology, Dr. Jenna Rickus. Due to the increased emphasis on the Science Objectives for SporeSat-2, Drs. Stan Roux (original co-Investigator) and Rickus will serve as Co-Principal Investigators for SporeSat-2. Dr. Rickus will lead all aspects of the bioCD design, performance, and production at Purdue and Dr. Roux (at University of Texas Austin) will lead all biological aspects of the project particularly that related to experimental design and interpretation of the experimental data as well as setting the science requirements for the SporeSat-2 mission.\nAt the time of loading for SporeSat-1 the Hn-n Ceratopteris richardii spores were not available; therefore, Rn5 spores from the University of Texas (UT) were used. In the SporeSat 2 mission we will use the now available Hn-n spore strain that was used in all previous calcium current studies prior to SporeSat. Using the Hn-n from UT Austin and the upgraded SporeSat-2 hardware we will record ground based calcium currents in stationary positions (variable = angle off gravity) and under rotation (variable = artificial gravity magnitude). In addition, as mutant spores become available we will integrate the mutants into the experiments.\nThe SporeSat-2 experimental paradigm and geometry is different from any previous experimental set ups. As in any biosensor experiment, the Ca2+ ISEs are sampling at a particular location in space and time, a dynamic calcium current that exists across the 3D surface of the fern spore. To assist in development of the biological model based on sensor recordings, we have developed a 3D simulation model that predicts the 3D calcium concentration profiles in the SporeSat wells as well as the sensor recordings over time based on the biological flux from the fern spore. We will therefore be able to compare our experimental data with our predictions for different conditions (angle off gravity, under rotation) as well as for different calcium mutants.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Astronaut health in long term space missions is likely to be dependent on and benefit from plants. On Earth we depend on plants for food, clean air, and waste treatment. The same will be true in space. If we as humans are to achieve the kind of space exploration and habitation that we all imagine and dream of, we are going to need plants up there with us. Yet on the International Space Station (ISS), gravity is less than one one-thousandth of the gravity here on Earth. On the Moon, it is about 17% of Earth's gravity. In addition, there are astonishing similarities in signaling within cells across species. As in plants, calcium plays important roles in human cell development, function, and dysfunction. Understanding gravity sensing in plant cells is likely to give clues to gravity sensing in other organisms including humans. In addition, the technology that we developed for these experiments establishes a platform to ask other questions regarding human cell responses on Earth and in space. We are already looking at how we can adapt the technology to study pancreatic beta cells and diabetes."

            "task_progress": "Summary of Research Accomplished for NNX15AB85A\nTitle:  SporeSat Mission: Investigating Biophysical Mechanisms of Plant Gravisensing Using a Lab-on-a Chip Approach\nA key objective of the SporeSat project was to produce a next generation lab-on-a-chip device to be used in microgravity to determine the minimum g force needed to activate the calcium channel that regulates calcium ion transport in spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii. In addition, the original proposal included the objective of observing the calcium current response of gene knockout mutants. Through the first SporeSat project and the Phase one activities of SporeSat-2, we have achieved many of the Technical Objectives described in the SporeSat proposal, which we will describe here under five headings. We also add a final Significance section that summarizes the importance of the discoveries made.\nLight Initiation of Spore Germination: We determined that 1 hour of light is sufficient to initiate the germination of Ceratopteris spores and allow the gravity-directed polarization process to proceed through 24 hours. This assures that the battery power planned for the light treatment in the SporeSat mission will easily suffice. Spores require an additional light exposure between 28 and 40 hours after the first light treatment to complete germination, but the calcium ion transport investigated in the SporeSat mission occurs within the first 24 hours of development. These new data provide important evidence that the photoreceptor and irradiance needed to initiate the calcium current are present during the first hour of light treatment planned.\nSpore and Media Loading: Early in phase one of SporeSat-2 we found that the loading method used allowed the spores to dry after hydration, which resulted in inhibition or significant delay in germination. To solve this loading problem scientists at the Ames Research Center (ARC) implemented the use of a capillary pipette and micromanipulator for spore loading and adapted an off the shelf 3D printer to automatically load agar germination media into the wells. These improvements resulted in spore loading time of 2-4 hours, and complete filling of greater than 50% of wells without bubbles. We determined that complete loading of the well with germination media without bubbles is necessary for resolution of the BioCD signal.\nGermination Media Calcium Content: We determined that the agar media with the lowest background calcium concentration that supported both normal spore germination and strong electrochemical signals from spores was Noble agar, which had a background [Ca2+] of ~280 µM, and this became the agar of choice for the successful test run we completed in April (Zero Day Test 12).     Success in Detecting Gravity-Directed Electrical Signals from Spores: Thanks to the reduced background Ca2+ in the agar, improvements in spore loading, and an improvement made to the signal detection software, we have developed an effective BioCd. Dr. Rickus was able to detect statistically significant electrical signal from spore cells that increases with g-force, and is different from negative controls in Zero Day test #12. This success replicated results observed in prior Zero Day tests, but with a dramatic reduction in noise and increase in signal stability.  These results, which have now been published (Park et al., 2017--see Bibliography section), indicate that spore, spore loading, and instrument conditions have been found that reproducibly confirm that the bioCD can record significant electrical signals in the spore that are induced by gravity. The likelihood that these signals are due to changes in calcium transport is very high.\nMutant Plant Development: The original SporeSat proposal included the objective of generating knockout mutant spores for the Ceratopteris Ca2+ ATPase (CrACA1) and Annexin (AnnCr1 and AnnCr2) genes. At this time we have generated mutant sporophyte plants that possess short hairpin constructs designed to reduce or suppress the expression of the CrACA1 and AnnCr2 genes. In addition to these mutant plants, we have also generated mutant sporophyte plants that possess short hairpin constructs designed to suppress the expression of genes that encode a Mechanosensitive Channel of Small Conductance (CrMscS) and the ubiquitous calcium regulatory protein Calmodulin (CrCaM). We have also generated sporophyte plants that are up-regulated in the expression of the AnnCr2 and CrMscS genes. We have currently verified three plants with significant increase in transcript abundance of AnnCr2 and three plants with significant decrease in transcript abundance of AnnCr2.  We have also verified that one plant has significant increase in transcript abundance of CrMscS. We have collected spores from all of these plants.\nSignificance\nAn elegant aspect of the SporeSat design is the inclusion of variable g force control within a microgravity experiment. The implementation of this aspect of the design was demonstrated in the first SporeSat mission, and this success will help assure the success of SporeSat-2. The BioCD platform used for these studies could easily be adapted for studies of gravity responses in other cell types, such as bone and muscle cells. The major technical advances already made in this SporeSat grant and the new ones that a Phase 2 project could achieve, will greatly facilitate its adaptation for other gravitational studies in space.  The Ceratopteris mutant studies will allow a first-time genetic dissection of the most rapid responses induced in single cells by gravity. A number of earlier studies have documented the importance of Ca2+ currents for polarized growth and for gravitropic growth, however, there are few prior studies that have identified and genetically analyzed the molecular components of these currents. Moreover, while it is generally accepted that Ca2+ is a second messenger that participates in a myriad of plant responses, there is still little known about the molecular identity of plant Ca2+ channels and the proteins that interact with and help regulate these channels (e.g., annexin). The proposed genetic tests of Ca2+ pump and channel function and regulation may not only provide novel insights into how the gravity-directed Ca2+ current originates, but also to further advance an understanding of channel structures.\nMost of the findings described above were presented in one peer-reviewed, full-length journal publication and/or in three presentations at meetings, which were published as abstracts. These publications are listed in the Bibliography section of this Task Book report.",

            "task_description": "Beneficial microbes play a significant role in the normal development of animal tissues. Through the formation of healthy stable associations between host and symbiont, particularly during post-embryonic development, carefully regulated developmental pathways can be induced.\nIn this experimental research plan, we propose to examine the impact of microgravity on the normal molecular interactions between host and symbiont. To examine these effects we propose to use the model system between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. For over two decades this squid-vibrio model has served as an ideal ecosystem to examine the influences of mutualistic bacteria on animal development. To simulate microgravity, rotating bioreactors called high-aspect-ratio rotating wall vessel bioreactors (HARVs) will be used to provide a low-shear environment for both the host and symbiont, thereby simulating microgravity. Specifically, we propose the following:\nObjective 1. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.\nObjective 2. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria exposure under microgravity conditions.\nObjective 3. Develop a flight-ready microtiter plate for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis in this new hardware.\nThe proposed work has several implications for the field of space biology. First, by examining how normal healthy symbioses are initiated and maintained under microgravity conditions, we can begin to determine the sensitivity of these ecosystems to perturbations in the space environment. Secondly, we can assess the genetic and metabolic responses to gravity in the presence and absence of symbiosis, potentially identifying previously unknown triggers or cues associated with post-embryonic animal development.",

            "task_progress": "A. Project Overview – This project examined the impact of microgravity on commensal, non-pathogenic microbes that associate with animal tissues. To address this issue we conducted an integrative study in which the responses of both animal host and microbe were examined in situ under simulated microgravity conditions. The long-term goal of the research was to assess whether those interactions between animal cells and mutualistic bacteria undergo a significant alteration in cell-cell communication, immune response, and physiology under microgravity conditions. The overall objective of this proposal was to examine the genomic expression patterns of a host symbiotic squid Euprymna scolopes in response to the luminescent bacterial symbiont, Vibrio fischeri. The results of this study helped identify those genetic pathways that are differentially regulated in the host animal in the presence and absence of mutualistic bacteria under simulated microgravity conditions, thereby improving our understanding of human health in the space environment.\nB. Major Findings and Outcomes of Research\n1. The symbiotic V. fischeri appear to modulate the host innate immune and oxidative stress response of the host light organ during modeled microgravity conditions. Using RNA-seq we analyzed the transcriptome of the host light organ (i.e., the site of symbiosis) of the squid in the presence (symbiotic) and absence (aposymbiotic) of beneficial V. fischeri under simulated microgravity conditions. At 12 h post inoculation both the symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with hemocyanin, oxidative stress, and the innate immune system. However, by 24 h post inoculation only the aposymbiotic animals exhibited an upregulated stress response, whereas those animals exposed to V. fischeri no longer showed the stress response suggesting that V. fischeri is helping to modulate the host response. Results were published in Casaburi et al., 2017 – See cumulative bibliography for citation; reported in FY2018 report.\n2. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shedding by V. fischeri is increased under simulated microgravity conditions. Under modeled microgravity conditions V. fischeri releases a statistically higher amount of the virulence factor LPS, known to cause apoptosis and inflammation in both mutualistic and pathogenic microbes. The LPS production is primarily associated with flagellar movement and by knocking out flagellar production and motion the amount of LPS produced under both microgravity and gravity conditions was reduced. However, even with the removal of the flagella, the LPS shedding was still statistically higher in modeled microgravity conditions compared to gravity conditions. We have ascertained that under modeled microgravity the V. fischeri membrane integrity is compromised and is more susceptible to antibiotic treatment. We are examining whether we can further inhibit the differential shedding of LPS under modeled microgravity conditions.\n3. Sequencing and closure of the Euprymna scolopes genome revealed two evolutionary mechanisms for symbiotic organ evolution.  Using the RNA-seq data generated during this project we generated a reference transcriptome for the host animal and use that as a scaffold to close the genome of E. scolopes. Although this task was not originally part of our project goals the data was invaluable in providing a closed genome for the squid-vibrio research community. Analysis of the genome and reference transcriptome revealed that there are two distinctive evolutionary processes associated with the origin of symbiotic organs in animals. A manuscript is currently in press at PNAS.\n4. Modeled microgravity alters the innate immune pathway of host squid. Using the new technique NanoString, we complemented the previously generated transcriptomes by analyzing the differential gene expression along additional time points (0, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24 h) and have generated a new model of the receptor and signal cascade of the innate immune system. We have also determined that modeled microgravity impacts the expression of the innate immune genes and we have identified key parts of the pathway that are being disrupted. (Publication in preparation.)\n5. Modeled microgravity does not significantly alter the transcriptome of the symbiont V. fischeri; however, the global regulatory gene hfq is critical to regulate the bacterial stress responses in low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). The transcriptome of the bacterial symbiont was examined during both exponential and stationary phase growth and results indicated that modeled microgravity had no significant impact on gene expression at 12 and 24 h. However, when the global regulator gene hfq was deleted from the bacteria, there was a pronounced change in gene expression under LSMMG conditions. There was a dramatic increase in the number of transcripts associated with TCA cycling and stress responses suggesting that the Hfq protein serves as a critical regulator for the bacteria under modeled microgravity conditions.

These visual disturbances have been hypothesized to be related to increases in intracranial pressure. Increases in intracranial pressure associated with spaceflight are thought to occur through the cephalad shift of intravascular and cerebrospinal fluids due to the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector present on Earth. In regard to the vascular component, increases in cerebral blood flow and capillary fluid filtration could elevate fluid movement into the cranium, while impaired function of cerebral veins and lymphatics could impede intracranial fluid drainage out of the cranium. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to examine the effects of long-term spaceflight on the vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties of cerebral arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels.\nFlight: The aim of this project is to investigate whether spaceflight on the ISS alters the blood-brain barrier in rodents, as indicated by ultrastructural examination of the cerebral capillary endothelium. To assess the changes that occur in the structure of the blood-brain barrier, 10-15 female C57BL/6 mice, 10-11 weeks old will be loaded into a transporter (Animal Enclosure Module AEM-T; 10 mice/side), and late-loaded into a SpaceX Dragon rocket. After ascent and docking to the ISS, the mice will be transferred via an Animal Access Unit (AAU) and Mouse Transfer Box (MTB) to 2 Habitats (AEM-X). The mice will be grouped into four experimental groups, each housed in one side of an AEM-X. The groups, as determined by another investigation, will consist of mice receiving intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline vehicle (n=5), Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine (n=5), CpG ODN adjuvant (n=5), or TT vaccine + CpG ODN adjuvant (n=5).\nAfter mice have been exposed to microgravity for a minimum of 2 weeks, animals for this study will be inoculated with an injection of phosphate buffered saline (n=5) or CpG ODN adjuvant (n=5); a third group of animals injected with the TT vaccine (n=5) may be utilized. Two weeks later (14 +/- 2 days), the mice will be sacrificed in the Materials Science Glovebox (MSG). Sacrificing will be achieved via i.p. injection of 100/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine anesthesia followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Following blood collection and harvest of spleen for another research investigation, the animals will have heads removed. The top of the skull will be cut along the sagittal crest and suture and retracted back to expose the brain. The brains will be will be dissected from the mice and put in a solution of 10% buffered formalin at ambient temperature. 24-48 hours later, the 10% buffered formalin will be exchanged with the Brain Fixation Kit (BFK) to 70% Ethanol and stored at ambient temperature until they can be returned to Earth and analyzed.\nGround: 20-25 (saline vehicle (n=10), Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine (n=5), CpG ODN adjuvant (n=10)) ground control mice will be put in AEMs inside Orbiter Environmental Simulators (OES) on a 2-8 day delay, depending on the when telemetry data from the SpaceX Dragon and ISS environments are available. The differences in vascular structure between ground controls and flight animals with a P-value < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.",

            "task_progress": "[Ed. note: Compiled from final report submitted October 2020 to NASA Ames Research Center]\nExperimental Approach: Male mice were studied as part of the Rodent Research 9 (RR-9) mission, which was launched on SpaceX-12 in August, 2017. The animals were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) where they remained for approximately 33 days before being returned to Earth. The vascular physiology experiments with the Flight animals and a group of Vivarium Control mice were conducted at Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, California, in October, 2017. Habitat Ground Control (HC) and Vivarium Control (VC) studies were conducted at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida in July, 2018.\nResults:\nAim 1. To determine whether spaceflight on the ISS alters rodent basilar artery spontaneous tone, myogenic and KCl-evoked vasoconstriction, mechanical stiffness and gross structure. Histological measurements of basilar artery gross vascular structure (e.g., medial wall thickness and intraluminal diameter) did not show significant differences between RR-9 flight mice (FLT) and control mice. However, basilar arteries from the FLT mice had lower smooth muscle cell (SM22a) and endothelial cell (CD31) expression relative to that in controls, indicating the proportional composition of the basilar artery was altered by spaceflight. These changes in the proportional composition of the basilar artery did not alter the passive mechanical behavior or stiffness of the artery.\nThe changes in the structural composition of the basilar artery did, however, appear to have functional consequences to both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responsiveness. Similar to the results previously found in mouse basilar arteries flown on the Space Shuttle STS-135 and BionM1 missions, we found that basilar arteries in the RR-9 flight mice showed diminished vasoconstrictor responses to KCl, a non-receptor agonist, and U46619, a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist, relative to that in the Habitat Control mice (Hab) and Vivarium Control mice (FViv+KSCViv). This reduction in both non-receptor and receptor-mediated vasoconstriction is associated with the diminished expression of smooth muscle cells in the basilar artery.\nVasodilation mediated through basilar artery endothelial cells via acetylcholine was diminished in the Spaceflight (SF) mice relative to that in the Habitat Control mice (HC) and Vivarium Control mice (VC). These results are in agreement with results obtained with mice flown on the Bion-M1 mission, where a single maximal dose of acetylcholine showed lower endotheliummediated vasodilation in SF mice relative to that in HC and VC mice. Smooth muscle, endothelium-independent vasodilation via the nitric oxide donor diethylamine NONOate diethylammonium (DEA/NO) was also lower in basilar arteries from the SF mice compared to control animals. These data indicate that both endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation of cerebral arteries are compromised by spaceflight.\nTo examine possible mechanisms for the impaired vasodilator responses, we used immunofluorescence to examine the expression of basilar artery: 1) endothelial nitric oxide  synthase (eNOS) expression, the enzyme responsible for generating the vasodilator molecule nitric oxide, 2) superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression, an anti-oxidant enzyme, and 3) prooxidant enzyme expression of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) and xanthine oxidase (XO). The results indicated that eNOS expression in the basilar artery did not differ between FLT and control mice. However, expression of the anti-oxidant enzyme SOD was lower in the FLT mice and expression of the pro-oxidant enzyme XO was higher; NOX2 expression was not different between groups. These data indicate that spaceflight elevates oxidative stress in cerebral arteries through reductions in anti-oxidant protection and increases in production of reactive oxygen species.\nAim 2. To estimate whether spaceflight on the ISS alters the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rodents, as indicated by ultrastructural examination of the junctional complex of the  cerebral capillary endothelium. Two astrocyte biomarkers were used to examine the integrity and function of the BBB and microvessel damage: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4). GFAP is present in the soma and astrocytic process and serves as a target protein for immunohistochemical detection of astrocytes. AQP4 is a water channel protein concentrated at the luminal surfaces of astrocyte end-feet, which outline the vascular bed to which they attach. Immunohistochemical analysis of the mouse brain revealed a significant increase in expression of AQP4 in the Flight mice (FLT) compared to that in Ground Control mice (GC).\nTissue expression of ZO-1 and PECAM-1 in the brain were evaluated. There was a significant decrease in the expression of the BBB-related tight junction protein ZO-1 and an increase in the expression of PECAM-1. Like those of AQP4, these results also indicate a disturbance in the integrity of the BBB.\nUsing immunohistochemical methods to determine the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the brain, quantitative assessment of brain sections demonstrated that spaceflight caused a 2.2-fold increase in apoptotic cells in the hippocampus of FLT mice compared to that in GC groups. Collectively, these results demonstrate spaceflight-induced apoptosis in the brain (TUNELpositive cells) and evoked changes in the expression of BBB-related proteins, AQP-4, ZO-1 and PECAM-1, indicate a disruption in the integrity and compromised function of the BBB.\nAim 3. To determine whether spaceflight on the ISS alters rodent sagittal sinus vein (inside cranium) and jugular vein (outside cranium) spontaneous tone, myogenic and NE-evoked constriction, distension and gross structure. Using in vitro methods, the maximal passive diameter (4 cmH2O) of the jugular vein was  determined in RR-9 Flight, Habitat Control, and Vivarium control mice. The maximal diameter was smaller in Flight mice relative to that in the control groups. Additionally, jugular wall thickness was thinner in FLT mice relative to that in Control animals. The combination of both a decrease in maximal diameter and a thinning of the medial smooth muscle layer in the jugular vein of FLT mice resulted in a reduction in the intima-media cross-sectional area.\nUsing immunofluorescent histology to determine the smooth muscle cell (SM22a) and endothelial cell (CD31) composition of the jugular vein, the results indicate a non-significant decrease in SM22a expression and a significant decrease in CD31 expression in jugular veins from FLT mice relative to that in Controls, indicating the composition of the jugular was altered by spaceflight. Collectively, such changes in the gross structural characteristics and composition of the jugular vein could have functional consequences on vein function and ultimately blood flow through the vessel.\nIn vitro studies were conducted to determine the effects of spaceflight on the functional vasoconstrictor properties of the jugular vein. The data suggest that spaceflight enhances the  venoconstrictor response of jugular veins to norepinephrine as well as myogenic venoconstrictor tone across a range of intravascular pressures. Such adaptations could serve to promote venous congestion in the head and contribute to possible elevations in intracranial pressure.\nTo determine whether spaceflight-induced reductions in endothelial cell release of nitric oxide or alterations in reactive oxygen species might be associated with the increase in venoconstrictor tone of the jugular veins, we used immunofluorescence to examine the expression of eNOS, SOD, NOX2, and XO in the jugular vein. The results indicated a reduction of eNOS expression in the jugular veins of FLT mice, but no difference in the expression of the anti-oxidant enzyme SOD or the expression of the pro-oxidant enzymes NOX2 and XO. These results suggest the enhanced venoconstrictor tone of the jugular veins from FLT mice could be in part the result of fewer endothelial cells lining the jugular vein and diminished basal release of NO through the eNOS signaling pathway.\nFinally, we did not find any differences in the maximal diameter or markers of smooth muscle cell (SM22a) and endothelial cell (CD31) composition of the sagittal sinus vein between FLT and Control mice. These results indicate that venous vessel adaptations to spaceflight may be different within and outside the cranium.\nAim 4. To determine whether spaceflight on the ISS alters the ability of the cervical lymphatics modulate lymph flow, and thus, regulate cerebral fluid homeostasis. In vitro studies of isolated cervical pre-nodal lymphatics were conducted to determine whether spaceflight alters the functional properties of lymphatic vessels of the head and neck. The data  indicate that spaceflight increases the passive diameter of cervical lymphatics by 10-15%, increases vessel tone by approximately 50%, elevates the pumping frequency by approximately 75%, and overall results in an increase in pump function by approximately 20-25%. Mechanistically, the overall elevation in pump function may be the result of alterations in the flow/shear-dependent responses of cervical lymphatic vessels, which can serve to enhance pump frequency, amplitude and flow in lymphatic vessels.\nIn addition to cervical lymphatic vessels, we examined the gross structural properties of meningeal lymphatics, which unlike the cervical lymphatics of the neck, reside within the  cranium. We found both an increase in wall thickness and maximal diameter of meningeal lymphatic vessels. These data suggest that both pressure and flow within the intracranial  lymphatics are elevated with spaceflight.",

            "task_description": "This project combines aspects of  two proposals that were selected for funding: “Effects of microgravity on lymphatic proliferation and transport efficiency in the gastrointestinal system of C57/BL6 mice” (#14-14SF_Step2-0079) and “Tissue Sharing (B7): Effects of Microgravity Adaptations on Cephalic Lymphatic Function and Associated Edema Development and Immune Dysfunction” (#14-14SF_Step2-0092). Both of these proposals have at their basis the idea that long-term space flight inhibits lymphatic function, which will impair the transport of immune cells, fluids, and macromolecules from the interstitium. This lymphatic inhibition could affect many aspects of astronaut health, especially upper body edema, CSF (cerebralspinal fluid) pressure regulation, visual acuity loss, gastrointestinal dysfunction/inflammation, and immune impairment due to diminished transport of fluid, large molecules, and immune cell transport to and from the nodes.\nThe visual acuity disturbances from space flight are thought to be related to the increases in intracranial pressure because of the space flight induced cephalic fluid shift. Cephalic lymphatic function has been intimately linked to the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure via the lymphatic removal of CSF through the cribriform plate. The cribriform plate and associated lymphatic network moves lymph derived from CSF towards the cervical lymph nodes en route to the veins of the neck. This provides part of a multi-faceted CSF pressure regulatory mechanism as well as a modulator of neurological immunity. We will study the role of the cephalic lymphatic network in CSF pressure dysfunction and the assessment of correlative immunological components.\nSpace flight is also known to cause alterations in the development and function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This is associated with lymphostasis, gut edema, reduced fat deposition in the mesentery, and visceral organs, and reduced size of immune associated organs, similar to what is seen in intestinal lymphangiectasia. All of these symptoms are also found in patients with GI inflammation. Intestinal inflammation has not been studied in human subjects during space flight, but we have seen that simulated space flight resulted in the development of intestinal inflammation in animal models. However, this has not been measured in the same space-flown animal model. The role of GI lymphatic dysfunction, which is likely a causative factor in many of these pathologies has NEVER been systematically assessed.\nThus we propose that space flight induced lymphatic dysfunction is responsible for the development of edema and inflammation in multiple tissues, specifically producing dysfunction in CSF pressure regulation and GI function. The previous applications both proposed to test this general hypothesis using very similar experimental protocols applied to the head/neck and GI tissues respectively for #14-14SF_Step2-0092 and #14-14SF_Step2-0079. In the combined grant we propose 3 modified Aims to test this general hypothesis: Aim 1--To analyze changes in the structure and functional implications of the pre and postnodal cephalic lymphatic architecture due to space flight-induced adaptations.(old Aim 1 of #14-14SF_Step2-0092); Aim 2--To evaluate space flight adaptations of the network structure of lymphatic vessels of the cribriform plexus and the GI tract. Increases in lymphangiogenesis are commonly associated with inflammation and lymph transport insufficiency. We will determine alterations in lymph vessel number, size, and distribution in these tissues. We will also determine if there are alterations in the formation of lymphatic valves, which are an important structural component of lymphatic vessels. (old Aim2 of #14-14SF_Step2-0092 combined with old Aim 1 of #14-14SF_Step2-0079); Aim 3--To analyze changes in lymph node structure that could alter the delivery of important immunological components to and from the nodes (cephalic for the head and neck tissue and mesenteric node for the GI tissue) leading to immune dysregulation and modulation of nodal lymph flow. We will also determine if there are shifts in the cell populations that reside in the lymph nodes, and around the prenodal lymph vessels. (old Aim 3 of #14-14SF_Step2-0092 combined with Aim 2 of #14-14SF_Step2-0079).",

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORT SUMMARY (April 2019--Compiled from investigator's 2017 final report)\nWe were not able to generate the type of histological data that we wished to obtain from this tissue; however, we were able to perform measures that do give us an insight into the fluid balance and tissue inflammatory state of the GI system in longer term rodent space flight. Our histological analysis showed that there was immune cell infiltration into the  flight  colons  to  a  greater  extent  than  in  ground  control  animals.  This  suggests  an inflammatory  reaction  occurring  within  the  tissue  in  flight.  Likewise, the  colon  structure (length  to  weight  ratio)  also  supports the  development  of  an  inflammatory  response resulting in edema. This is supported by both histological analysis and wet to dry weight ratio of the colon. There were similar gross signs of tissue changes in the ileum but to a lesser extent. There was also no way to compare the immune cell infiltration in the ileum to the colon due to even greater disruption of tissue structure than in the colon. Our observations on the types of immune cells invading the colon were hampered by the disruption the tissue handling caused to the tissue and antigens in the tissue. We observed many cells with large nuclei and small cytoplasmic volumes entering the tissue of space flown animals at plexi located in the submucosa and between the longitudinal and circumferential muscle layers. Due to the morphology of these cells we hypothesize that these cells are a mixture of monocyte derived cells and t-cells. There were few to no trilobed    or    barbell    shaped    nuclei that    would    be    indicative    of    neutrophil    or basophil/eosinophil infiltration. There were a number of granuloma like structures, which penetrated the submucosa into the mucosa and in extreme cases the lumen of the bowel in  both  flight  and  baseline  animals.  The  only  comparable  structures  that  we  found  in ground control animals appeared to be expansions of normal lymphoid tissue. The  changes  in  the  histidine  levels  in  the  stool  and  tissue  was  an  analysis  done  based  upon  a  hypothesis  that  the  changes  reported  in  the  microbiome  of  space flown  rodents  would  reduce  the  availability  of  this  critical  metabolite.  Histidine,  derived from  the  microbiome  is  converted  to  histamine  in  the  tissue  and  opposed  to  allergic reactions  in  other  tissues  actually  serves  to  regulate  immune  responses  in  the  gut. Additionally, histamine is critical to lymphatic vessel dilation which allows the vessels to have lower resistance to transporting fluid from the tissue. When we couple the gut cytokine profiles (predominantly lower cytokine patterns) together with the rest of the data that indicate some gut inflammation, this appears to be counterintuitive. However, the levels of cytokine (inflammatory or otherwise) in any tissue depend on the rates of delivery and generation of those cytokines to/in that tissue to the rate of removal of those cytokines (by degradation and lymph removal) from that tissue. When you couple the likely enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines in the gut with the lower levels found, one potential explanation is that lymph removal from the gut tissue is elevated during flight with the loss of the effects of gravity on lymph flow. Unfortunately, the histology of the head/neck tissues was of even less use in terms of  inflammatory  scoring, immunohistochemistry, and flow  cytometry.\nMeanwhile  the pattern of the effects of flight on the inflammatory cytokine profiles showed an elevation in their levels in the cribiform plate and cervical lymph node. That is just the opposite of what was seen in the gut cytokine levels during flight. Explanations to this include possible increased production or  delivery of  the  cytokines to  the  local  tissues  or  an  impaired removal from these tissue via lymph flow. This fits data we have previously seen in ground based models of microgravity in terms of impaired lymph flow generation predominantly in the head/neck region. Whether this is the explanation of these data remains to be seen with better measures of lymph flow and lymph flow generation during flight.\nIn summary, we  have  observed  signs  of  inflammation and  fluid  imbalance in  the tissue of space flown RR3 animals and from biochemical analysis there appears to be an imbalance of microbiome produced metabolites in the gut and changes in tissue cytokine profiles that are opposite in the head/neck versus the gut. These changes are likely linked and may feed into one another but to test this hypothesis requires more studies. First, we would need to confirm that there are changes in lymph transport in the gut and head/neck; second, we would have to test if other local measures of tissue inflammation match the cytokine changes we observed. Likewise, we need to test if the microbiome in and of itself can induce this inflammation/lymphatic disruption, and finally we would have to test if the restoration  of  either  the  microbiome  or  constituent  metabolic  products  resolves  these issues.\nANNUAL REPORT--RR3 progress report 2/28/2017\nThis project was originally delayed because of problems with flight and astronaut time availability, so we asked for the first no-cost extension (NCE) a little over a year ago since we had no access to flight tissues. Since then we began to start work on this project with access to tissues from flight animals (RR3) in September 2016 . Given the associated tissue storage approaches used for the RR3 flight animals, we had to implement changes to our analyses to accommodate the changes in tissue acquisition protocols associated with the new flight.  We replicated the freeze thaw process that was used on the tissue that we will receive access to and began to implement changes to our originally described protocols and/or developed new analyses to accomplishes most of the goals of our original approved studies.  We have participated in the meetings that lead to the Tissue Sharing opportunity in RR3 and completed the tissue acquisition at University of Colorado Boulder. We are currently finishing the use of these tissues and, as we thought, had to significantly modify and develop new analytical approaches.   \t  Our modified RR3 project called for analysis of lymphatic and associated tissues in 2 body regions: 1. the cervical lymphatics, cribriform plate tissues, meningeal tissues, and cervical lymph nodes (associated with potential changes in CSF pressure and visual acuity issues) ; 2. The colon small intestine, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph node (associated with potential changes in inflammatory status of the gut).\nThere were 4 general analytical approaches to these tissues: 1.Gross tissue measures (weight, length, size, etc.) ; 2.Classic histological evaluation of tissue inflammatory status (i.e., tissue inflammatory scores) ; 3. Immunofluorescent analyses of different markers indicating various cell and inflammatory indicators ; and 4. Various biochemical analyses of the tissues inflammatory status via Elisa and cytokine analyses.\nThe biggest concern we had was the potential damage cause by the freeze methods employed in the RR3 mission. This was a particular concern for the histology and immunofluorescence analysis.\nWe have completed a number of physical measurements that we have taken from the tissues that provide a insight into the status of the tissue. We have the weights of all the relevant bowel tissues (small bowel, large bowel, caecum, and mesenteric lymph node). We have also calculated the volume of the mesenteric lymph nodes of the animals, which has allowed us to determine the density of the nodes as well. We have calculated the percent water weights of the large bowel tissue to measure edema and we have also measured the distance between nuclei of the muscularis mucosa (only portion of the bowel wall with little to no damage) of the bowel wall as an objective histological method to determine tissue swelling.\nTo date, our assessment of histological structure and immunofluorescent antigen staining ability has been completed for colon and cervical lymph node tissues; we are about done with the small intestine and mesenteric lymph node histology. The original application for the GI tissues called for 3 general measures-- 1) vascular structure, 2) immune cell number and status, 3) physical and histological changes. Due to the damage of the tissue due to freezing and handling (any gross movements, bending, straightening, etc., of the gut after freezing leads to accumulating damage) before we were allowed to excise the samples that we received several of these measures were impossible to obtain. Histological structural integrity of the colon and small intestine has shown significant damage due to the freezing process to the intestinal epithelium and lamina propria regions (when comparing to similarly analyzed animals, minus the freezing process). These regions are critical for intestinal barrier function, but also are important for assessing the extent of both vascular structures and immunological state. So any assessment of any impact of space flight will be heavily skewed due to the tissue preservation. Thus we have lost the ability to score more than half of the GI histological based markers of tissue damage for an inflammatory score of the GI tissues. We will not be able to accurately provide full histological data as the epithelial and most of the crypt structures were damaged; additionally, we could not provide data on lipid absorption due to the same factors and rupturing of the fine subcellular structures of villi and the nascent chylomicrons. We note that the histological freeze damage is also similar in the cribiform plate tissues. This appears less true for the lymph node structures; however, there are notable signs of poor tissue preservation/freezer damage that also may bias/skew the results. We are continuing the histology of the mesenteric nodes to look for gross changes. This analysis should be done in a few weeks.\n15+ immunofluorescent markers for blood and lymphatic markers, vascular muscle markers, and immune cell markers have been characterized in RR3 tissues. Nearly all have succeeded in terms of positive staining; however, particular markers (such as LYVE1) did not work in the RR3 tissues, and some markers (mostly immune cell markers) showed peculiar morphology of cellular staining that may be tied due to the freezing process. The loss of the lymphatic specific marker LYVE1 is particularly problematic as it is the principle markers used in the cerebral tissue lymphatic structural analysis. We are continuing to attempt to use some antigen retrieval steps to rescue this important lymphatic marker; however, to date those have been successful. The implications of the markers that did not work or show unusual staining will be considered as part of the final assessment of flight tissues.\nDue to the same issues of damage and potential loss of antigenic epitope, the ability to provide accurate information on vascular structures in the bowel is questionable; however, we are examining other routes to provide some of this data currently (staining of the mesentery, etc.). Loss of immune cell antigenicity is also an issue and detection of these cells immunohistochemically may not be possible in some cases. We are utilizing different methods (differential histology staining, Western blot, nuclear counts, etc.) as alternate methods to provide relevant data.\nWe are just beginning to conduct the biochemical assays and we are hoping to rely on some extra biochemical markers of inflammation from these tissues to try to offset some of the problems the freezing method had on the tissue histology-based assays. We will be assessing if the freeze methods employed on RR3 affect these assays using control animals frozen optimally as compared to those similar to those that have been employed on RR3. After completing some preliminary tests we have just ordered the assay kits for the analysis of tissue extracts from the large and small bowel and fecal samples (cytokine and calprotectin, maybe albumin and possibly IgM in stool). These data will provide valuable information on inflammatory status of the bowel tissue and supplement the above mentioned measures that we already have.\nIn summary we still have another 4+ months of analysis to complete on the RR3 tissue samples, which is the rationale for the grant’s second no cost extension.",

The effects of the spaceflight environment on viral and microbial pathogen dynamics are largely unknown and represent both a significant gap in our knowledge and an important opportunity to study the presence of microbial populations and predict health risks during long-term space exploration.\nThe hypothesis of the ISS-MOP project is that certain short-living viruses associated with inert environmental spaces in the closed habitat of the ISS can have an adverse influence on crew health. To test this hypothesis the team will catalog viruses associated with surfaces and air of the ISS modules using the all-encompassing Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array (LLMDA), which contains probes to detect not only viruses but also clinically important human bacterial and fungal pathogens. In addition, skin and saliva samples from crewmembers will be requested to test the hypothesis.\nThere are three aims proposed in this ISS-MOP project. While the cultivation-based assay (Aim 1) provides a valid estimation of microbial presence, it offers only a limited assessment of the phylogenetic/pathogenic diversity and physiological breadth of the microbial population present. Therefore, the team will use the novel and comprehensive LLMDA microarray, which is specifically designed to elucidate the pathogenic viral and microbial diversity profiles of complex samples to at least the species level (Aim 2). In addition, we will characterize the virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms associated with these pathogens from the ISS by developing a new Virulence and Antibiotic Resistance gene array and analyze the samples on this array. The final deliverable of the proposed project to NASA will be the ISS-MOP dataset, a compilation of all of the genomic sequences and genetic information of viruses and microbes encountered on and within the ISS habitat (Aim 3).\nThe objectives of the ISS-MOP project directly respond to the National Research Council Committee for the Decadal Survey on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space recommendation P1 where it states, “to establish a microbial observatory program on the ISS to conduct long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics.” The ISS-MOP project will also provide answers to NASA Space Biology Guiding Questions: How do alterations in gravity affect in microbial cells (CMM1); Does the enhanced virulence or other genetic changes observed with microbial cultures flown in space occur in other species (CMM4); and What are the genetic changes underlying physiological responses to spaceflight demonstrated in biological systems (CMM5).",

            "task_progress": "The International Space Station (ISS) is a uniquely enclosed environment that has been continuously occupied for the last two decades. Throughout its operation, protecting the health of the astronauts on board has been a high priority. The human microbiome plays a significant role in maintaining human health, and disruptions in the microbiome have been linked to various diseases. To evaluate the effects of spaceflight on the human microbiome, body swabs and saliva samples were collected from four ISS astronauts on consecutive expeditions. Astronaut samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and microarrays to characterize the microbial biodiversity before, during, and after the astronauts’ time on board the ISS. Samples were evaluated at an individual and population level to identify changes in microbial diversity and abundance. No significant changes in the number or relative abundance of taxa were observed between collection time points when samples from all four astronauts were analyzed together. When the astronauts’ saliva samples were analyzed individually, the saliva samples of some astronauts showed significant changes in the relative abundance of taxa during and after spaceflight. The relative abundance of Prevotella in saliva samples increased during two astronauts’ time on board the ISS, while the relative abundance of other commensal taxa, such as Neisseria, Rothia and Haemophilus, decreased. The abundance of some antimicrobial resistance genes within the saliva samples also showed significant changes. Most notably, elfamycin resistance gene significantly increased in all four astronauts post-flight and a CfxA6 beta-lactam marker significantly increased during spaceflight but returned to normal levels post-flight. The combination of both shotgun metagenomic sequencing and microarrays showed the benefit of both technologies in monitoring microbes on board the ISS. There were some changes in each astronaut’s microbiome during spaceflight, but these changes were not universal for all four astronauts. Two antimicrobial resistance gene markers did show a significant change in abundance in the saliva samples of all four astronauts across their collection times. These results provide insight for future ISS microbial monitoring studies and targets for antimicrobial resistance screenings.\nThe microorganisms present on ISS surfaces originate from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights, over another year and a half.  Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA, extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide to detect intact/viable cells, or left untreated, to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells. Treated and untreated DNA were analyzed; metagenomics analysis was also conducted on the DNA samples. Culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses were also performed to supplement the metagenomics results. The overall number of microbial species detected at each time point did not significantly change, but species profiles did. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant changes in the microbial populations between sampling time points but not across surface locations. The observed antimicrobial resistance gene profiles for the ISS surface samples were more stable over time, both temporally and spatially, with 29 antimicrobial resistance genes detected across all samples.  Metagenomic assembled genomes were able to be reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 metagenomic assembled genomes, which provided further insight into the functional capabilities of the microbiome of this unique built environment. The populations of bacteria and fungi collected from the eight ISS surfaces remained similar between locations but changed over the course of a year and a half. The microbial communities were dominated by organisms associated with the human skin, indicating a large exchange between the astronaut crewmembers and the ISS surfaces. Despite the changes in the microbial community, the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes was stable, indicating the persistence of genetic redundancy.",

Simply put, the costs of maintaining a pressure vessel at one atmosphere have been traded away throughout the history of spaceflight vehicle design and are traded away in future designs, yet the biological impacts of lower atmospheric pressure, especially on plants, is both profound and poorly understood. The objective of this proposal is to develop a refined understanding of the metabolic processes involved in plant responses and physiological adaptations to low pressure environments relevant to space exploration. The long-term goal of this line of research is a fundamental understanding of low pressure plant biology within exploration vehicles and structures, with a practical goal of producing plants that are specifically designed to thrive in low atmospheric pressures. The essential drivers of this project are the inescapable engineering limitations to producing orbital, lunar, or Martian plant growth facilities that contain Earth-normal atmospheric pressures, and the knowledge that plants do mount complex, and sometimes unexpected costly metabolic responses to hypobaria. These responses can also be used as a model that will allow fundamental understanding of how plants adapt to changing terrestrial environments. In the initial phases of the project, we will use the tools of functional genomics in Arabidopsis plants to examine molecular genetic responses that occur during initial and chronic exposure to atmospheres ranging from Earth normal to near Martian pressures and containing various gas mixtures, especially those atmospheres that are in future vehicle designs. We will build on our previous molecular work using Arabidopsis (Paul et al., 2004). We will conduct extensive tests of a range of appropriate pressures and compositions using wild type genotypes. Then we will use select mutants and engineered changes in metabolic pathways implicated by the initial gene expression array data to test hypotheses regarding the fundamental mechanisms associated with the hypobaria response. Finally, we proposed a novel use of International Space Station (ISS) airlock facilities to investigate low pressure processes directly in a spaceflight microgravity environment, to take a first look at the emergent effects of altering atmospheric pressure within an operational vehicle in space; however, this last aspect of the proposal was not funded.\nThe overall goal of our program is to understand fundamental molecular biological responses to extraterrestrial and spaceflight environments. The current proposal for ground-based research leading to spaceflight addresses specifically a focus area defined by the Decadal Study: Plant and Microbial Growth Under Altered Atmospheric Pressures. The proposed research will provide fundamental insights into the biological impact of novel atmospheric environments, a focus area that is specifically identified in the Decadal Study (Decadal-Survey-Committee 2011).\nReference:\nPaul  AL,  Schuerger  AC,  Popp  MP,  Richards  JT,  Manak  MS,  and  Ferl  RJ.

            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Experiments in extreme and novel environments, like our spaceflight program and these in low pressure habitats, tell us that that life utilizes special, potentially unique signals to adapt to living with unique challenges. This insight has tremendous implications for the expansion of human existence, beyond, to other worlds, but also richly informs us about the potential for plants to adapt to environmental changes here on Earth. Any insights we reveal have applications to understanding how plants may better cope with some of the stresses we see in our daily environment like drought, global warming, flooding, high CO2, etc.  No plant on Earth has ever evolved to respond to ultra-low atmospheric pressures, yet with a little help, plants do just fine in this environment. We are learning what physiological tools plants use to cope with novel stresses, and that teaches us two things. First, it helps us understand what kind of help plants need to be productive on a long spaceflight mission or in a greenhouse on Mars--not an immediate need, but information we need before we do either of those things.  Second, how a plant responds to a novel stress gives us a fundamental understanding of how plants cope with an adverse environment. This knowledge can help us predict how plants of the Earth will manage changes in climates that we have not yet seen on a global scale, or how plants might respond to new pollutants.\nThis research is also about understanding how to optimize protected habitats and closed environments, issues that are important to us if we want to grow plants on a space station or long journey, but also if we want to grow plants in a greenhouse on another planetary surface. The lessons we have learned and the tools we have developed growing plants in low pressure chambers, as well as a Martian-analog greenhouse in the Arctic, have direct application to protected agriculture in Florida, and anywhere on Earth."

            "task_progress": "The summaries of a variety of experiments that comprised this body of work are provided below.\nI. Overview of Plant Transcriptome Response to Different Levels of Low Pressure.\nTwo experiments were used to establish an overview of molecular responses through the use of Affymetrix ATH1 arrays for roots and for shoots. Unless noted otherwise, in all cases gene expression showing at least 2-fold change in abundance and p < 0.01 were defined as differentially expressed genes:\nExperiment 1 – Variations on a Pressure. A set of 10 days old plants grown vertically on plates were transferred to the LPGCs and exposed to six different atmospheric pressures for a period of 24 hours; 97 kPa, 75 kPa, 50 kPa, 25 kPa, 10 kPa, and 5 kPa.   In all treatments the carbon dioxide was kept consistent at a partial pressure of 0.05 kPa. In each treatment, oxygen was kept at 21% of the total chamber pressure with Nitrogen as a balance of remaining gas. Each treatment of atmospheric pressures and gases was replicated with three separate, concurrently run LPGC. Each chamber in the LPGCs contained 10 plates, with approximately 12 plants on each plate.\nA total of 3156 genes were differentially expressed by at least 2-fold in at least one hypobaric treatment, and yet not a single gene was co-ordinately expressed among all of the treatments in leaves, and only three genes showed coordinate expression in roots. For treatments at pressures between 75 kPa and 10 kPa the transcriptomes showed dramatic tissue-specific patterns; roots shared few differentially expressed genes in common with shoots in response to hypobaria. In addition, roots appeared more sensitive to these environmental changes, as far more genes were significantly changed in roots than in shoots. Most of the genes that are repressed in hypobaric environments are associated with growth and metabolism. In shoots, many of the differentially expressed genes at 50 kPa are associated with transport functions and pathogen response  rather than hypoxia.  Below 50 kPa, the induction of genes associated with desiccation and water deprivation responsive pathways predominated.\nExperiment 2 – A 10 kPa Time Course. A set of 10 day old plants grown vertically on plates were exposed to 10 kPa and 97 kPa in LPGC and sampled at six different time points.  The 97 kPa atmosphere was composed of a partial pressures of 21 kPa oxygen, 0.05 kPa carbon dioxide, and a balance of nitrogen. The 10 kPa samples were composed of a partial pressure of 2.1 kPa oxygen, 0.05 kPa carbon dioxide, and a balance of nitrogen.  The samples were harvested at: 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours.  Each treatment of atmospheric pressures and times were replicated with three separate, concurrently run LPGC.  Each chamber in the LPGCs contained 10 plates of approximately 12 plants each.\nThere were a total of 2801 genes that were differentially expressed in at least one time point over the course of the 3 day experiment. Only 200 of those genes (7%) were coordinately expressed with similar trends in both roots and shoots. The consistently up-regulated genes included typical hypoxia responsive genes  as wells as drought and cold marker genes.\nRoots respond more quickly than shoots, as demonstrated by the large number of induced genes at 1 h. In contrast, the intensity of the response appears to generally mount over time in shoots, particularly with respect to down-regulated genes. The early response in roots could be promoted by the hypoxic component of hypobaria; the plant low-oxygen response consists of approximately two stages in a previous time course study, 0 to 0.5 h and 2 to 20 h. Shoots exhibited fewer differentially expressed genes in the early time points than roots. Compared to roots, shoots also have fewer examples of genes which display a mounting degree of expression over time. Nonetheless, there were many genes associated with biosynthetic and metabolic process that were induced or repressed early, and maintained or exceeded those levels of expression over time.\nCONCLUSIONS for Overview of Plant Transcriptome Response to Different Levels of Low Pressure.\nThe unique differential gene expression patterns in response to hypobaria suggest that the physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis to reduced atmospheric pressure is more complex than the acclimation to the reduced partial pressures of oxygen inherent to low atmospheric pressures.  Arabidopsis plants respond to hypobaria with a variety of changes in gene expression patterns that are organ specific, change with respect to the severity of the hypobaric environment, and adjust over time. The hypobaric response appears to overlay the perception of desiccation and biotic challenge on top of the perceptions of hypoxic stress, which suggests that the practical compensation for hypobaric stress in plants cannot be as simple as increasing the oxygen content, as is done for humans in the low pressure environments of space vehicles and space suits, or on the top of Mt. Everest.\nThese studies provide a window into the nature of the strategies used for physiological adaptation to hypobaria as an example of novel environments, and can allow dissection of specific components of plant responses to hypobaria as part of space exploration mission habitat design. For example, in a well hydrated, yet hypobaric greenhouse on Mars, plants would not need to expend the metabolic energy to maintain the drought response the hypobaria would elicit. Thus, there could be an advantage to engineer the plants along with the habitats envisioned for planetary exploration. The more fundamental application of this physical phenomenon is that plant metabolic responses to drought stress and stomatal regulation can be examined without subjecting the plant to comprehensive desiccation.\nIn addition, these transcriptome analyses may reveal genes that have contributed to the natural adaptation of plants to high altitude environments. It has been argued that plants that have evolved to live in a “stressful” environment are not actually “stressed” at all, rather, this is the habitat that is normal to them, and so the metabolic processes employed are just as benign as those engaged by their cousins living in seemingly more hospitable climates. Indeed, many of the differentially expressed genes at 75 kPa reflect gene expression patterns that are also differentially regulated in high altitude species and ecotypes when compared to representatives indigenous to lower altitudes.\nAs a unique stress, hypobaria presents an opportunity to understand the development of plant responses to novel environmental stress. We conclude that some aspects of the overall response to hypobaria are appropriate, in that hypoxia responses to the low oxygen of hypobaria make sense. However we also conclude that some elements of the response are inappropriate, in that the drought responses that are seen in hypobaria are inconsistent with a wet and humid environment. These seemingly inappropriate responses may help illuminate drought perception mechanism in plants, and further suggest strategies for improving growth in hypobaria especially as pressure is considered in extraterrestrial habitats and vehicles.\nII.  Dissection of Hypobaric Response: Hypoxia and Hypobaria with Normoxia\nControlled hypobaria presents biology with an environment that is never encountered in terrestrial ecology, yet the apparent components of hypobaria are stresses typical of terrestrial ecosystems. High altitude, for example, presents terrestrial hypobaria always with hypoxia as a component stress, since the relative partial pressure of O2 is constant in the atmosphere. Laboratory-controlled hypobaria, however, allows the dissection of pressure effects away from the effects typically associated with altitude, in particular hypoxia, as the partial pressure of O2 can be varied. In this study, whole transcriptomes of plants grown in ambient (97 kPa/pO2=21 kPa) atmospheric conditions were compared to those of plants transferred to five different atmospheres of varying pressure and oxygen composition for 24 hours: 50 kPa/pO2=10 kPa, 25 kPa/pO2=5 kPa, 50 kPa/pO2=21 kPa, 25 kPa/pO2=21 kPa, or 97 kPa/pO2=5 kPa. The plants exposed to these environments were 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown vertically on hydrated nutrient plates. In addition, 5 day old plants were also exposed for 24 hrs to the 50 kPa and ambient environments to evaluate age-dependent responses. The gene expression profiles from roots and shoots showed that the hypobaric response was more complex than simple hypoxia, and that adding back oxygen to normoxic conditions did not completely alleviate hypobaric responses.\nPlant phenotypes in low atmospheric pressure environment--  There was no evidence of desiccation-associated phenotype such as leaf wilting observed in either the 10 day old (10 d) or 5 day old (5 d) seedlings across the hypobaric and hypoxic treatments.The high relative humidity and continuous  water supply provided by the micro-climate of the Petri plate growing system likely removes any outward expression of actual dehydration. The solid nutrient media in the petri plant growing system is sufficient to grow Arabidopsis for 24 hours in severe hypobaria without exhausting the water supply within the media. Although water is moving more rapidly through the stomata, this phenomenon does not cause a visible (e.g., wilted) phenotype.\nThe impact of supplemental oxygen on transcriptional responses to 50kPa atmospheres.   Two treatments were used to evaluate the contribution of hypoxia to the hypobaric transcriptome of Arabidopsis:  exposing seedlings to 50 kPa, and to 50 kPa supplemented with oxygen to a normal (21 kPa) level (50 kPa/NormOx). Genes with significant (p < 0.01) differential expression by at least 2-fold based on 97 kPa control were defined as differentially expressed genes. There were 151 differentially expressed genes identified in at least one of these two conditions in roots or shoots, which were defined as 50 kPa atmosphere associated genes of 10d plants. Most of these genes exhibited different expression patterns in roots and shoots, demonstrating the tissue-specific response to hypobaria. Among them, 112 genes in 50 kPa and 25 genes in 50 kPa/NormOx were significantly changed in roots, while 23 genes in 50 kPa and 2 genes in 50 kPa/NormOx were in shoots\nThe impact of developmental age on the transcriptional response to 50 kPa atmospheres--  The developmental age of Arabidopsis had a substantial effect on the profile of differentially expressed genes in response to the 50 kPa and 50kPa/NormOx atmospheres. The root transcriptomes of 5 d Arabidopsis seedlings revealed exhibited notably different expression patterns than the transcriptomes of the 10 d roots in the same environments. There were 221 differentially expressed genes in at least one of these two conditions in roots of 5 d or 10 d plants, which were subsequently defined as 50 kPa atmosphere associated genes of 5 d/10 d roots. Among them, 103 genes of 5 d roots and 129 genes of 10 d roots were identified. Only 10 genes were co-ordinately expressed in 5 d and 10 d roots in 50 kPa, and just a single gene in the 50kPa/NormOx treatments.\nComparison of transcriptional responses to hypobaria and hypoxia with respect to 25 kPa atmospheres--   The more severe hypobaric environment of 25 kPa was used to further dissect the contribution of oxygen in the transcriptional response of 10 d Arabidopsis to reduced atmospheric pressure. The partial pressure of oxygen at 25 kPa is 5 kPa, an oxygen concentration which is known to confer a strong hypoxic stress response in plants. To better dissect hypobaric stress in 25 kPa, two additional conditions were utilized: total gas pressure in 25 kPa with a partial pressure of supplemental oxygen in 21 kPa (defined as 25kPa/NormOx) and hypoxia containing total gas pressure in 97 kPa with a partial pressure of oxygen in 5 kPa (defined as 97kPa/HypOx). Array analysis showed that there were 372 differentially expressed genes in at least one condition of 25 kPa, 25kPa/NormOx or 97kPa/HypOx in roots or shoots, which were therefore defined as 25 kPa atmosphere associated genes of 10 d plants.\nSimilar to 50 kPa and 50kPa/NormOx, difference of transcription pattern between responses to 25 kPa and 25kPa/NormOx as well as 25 kPa and 97kPa/HypOx must be clarified through direct comparison. Among 372 of 25 kPa atmosphere associated genes identified in as differentially expressed genes in response to 25 kPa, 25kPa/NormOx and 97kPa/HypOx in roots and shoots of 10 d plants, there were 271 genes in roots and 56 genes in shoots significantly changed in at least one of 25 kPa and 25kPa/NormOx, and 298 genes in roots and 74 genes in shoots significantly changed in at least one of 25 kPa or 97kPa/HypOx. In total, 93 genes between 25 kPa and 25kPa/NormOx and 5 genes between 25 kPa and 97kPa/HypOx showed more than 1.8-fold in expression change in roots, and 44 genes between 25 kPa and 25kPa/NormOx and 11 genes between 25 kPa and 97kPa/HypOx detected with same criteria in shoots. These genes represented the differential response to “hypobaria together with hypoxia” (25 kPa) and “hypobaria without normoxia” (25kPa/NormOx) or “hypoxia” (97kPa/HypOx). For severe low atmospheric pressure level (25 kPa) in which hypoxic stress was strong, the difference between responses to 25 kPa and 97kPa/HypOx were quite small in both roots and shoots. Majority of genes differentially expressed between responses to 25 kPa and 25kPa/NormOx did not show difference between responses to 25 kPa and 97kPa/HypOx. However, most of genes differentially expressed between 25 kPa and 97kPa/HypOx were also significantly changed between 25 kPa and 25kPa/NormOx, suggesting that a large portion of hypobaric responses were prompted by hypoxia, not total gas pressure, in this oxygen level.\nAdjustment of oxygen in space missions--  Being able to mitigate the effects of atmospheres modified from “Earth normal” is central to the exploration mission to take biology off planet, but understanding how plants dissect components of their environment to physiologically adapt to a stress is crucial to all plant cultivation scenarios. In the dissection of the hypobaria and hypoxic responses, the organ-specific and age-dependent transcription patterns suggest plants use adaptive strategies tied to the unique needs of a specific tissue, and that those needs change as the plant develops. Notably, the continuous light that matched the hardware in International Space Station (ISS) was used in our experimental process including plant germination, growth, and all treatments. It was reported that light signal could affect hypoxic response especially in tissue-dependent gene induction. Low oxygen promotes accumulation of diverse metabolites in roots and shoots as well as in plants treated with different levels (5-10 kPa or ~ 0 kPa) or types (submergence, flooding or argon-gassed) of hypoxia. Consistent with previous study of hypoxia response, 97kPa/HypOx (97 kPa/pO2=5 kPa) highly induced ethanol metabolic genes including ADH1 (AT1G77120) and PDC2 (AT5G54960) as well as alanine associated gene ALAAT1 (AT1G17290) in roots but not shoots. However, in a recent study most of the previously defined core hypoxia genes (Mustroph et al., 2009) were induced in an organ-independent manner by flooding when plants were submerged in early stage of photoperiod, while in our present data 34 out of 51 core genes were associated with 25 kPa atmosphere and only 9 genes showed similar induction by 97kPa/HypOx in roots and shoots. These suggest that the growth condition with constant light started from germination might alter organ-specific regulation of hypoxia genes compared with other photoperiod conditions. Considering the facility limitation in spaceflight mission, it will be necessary to conduct respective studies on plant responses to oxygen changes in allusion to different light conditions of growth.       The oxygen supplement assays provided novel insight into plant transcriptomic response in the condition of low atmospheric pressure with adjusted partial pressures of O2, such as has been utilized in manned space missions in the past, and may be employed in the future. When oxygen is supplemented to both moderate and severe hypobaric conditions it minimizes transcriptional responses caused by low atmospheric pressure, with the implication that the overall stress load on the plant is reduced. In comparison between hypobaria without hypoxia in 50 kPa and 25 kPa, 40 genes in roots and 3 genes in shoots were significantly changed in at least one of 50kPa/NormOx and 25kPa/NormOx conditions. The normoxic conditions with different total gas pressure resulted in similar transcription trends in these genes from both roots and shoots, which supported the conclusion from comparisons of 50 kPa vs 50kPa/NormOx and 25 kPa vs 25kPa/NormOx that plants were not so sensitive to hypobaria with nomoxia compared with hypobaria with hypoxia. However, while increasing oxygen concentrations in hypobaric environments mediates stress in plants, the data presented here suggest that exposing plants to at least mild hypobaric conditions can also serve to mediate plant stress in low oxygen environments. Interestingly, although the importance of oxygen in human hypobaric stress, such as the high-altitude pulmonary edema common to extreme mountain climbers, has long been appreciated, it is becoming increasingly clear that the combination of stresses associated with hypobaric environments elicits complex physiological responses, and requires complex mediation. The establishment of protected agriculture in extreme environments -- whether in on the surface of Mars, in exploration vehicles, or for terrestrial applications – will require careful management of in situ resources and engineering considerations to optimize the internal environment for plant health and productivity.  For instance, higher gas pressure differentials between inside and outside of greenhouse structures significantly increases the leak rate and therefore any reduction of internal pressure will bring engineering benefits.  Further, the ability to lower specific components of the gas mixture to grow plants would bring a benefit of reduced transportation of gases and increased payload. However, regardless of the engineering benefits, it is imperative that the biological consequences of hypobaric environments be well understood before adopting this strategy for exploration life support habitats.\nConclusion\nThe data presented here show that plant physiological adaptation to hypobaria is certainly more involved than a simple response to hypoxia. Based on the patterns of gene expression in hypobaria with supplemental oxygen, the most influential feature of hypobaria beyond hypoxia is a water stress apparently associated with the overall reduction of gas pressure, which manifests as mimicked aspects of drought stress. However, gene expression patterns also suggest that a plant’s response to hypobaria is more complex than simply a combination of hypoxia and drought stress. The gene expression patterns of plants in a normoxic low pressure environment suggest that plants are engaging genes associated with a complex stimulus that induces a novel metabolic pattern involving multiple unknown signaling components that is distinct from effects derived from exposure to either hypoxia or drought. Further, these data revealed that the molecular responses are organ specific in that roots and shoots each possess distinct metabolic strategies for adjusting to hypobaria. Taken together these data suggest that while the stress response to the novel environment of hypobaria can be largely understood as an appropriate response to the component stresses of hypoxia and water loss, those two components do not fully explain responses to hypobaria.\nThe data presented here are still under analysis, and ongoing work for publication will continue.\nReference\nMustroph A, Zanetti ME, Jang CJ, Holtan HE, Repetti PP, Galbraith DW, Girke T, Bailey-Serres J.

            "task_description": "Single-celled spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii respond within seconds to both the direction and magnitude of gravity stimuli by altering the direction and magnitude of a trans-cell Ca2+ current that is required for the gravity response. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which gravity alters the trans-cell current, and identify key signaling steps that link the current to cellular polarity changes directed by gravity. This focus on gravity signaling addresses an overarching question in the Space Biology Science Plan. Ca2+-uptake channels and Ca2+-ATPase efflux pumps drive the Ca2+ current across spore cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of genes and proteins highly expressed in spores at the peak of the Ca2+ current have identified likely candidates for the pumps and channels. Immunological approaches and yeast-based activity assays will be used to determine whether these transporters are localized on the plasma membrane and are regulated post-translationally. Recent evidence indicates that extracellular eATP [eATP], a newly discovered signaling agent, helps control the gravity response in Ceratopteris, just as it helps regulate gravitropism in Arabidopsis roots. Because eATP controls the activity of Ca2+ channels in plants, we will test the regulatory link between eATP and the activity of Ca2+ channels that is crucial for the gravity response in Ceratopteris. Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulins, annexins, and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases are highly expressed in Ceratopteris at the peak of the Ca2+ current. They are the most likely signal transducers that help mediate the downstream cell polarization events guided by gravity, and their regulatory role in the gravity response will be tested. Expected results will generate hypotheses that predict molecular responses likely to occur in Ceratopteris cells in response to the micro-g environment, and the proposal will describe International Space Station (ISS) experiments that could test these predictions.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The germinating spore of Ceratopteris is an especially valuable model system for studying the cellular bases of gravity-induced graviresponses on Earth, because both the sensing of gravity and the response occur in the same cell. The cellular level mechanisms of sensory responses are very similar in plant and animal cells, thus the bottom-to-top Ca2+ current that develops early during spore germination as one of the first polarized events induced by gravity in the cell may be an early event also in animal cells known to respond to gravity, such as muscle and bone cells. Our investigation into candidate molecules likely to be associated with both the efflux and influx phases of this current will help clarify how this current is controlled. A number of studies have documented the importance of Ca2+ currents for polarized growth in both animal and plant cells; however, there are few prior studies that have identified and analyzed the molecular components of these currents. Moreover, while it is generally accepted that Ca2+ is a second messenger that participates in a myriad of plant and animal sensory responses, there is still little known about the molecular identity of the Ca2+ channels that mediate many of these responses, especially responses to gravitational stimuli. The proposed tests of Ca2+ pump and channel function and regulation, including possibly channel regulation by eATP, will not only provide novel insights into how the gravity-directed Ca2+ current originates, but also further advance an understanding of channel structures. The results will set the stage for future assays of post-translational changes that occur during space flight in the Ca2+-ATPase pumps and/or mechanosensitive channels in fern and possibly also in some animal cells when the transporter activities go from near zero in micro-gravity to quite high as the g-force rises to 2-g or higher levels achieved during parabolic flight or on a centrifuge on the International Space Station (ISS)."

            "task_progress": "The specific aim of the novel research proposed was to discover the molecular bases of rapid gravity responses in single spore cells of the fern Ceratopteris richardii. The approach to achieve this goal was to identify from recently obtained transcriptomic data molecular components that would be likely to drive the calcium current that is rapidly modulated by gravity. This would then allow an assessment of  post-transcriptional signaling changes in these components that are both induced by gravity and needed for subsequent, gravity-directed polarity changes in cell division and growth. Prior literature suggests many of the post-transcriptional changes induced by gravity in single Ceratopteris cells are similarly induced in multi-cellular organs of flowering plants, so the findings of this project are likely to have relevance to gravitational studies in the more complex tissues of higher plants. Expected findings from the proposed studies would predict rapid molecular-level changes that will be induced in the micro-g environment, and testing the validity of these predictions in Space Flight experiments will be both feasible and likely to provide valuable new insights on the systems life uses to sense and react to gravity.\nOne of the goals of Aim 1 of the original proposal was to molecularly identify cation transporters that could play a major role in driving the trans-cell calcium current that is directed by gravity in fern spores cells. In accord with this goal, we obtained the full-length sequence of a putative MscS (mechanosensitive channel, small current) gene, and obtained evidence in support of the conclusion that it actually has Msc activity by showing that it could partially rescue a bacterial knockout of Msc.  We also obtained partial sequences of two other Msc candidates in Ceratopteris that will serve as the basis to design primers that can “walk” through the Ceratopteris transcriptome and genome to obtain their full sequences, and the primary sequences of the proteins they encode. This will enable the production of antibodies that can be used to identify where each of the Msc channels is localized. If any of these candidates prove to be mechanosensitive channels on the plasma membrane, it (or they) would be the one(s) most likely to undergo post-translational modifications by gravity stimulation.\nThe goal of Aim 2 of the original proposal was to test the role of genes encoding Ca2+-binding proteins that are expressed at the peak of the trans-cell Ca2+ current by suppressing or overexpressing their transcription using transformation methods. We have successfully generated transgenic Ceratopteris spores expressing one of several different transgenes, and these spores will be valuable tools for genetically dissecting gravity responses in spores that respond to gravity while they are still single cells. The mutants include one expressing the calcium reporter Yellow Cameleon, which will enable assessing gravity-induced changes in [Ca2+]cyt; one constitutively expressing a spore annexin, which is a calcium-binding protein implicated in regulating calcium channels in plasma membranes, one suppressed in annexin expression; one knocked down in expression of the Ca2+ATPase pump that helps drive the gravity-induced trans-cell calcium current;  and one knocked down in one of the mechanosensitive ion channels described above in the paragraph on Aim 1. Generating these mutants and genetically confirming their mutant status required over two years of ground-breaking research, and the transgenic products are the first (and still the only) fern mutants modified in spore-expressed genes.\nWe made the most progress on Aim 3 of the original proposal, which was to test the role of eATP in promoting the critical Ca2+-uptake step of the spore gravity response. Key background information that provides the rationale for this goal is that when gravity directs the polarization of Ceratopteris fern spores this process begins with the uptake of calcium through channels at the bottom of the spore, and this step is necessary for the gravity response. Data from several different laboratories showing that extracellular ATP (eATP) regulates calcium channels in plants and animals led to the hypothesis that extracellular nucleotides could play a role in the gravity-directed polarization of Ceratopteris spores. In animal and plant cells ATP can be released from mechanosensitive channels.\nThe idea that a differential distribution of a signaling molecule could lead to morphological polarity is not unique. In this regard, gradients of the growth hormone auxin are among the best documented to be inductive of cell polarity in plants. The differential distribution of eATP during gravity-directed polarization could be an early step in a series of asymmetrical molecular events that ultimately lead to the downstream cellular and morphological changes needed to generate a gravity-directed, downward growing rhizoid in Ceratopteris spores. Precedent data relevant to this hypothesis are those of Tang et al. (Wenqiang Tang, Shari R. Brady, Yu Sun, Gloria K. Muday, and Stanley J. Roux.  Extracellular ATP Inhibits Root Gravitropism at Concentrations That Inhibit Polar Auxin Transport. Plant Physiol. 2003 131: 147-154.) in the journal Plant Physiology, who showed that a high [eATP] inhibits the gravity response in Arabidopsis roots. They interpreted their data as evidence that an eATP gradient could be one of the first steps involved in the gravity response in plant cells. These data led us to test whether gravity could induce a gradient of eATP between the top and bottom of germinating fern spores, and, if so, whether this gradient could help mediate the gravity effect of directing the polarization of the spores.\nIn order to carry out this test, an ATP biosensor, developed by the McLamore laboratory at the University of Florida, was used to measure the [eATP] at the bottom and top of germinating spores during gravity-directed polarization. This biosensor could quantify eATP levels down to the low nM range, and it has a tip diameter of only 1-2 µm, much smaller than the 100-120 µm diameter of spore cells. Using this unique tool with a micromanipulator that could guide the probe to within a few microns of the spore surface, we made the exciting discovery that the [eATP] along the bottom of the spore averaged 7-fold higher than the concentration at the top. Treatments that disrupted the gradient, such as flooding the medium with ATP, or that antagonized eATP receptors, such as adding the ATP receptor blocker PPADS to the medium, or that hydrolyzed ATP in the medium, such as by the addition of phosphatase enzymes, all resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the gravity response. In order to investigate the source of ATP release, spores were treated with Brefeldin A (BFA), which would block cellular secretory activity, and gadolinium trichloride (GdCl3), which would block the transport activity of the mechanosensitive channels that release ATP into the extracellular medium. These treatments resulted in a significant decrease in gravity-directed polarization.\nThe same eATP biosensor was also used to measure ATP release after treatment with both BFA and GdCl3. Both of these treatments caused a significant decrease in [ATP] measured around spores. These results supported the hypothesis that ATP could be released from mechanosensitive channels and secretory vesicles during gravity-directed polarization.\nThe novel findings described above show a clear role for eATP in gravity-directed polarization of Ceratopteris spores by documenting that gravity can induce a bottom-to-top gradient of extracellular ATP around the spores, and that this gradient promotes gravity-directed polarization of the spores. They provide support for the hypothesis that mechanosensitive channels, which have been implicated in other reports as critical components of gravity responses, can help generate eATP gradients that can enhance a cellular gravity response. Overall, they reveal that quantifying and evaluating gradients of eATP can lead to a more thorough understanding of how plants use ATP release to direct growth and development.\nProduction of the novel self-referencing biosensor used to document the gravity-induced eATP gradient between the top and bottom of vertically-oriented spore cells would not have been possible without support from this NASA grant. Recognizing that this biosensor would be a valuable research tool for investigating other eATP-regulated phenomena not only in ferns but also in higher plants, we used it to assay [eATP] levels around growth zones of primary roots of Arabidopsis, because previous research had indicated cells release ATP as they grow. We also used the probe to evaluate whether changing the expression of two apyrase (NTPDase) enzymes (AtAPY1 and AtAPY2), which had been implicated in hydrolyzing and thus limiting the [eATP], actually altered the [eATP]. Our results, which we presented in posters at two international meetings, showed that the [eATP] is highest in root zones that have the highest growth rate (i.e., elongation zones) and that the constitutive expression of AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 lowered this concentration, whereas suppression of these apyrases raised the [eATP]. These results provided novel and important verification of previously postulated hypotheses about the relationship of eATP and apyrase enzymes to growth, and they are being assembled into a manuscript that we expect to submit this summer.",

While, of course, the original essence remains, what is presented here is the summit of the first milestone, and precedes previous reports. This milestone is concerned with Earth studies to develop and rigorously test the technology for determining the sensitivity of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) during spaceflight, and to elucidate the genetic basis of whatever change is seen. The second milestone is experimentation during the spaceflight itself, which was launched in late 2017.\nA paper entitled: “Payload hardware and experimental protocol development to enable future testing of the effect of space microgravity on the resistance to gentamicin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and its (sigma)s-deficient mutant,” was published online in May 2017: Life Sciences in Space Research 15 (2017) 1–10 2214-5524/ © 2017 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Published by Elsevier Ltd.; [\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001\n] As has been pointed out before, this project represents highly collaborative and collegial collaboration between Stanford and NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The published paper reflects this not only by the joint authorship of it by both Stanford and Moffett Field scientists, but also the benefits that accrue from collaboration between biological expertise (Stanford) and the flight technological expertise (Moffett Field).\nThe list of authors is as follows: AC Matin, J-H Wang, Mimi Keyhan, Rachna Singh, and Michael Benoit of the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford School of Medicine; and Macarena P. Parra, Michael R. Padgen, Antonio J. Ricco, Matthew Chin, Charlie R. Friedericks, Tori N. Chinn, Aaron Cohen, Michael B. Henschke, Timothy V. Snyder, Matthew P. Lera, Shannon S. Ross, Christina M. Mayberry, Sungshin Choi, Diana T. Wu, Ming X. Tan, Travis D. Boone, Christopher C. Beasley, and Stevan M. Spremo, of NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA.   The abstract of this paper, reproduced here (in quotes), succinctly describes the evolved conceptual background, and demonstrates in detail the development of the EcAMSat platform, and its thorough testing using spaceflight-like commands.\n“Human immune response is compromised and bacteria can become more antibiotic resistant in space microgravity (MG). We report that under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), stationary-phase uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) become more resistant to gentamicin (Gm), and that this increase is dependent on the presence of s (a transcription regulator encoded by the rpoS gene). UPEC causes urinary tract infections (UTIs), reported to afflict astronauts; Gm is a standard treatment, so these findings could impact astronaut health. Because LSMMG findings can differ from MG, we report preparations to examine UPEC’s Gm sensitivity during spaceflight using the E. coli Anti-Microbial Satellite (EcAMSat) on a free-flying “nanosatellite” in low Earth orbit. Within EcAMSat’s payload, a 48-microwell fluidic card contains and supports study of bacterial cultures at constant temperature; optical absorbance changes in cell suspensions were made at three wavelengths for each microwell and a fluid-delivery system provided growth medium and predefined Gm concentrations. Performance characterization is reported here for spaceflight prototypes of this payload system. Using conventional microtiter plates, we show that Alamar Blue (AB) absorbance changes can assess the Gm effect on E. coli viability, permitting telemetric transfer of the spaceflight data to Earth. Laboratory results using payload prototypes are consistent with wellplate and flask findings of differential sensitivity of UPEC and its delta rpoS strain to Gm. if (sigma)s plays the same role in space MG as in LSMMG and Earth gravity, countermeasures discovered in recent Earth studies (aimed at weakening the UPEC antioxidant defense) to control UPEC infections would prove useful also in space flights. Further, EcAMSat results should clarify inconsistencies from previous space experiments on bacterial antibiotic sensitivity and other issues.” The manuscript may be consulted for further details and all the relevant references; see Bibliography section in 2017 report.\nIn addition, the work has brought to light issues, such as the stress exerted by the flight equipment on bacteria, which we are now in the process of elucidating and ameliorating for the development of better future platforms for spaceflight experimentation on bacterial biology, resistance, and virulence.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is becoming an extremely serious problem on Earth that impacts space travelers harder given the deleterious effect of microgravity on human immune response. The research has confirmed the hypothesis that underpinned it, and has shown the way to enhance effectiveness of antibiotics in general. Subsequent work, which is in progress, has identified compounds whose co-administration with antibiotics will enhance their curative power; these can also permit lowering the needed amount of antibiotics for treating infections, thereby minimizing their side effects. This promises to improve life in space as well as on Earth."

            "task_progress": "The spaceflight took place onboard a free-flying “nanosatellite,” which, for the first time utilized a 6-U configuration (a “U” being a 10-cm cube). The experiments were conducted on the EcAMSat hardware platform that we developed and described previously in the task book reports. Cell viability in this platform was measured by changes in the absorption of the dye Alamar Blue (AB); these were telemetered to Earth and recorded by daily communications with the spacecraft at Santa Clara University. Parallel ground controls were run. The flight performed very smoothly and all the needed data were successfully obtained. The major conclusion from the results is that the gene rpoS continues to play a critical role in making urinary pathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) highly resistant to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm). This antibiotic is used to treat urinary tract infections often reported in astronauts. Therefore, the potential small molecule inhibitors that we have identified (using bioinformatics approaches) of the protein encoded by rpoS and the antioxidant proteins it controls hold the promise to promote astronaut health in spaceflights. That these molecules are valuable also in meeting the rampant bacterial antibiotic resistance on Earth has been pointed out before.\nA second important finding is that the high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs) used to simulate microgravity on Earth did indeed provide correct information of UPEC biology in this respect because it is with the use of this system that we had first discovered the rpoS role in Gm resistance. The cumulative work on this grant earned the entire EcAMSat team individual NASA awards.\nThe publication  concerning this work will be submitted within the coming weeks.",

            "task_description": "A major challenge in mitigating infectious disease risks during spaceflight is to understand, model, and integrate the combined action of cellular, molecular, and biochemical networks in the host that potentiate transition to disease in response to infection by pathogens cultured in microgravity. This is a critical issue to address, as spaceflight negatively impacts crew immune function and alters microbial virulence, gene expression, and antimicrobial resistance, strongly suggesting an increased risk for in-flight infectious disease. Herein, we propose to apply our 3-D intestinal co-culture models as human surrogates to characterize their transcriptomic (via RNA-Seq), metabolomic (via mass spectrometry), and inflammatory responses to infection with spaceflight analogue and control-cultured Salmonella typhimurium. To facilitate a practical integration of these systems, the combined analysis proposed in this study will focus on the metabolomic subset associated with host oxidative stress, redox, and inflammatory responses. These factors are of key importance in the infection process and may contribute to reported abnormalities and dysfunction in the crews' immune system during flight. We will use systems modeling approaches based on both quantitative gene transcript and biochemical metabolite correlation and all of their known/inferable relationships between genes, proteins, pathways, and biochemistry that will allow us to form new bridges and a general framework for making these linkages between gene expression (RNA-Seq) and biochemical (metabolomic) data. This approach will allow for new insights into relationships between redox functions, oxidative stress, inflammation, and infection that either approach alone would not be able to achieve. By exploring interconnections between these systems over different kinetic timepoints before and after infection, this systematic approach will provide an unparalleled level of sensitivity and resolution of the dynamics of the host response to a microgravity-analogue cultured pathogen, which may lead to identification of novel infection mechanisms and strategies for prevention and control.",

Specifically, this study will utilize the microgravity spaceflight platform to 1) to broaden our knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction that leads to infectious disease, and 2) for the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat infectious disease for the general public."

            "task_description": "May 2015 Revision to Task Agreement (Ed. note: information received September 2015).\nDue to problems obtaining samples from Kibo-JEM (Japanese Experiment Module), the project has been modified with a new title, “Bacterial, Archaeal, & Fungal Diversity of the ISS--HEPA Filter System.” The revised scope will allow the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to undertake a 28-month flight study to examine the microorganisms associated with HEPA filters. The ISS-HEPA project will develop a comprehensive census of the microbial population on the HEPA filter collected from various locations of the International Space Station (ISS), using genetic biosignatures and computational modeling. This microbial census will provide NASA with the ability to accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to overall microbial profiles, the JPL team will determine which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health.\nOriginal Task Description: Space microbiology research working groups in Japan, authorized by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), submitted proposals in response to the JAXA Announcement of Opportunity, 2012. The JAXA proposal that is managed by Principal Investigator Prof. Masao Nasu, Osaka University, contained several subgroups, including subgroup 4, headed by Dr. Takashi Yamazaki, JAXA. This subgroup 4 will conduct an investigation on “Analysis of microbial dynamics in the space habitation system by using new molecular microbial ecological techniques and also monitoring microbial contamination from air and surfaces of the ‘Kibo’ Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo-JEM).” The JAXA proposal submitted by subgroup 4 identifies the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) team headed by Dr. Kasthuri Venkateswaran as a collaborator to jointly explore the investigation.\nThe Bacterial, Archaeal, and Fungal Diversity of Kibo-JEM Surfaces project (JPL-JAXA project) will undertake a three-year flight study to examine the changes in the microorganism population on the Kibo-JEM surfaces. The JPL-JAXA project proposes to develop a comprehensive census of the microbial population on the Kibo-JEM surfaces, using genetic biosignatures and computational modeling. This census will provide NASA and JAXA with the ability to accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to overall microbial profiles, the JPL-JAXA team will determine which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health. Specific JPL-JAXA project goals will enable us to resolve applicable Human Research Program (HRP) integrated research plan (IRP) risks: (1) determine if changes in Kibo-JEM microbiome are occurring during a spaceflight mission and if so, (2) determine whether any changes noted would create a greater health risk for the crew.\nThere are three aims proposed in this JPL-JAXA project and study of the Kibo-JEM microbiome. Through optimizations and comparative evaluations of methods designed to collect, process, analyze, and archive biomolecules sampled, the JPL-JAXA team will increase downstream sensitivity of laboratory assays as well as enhance the current understanding of the population dynamics of the Kibo-JEM module (Aim 1). The JPL-JAXA team will adapt molecular technologies currently in use with the National Institute of Health (NIH) – Human Microbiome Program (HMP) Roadmap—such as rRNA gene-variable region tag sequencing, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS), and DNA microarrays, as well as cloning and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)—to comprehensively elucidate the microbial diversity profiles associated with the Kibo-JEM surfaces (Aim 2). The final project deliverable to NASA will be the Kibo-JEM database, a compilation of all of the genomic sequences and genetic information of microbes encountered on and within the Kibo-JEM habitat (Aim 3). Computational modeling of the Kibo-JEM microbial population dynamics inferred from the database will then be carried out to predict the complete spectrum of organisms present.\nThe JPL-JAXA project will compare microbial diversity, microbial characteristics, and functional capabilities of the microorganisms associated with the Kibo-JEM. The resulting database will enable HRP to evaluate the effect of spaceflight radiation and microgravity on the Kibo-JEM microbiome. The JPL-JAXA project in combination with results from studies of crew susceptibility will be used to determine the risk of microbiologically induced adverse health effects during a spaceflight mission. This assessment will allow HRP to determine if current operational and engineering controls used to mitigate microbiological risks are adequate or whether additional countermeasures should be developed.",

The whole-genome sequences (WGS) of SBMCC were generated and made available to the public. In addition to multiple copies of same microbial species, the SBMCC consists of several newly identified microorganisms. The WGS of the characterized bacterial isolates include Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriales, Bacillaceae, Agrobacterium, Klebsiella, Methylobacterium, and Staphylococcus. Moreover, isolates of fungi have also been sequenced, belonging to the members of fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.\nThis SBMCC archival of the ISS and CRV will aid in the ongoing characterization of short sequence, shot-gun metagenome surveys of the microbial diversity present in these built environments. The availability of these new WGS will also enable genetic comparisons between microorganisms sampled from Earth-based environments with those sampled from spacecraft surfaces of the ISS and CRV. Such comparisons will help to elucidate genetic adaptations that allow some of these microorganisms to become more virulent and allow all of them to survive the harsh environment of space (e.g., ionizing radiation, microgravity, desiccation, and oxidative stress). Additionally, when annotated, functional analyses of these WGS can help to identify targeted strategies for the control of problematic microorganisms that may degrade metals and plastics, become potentially pathogenic and harm astronauts, or obstruct water supply due to their biofilm forming capabilities in the engineering systems of the closed habitat.",

A role of the vacuole in controlling gravity perception is well accepted, but the molecular mechanisms by which the vacuole interacts with amyloplasts or regulates their sedimentation during gravitropism are yet to be identified. We recently uncovered a novel vacuole phenotype in agravitropic mutant alleles of VTI11 in Arabidopsis. We predict that this vacuole phenotype of vti11 mutants has negative effects on the organization of actin cables or the cortical endoplasmic reticulum, and therefore prevents amyloplast sedimentation. In addition, we have uncovered a novel regulation of vacuolar membrane fusion by phosphoinositides. Based on our results, we developed the hypothesis that mechanisms of vacuole remodeling that are mediated by phosphoinositide signaling are critical for the perception or transduction of the gravitropic signal in plants. A unique assay for vacuole fusion that we developed will be used to determine the role of specific cellular components in membrane fusion and gravity perception. The specific aims of this research project are to: 1) Determine subcellular phenotypes that impair gravity perception in itt3/vti11. 2) Identify the role of phosphoinositides in gravitropism.  3) Determine the role of the Adaptor Protein (AP-3) complex on vacuole biogenesis and gravitropism.\nOverall, this research will improve our understanding of vacuole biogenesis, the interactions between the vacuole and other cellular components involved in gravity perception, and the role of phosphoinosidides in gravitropism.",

            "task_description": "The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e., primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g., mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on Earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA (NASA Research Announcement) because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research will provide a deeper understanding of how microgravity influences plant development. The focus of this research will be on the development of roots and how they modify the expression of their genes to adapt to the microgravity environment of spaceflight.\nThis research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of their cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature to overcome the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth."

Malfunction of the ABRS hardware on the ISS, de-manifestation from Space X-3, and delays in the launch of Space X-5 were set-backs we encountered during the first two years of the grant. However, we were able to overcome these early problems and completed most of the specific aims that we proposed. A major accomplishment of this proposal was the implementation of a simple method to delay germination of Arabidopsis seeds until experimental activation in space. We foresee that many in the plant space biology community will benefit from these methods. Another direct outcome of this grant is the discovery of novel plant proteins involved in modulating the cytoskeleton. These results have been published in high impact peer-reviewed publications.\nWe also successfully retrieved material from ground- and space-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. Processing and data analysis from these spaceflight experiments have been completed. We have deposited raw RNA-Seq data from our spaceflight work to the NASA GeneLab site but these have not yet been publicly released. During this funding period, we also completed glycomic studies of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in space and compared them with the corresponding ground controls. Both the transcriptomics (i.e., RNA-Seq) and glycomics results will be submitted this year for peer-review.\nTaken together, our RNA-Seq and glycomics results continue to point to the spaceflight environment as a major trigger for oxidative stress responses in plants. Our results suggest that the ideal plant ideotype for future space habitats could be similar to those that have been developed for marginal agricultural lands on Earth including crops tolerant to low oxygen (e.g., hypoxia) and other stressors (drought, insect resistance) as well as those with more robust cell wall mechanical properties. Such findings could be the bases of future spaceflight experiments wherein performance of plants with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress can be evaluated on hardware such as the advanced plant habitat (APH) or the Spectrum.",

            "task_description": "How plants respond to gravity is a fundamental biological question with important implications for spaceflight. Here we propose ground-based research designed to lead to spaceflight, in the area of plant biology. Our experimental approach focuses on several families of putative mechanoreceptors known as mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. MS ion channels have been proposed to play a role in the perception of gravity in plants for many years, a hypothesis that is supported by several lines of evidence, but one that has not yet been systematically tested by molecular genetics. The research plan utilizes contemporary methodologies for the study of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to interrogate the biological function of plant MS ion channels and builds upon previous NASA-funded research into the response of plants to altered gravity environments. We will determine the role played by MS ion channels in mediating gravity signal transduction, their putative roles in adaptation to microgravity, and the molecular mechanisms by which the model MS ion channel MSL10 activates stress-response pathways in plant cells. We expect that these activities will have the following outcomes: 1) Test the long-standing hypothesis that MS ion channels function in gravity perception; 2) Contribute to our basic knowledge regarding how plants exploit MS ion channels to sense and respond to mechanical stress; 3) Provide information that could be used on Earth to improve crop productivity; and 4) Establish a foundation of knowledge required to generate more mechanistic and sophisticated hypotheses about plant gravity perception that can be tested in spaceflight using the European Modular Cultivation System and/or the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Imaging system. (These proposed studies directly address the objectives of the solicitation, as they aim to answer basic questions about how plants respond to changes in gravity and should lead to hypotheses that can be tested on future spaceflights.)",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Identifying the molecular mechanisms by which MS ion channels function and evaluating their roles in the perception and response to altered gravity conditions will help fill a large gap in our knowledge regarding the molecules involved in gravity and mechanoperception. Gaining this knowledge has the potential to achieve two long-term goals: 1) to mitigate the effects of mechanical stress on crop plants on Earth, and 2) to counteract the effects of altered gravity environments on plants grown in space. These experiments will address the high priority goal of “understanding the basic mechanisms of plant response” to changes in gravity described in the Decadal survey of 2011."

            "task_progress": "Research Progress May 2016-July 2017\nAim 1: Test the Hypothesis that MS ion channels Play a Role in Root Gravitropism Using a Machine Vision and Computation Approach. Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels have been implicated in a variety of steps in gravity signaling, but are most often implicated in the initial gravity response. MS ion channels have been proposed to sense ER membrane tension as a result of the amyloplasts sedimentation; the plasma membrane tension resulting from the uneven pressure of the tonoplast at the bottom of the cell; or the action of amyloplasts on actin microfilaments tethered to the plasma membrane. There are at least three potential barriers to the identification of MS ion channels in forward genetic screens for genes involved in gravity response: 1) redundancy of MS ion channel gene function; 2) redundancy of gravity response pathways involving MS ion channels; and 3) subtle effects of MS ion channel function on the gravity response. We aim to test the long-held hypothesis that MS ion channels mediate the perception of changes in gravity vector using a reverse genetics approach and a highly sensitive Machine Vision and Computation assay for defects in gravity perception.\nProgress: We further characterized the gravity defect in the msl2 msl3 mutants. The msl2 msl3 double mutant lacks MS channels in the plastid envelope. While the msl2 msl3 mutant shows overall defects in orientation when grown vertically on solid media, or on a re-positioning machine, there are developmental defects that complication interpretation. Several aspects of cellular morphology that are key for gravity response disappear or appear disorganized in msl2 msl3 mutants compared to those in wild type seedlings. We tested a range of media with added osmotic support and saw that we could suppress these phenotypes to some degree, but in the end were unable to generate growth conditions where root growth was normal enough to feel confident that defects in gravity could be attributed to perception rather than to anatomical differences.\nWe worked towards generating msl9 msl10 pgm and msl4 msl5 msl6 pgm mutants.\nWe tested several AtPiezo CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockouts for gravity defects but did not observe any.\nAim 2: Test the Hypothesis that MSL and other MS ion channels are involved in the perception and/or Adaptation to Weightlessness.\nProgress: We do not have progress to report on this aim.\nAim 3: Determine the Molecular Mechanism of MSL10-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Signaling. MS ion channels are implicated in the perception and/or response to changes in gravity conditions. The experiments in this aim are designed to gain a more molecular and mechanistic handle on the regulation and signaling behavior of MS ion channels, building on our recent observations that overexpressing the MscS-Like MS ion channel MSL10 from A. thaliana leads to ROS-associated cell death. Understanding how MSL10 is regulated and how its activation leads to ROS-related stress signaling may be important for mitigating the effects of mechanical stress on crop plants or plants in the space environment.\nProgress:\nA. We established that endogenous expression of unphosphorylated MSL10 and a single point mutation the MSL10 C-terminus result in the hyper-accumulation of ROS. Furthermore, the chaperone complex SGT1/RAR1/HSP90 is required for this phenomenon.\nPrevious years we showed that overexpression of MSL10 leads to cell death signaling and the production of ROS at endogenous levels of expression. Now we can say that dephosphorylation-dependent cell death signaling does not require overexpression of MSL10, as we observe cell death, dwarfing, and the production of ROS in plants expressing phospho-dead MSL10, but not phospho-mimic MSL10 at endogenous levels. Furthermore, a single EMS-induced point mutation in the MSL10 C terminus, S640L, produces the same phenotypes.\nHSP90 and its co-chaperone SGT1 play a conserved role in plant and animal innate immunity by stabilizing pathogen sensors called NLR proteins. It was also recently reported that HSP90 and SGT1 stabilize a hormone receptor in response to heat stress, indicating that this chaperone complex plays a role in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. We found that HSP90, SGT1, and RAR1 are all required for MSL10-induced cell death in the transient tobacco expression assay, and for the hyper-accumulation of ROS, indicating that the same is true in stably transformed plants. However, we do not detect direct interactions between MSL10 and any of these components by a variety of methods.\nB. We determined that 14-3-3 proteins interact with MSL10 in a specific manner.   14-3-3 proteins are evolutionarily conserved proteins that often recognize and bind to the loose consensus sequences R/KXXS or R/KXXXS, subsequently regulating the function of their binding partners or “clients” via effects on enzyme activity, subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction, conformation, or stability. Four of the seven in vivo phosphorylated residues in the MSL10 N-terminus are part of a 14-3-3 consensus binding site. While full-length MSL10 interacts with all 14-3-3 proteins in the split-ubiquitin yeast two hybrid, the introduction of four point mutations designed to disrupt the 14-3-3 consensus sequences at S48, S57, S128, and S131 also disrupt the interaction. As is shown, MSL10K45A K53A K124A R127A interacts normally with the positive control in this assay.\nManuscripts in Preparation:\nD. Basu, K. M. Veley, J. Shoots, Matt Mixdorf and E. S. Haswell. MSL10 induces cell death through   SGT1/RAR1/HSP90 and 14-3-3 proteins in response to mechanical disturbance at plasma membrane.   Submission target: Spring 2018.",

            "task_description": "The detrimental effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system are well known.  It is believed that these effects may lead to clinically significant risks to astronauts on long duration space missions as well as to the success of these missions themselves.  Current studies are limited primarily to human studies and rodent experiments.  However, these model systems and human studies have significant limitations that may be addressed by using the well-established Drosophila model.  Drosophila have previously been successfully launched into space and a ground-based Drosophila model for cardiac disease and function has been developed. However, the genetically versatile Drosophila model has yet to be used for studying the effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system.\nWe flew 4 genotypes of Drosophila aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for approximately 30 days, along with identical 1-g ground controls.  The Drosophila required minimal astronaut intervention, primarily transfer to an incubator and stowage within the ISS.  The samples will be retrieved post-flight and analyzed using established methods.  Heart function, including measurements of diastolic and systolic intervals, heart rate, heart diameters, contractility, and arrhythmias was recorded.  Microscopic and immuno-histochemical evaluations of heart morphology was carried out.  Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by RNA Sequencing (RNA Seq) was conducted on both heart and brain tissue.\nThe ultimate goal of this research was to obtain data on heart muscle function in low gravity while validating the Drosophila model for studying the effects of spaceflight on cardiac disease and function. Our studies identified disruption in metabolic gene expression and a dramatic increase in proteasome gene expression. This was confirmed in a subsequent flight with immuno-histochemical analyses. The increased proteasome numbers correlated with an increase in amyloid-like protein aggregations within the heart tissue and with increased myofibrillar disarray. We also documented a decrease in collagen fibers associated with the sarcomere Z-lines within myocardial cells.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Information about cardiac muscle function in microgravity is expected to provide insights on genetic and molecular changes that occur with muscle atrophy on Earth. For example, we identified an increase in misfolded muscle protein associated with aggregated proteasomes in the heart muscle cells.

            "task_progress": "Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low-Earth orbit, the Moon, and beyond. Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit reduced climbing ability, cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling, and diminished cardiac output. Analysis of gene expression in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric / extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and increased expression of genes encoding proteasome subunits (cellular garbage disposals).        We further examined the role of proteasomes and protein misfolding on a second flight. We sent flies expressing fluorescently labeled proteins that we could monitor when returned to Earth for misfolding (as protein plaques). We were also able to use staining techniques to monitor proteasome numbers. We observed dramatic increases in protein plaque number and size in flies exposed to micro g and these were co-localized with large proteasome aggregates. Remarkably, in long-QT causing seizure (sei) / human ether-a-go-go (hERG) mutants, proteasomal gene expression was already lower than wildtype at 1g , but under micro g we still observed an increase compared to the 1g ground controls. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.       Our experiments validated the use of Vented Fly Boxes (VFBs) for fly experiments that require minimal space and astronaut input yet provide significant insights into organismal function under low gravity. One unexpected outcome from our second flight was excessive fungal contamination of samples stored in the Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) incubator. This information should assist future experiments that use this equipment to ensure that the experiments are not compromised by external contaminants. Nevertheless, the inclusion of fly boxes that were maintained as backup for the original flight permitted us to complete our analyses. The complete gene expression dataset is available on NASA's GeneLab database. Although not part of our original proposal we also developed an assay to measure both gene and protein expression from the same tissue source (brain) from the flies. Our analyses suggest that there are fundamental changes in proteins in metabolic pathways, circadian rhythm signaling, and the visual system that occur in micro g.  This dataset is also available on GeneLab.",

            "task_description": "The spaceflight environment influences immune cell distribution, ex vivo responses to antigen, and cytokine expression. However, few studies have characterized the impact of the spaceflight environment on the host immune response following an in vivo immune challenge, particularly those involving B cells and antibody production. The International Space Station (ISS) provides an ideal laboratory within which investigators can explore this unique environment and its impact on the host response. Through the use of a mouse model (with an immune system that closely parallels that of humans), we will establish a link between exposure to the spaceflight environment and decrements in immune system activation. This study is significant because it will directly test the hypothesis that host immunological health will be compromised in space.\nOn-orbit Flight Activities, Procedures, and Timeline\nMice will receive health checks upon unloading and transfer from the Transporter to the Habitat after capsule docking no later than 24 hrs after hatch opening. Animal health will then be monitored daily via continuous video recording from one camera at a time from all of the Habitats on-orbit (including other investigations which may be running concurrently) and down-linked to Ames science staff. Ground personnel shall have the option of programming or manually controlling which camera is being down-linked and recorded at any given time. Water levels will be checked every 3-4 days. After a minimum of 14 days after animal transfer from the Transporter to the Habitat, all 20 mice will be moved to the MSG and receive intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle (5 mice), Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine (5 mice), CpG ODN adjuvant (5 mice), or TT vaccine + CpG ODN adjuvant (5 mice). The dose of TT and/or CpG ODN will be 10 microg/ mouse and 40 microg/ mouse, respectively.  Pre-mixed doses will be prepared preflight in 100 microl saline and stored at -20 to -30°C until the appropriate time point. All injections and blood draws will use a 1 mL 26G 3/8” tuberculin syringe.  All injections will be i.p.\nBefore use, the CpG adjuvant must be stored at -20°C or colder until use and the TT vaccine must be stored at 4°C. At 14 +/- 2 days after injection, mice will be transferred to the MSG and sacrificed via an i.p. injection of 100/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine mixture, followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately following the blood collection, the spleens from the mice will be removed, sectioned into halves, and placed in a frozen environment (minimum temperature -80°C) until returned to Earth. Following spleen collection, the remains of the mouse carcass will be wrapped in tin foil, put in a zip-lock bags and placed in a -80°C environment (or colder) to preserve the tissues for future biospecimen sharing. Blood must not be allowed to sit at ambient temperature for longer than 1 hour post-collection; if operational requirements require the blood collected to be stored in excess of 1 hour before centrifugation, the blood must be transferred to a 4°C environment until centrifugation, for a period not to exceed 4 hours. Blood collected will be separated into solid and serum/plasma fractions by centrifugation and frozen at -80°C until returned to Earth. Storage times for both spleen and blood of up to 6 months at -80°C are acceptable.\nTime\nActivity &\nEstimated Time Required\nThermal Req.\nComments, Location &\nSpecial Considerations\nLaunch to L + 45 days\nAnimal health checks via video monitoring; water    level checks every 3-4 days\n20 – 30°C\nVideo downlink required for health checks\nTransfer to Habitat + 14 d\nAll 20 mice will be transferred to habitat\n20 – 30°C\nRequires transfer to and from Habitat with MTB;\nInjection + 14d +/- 2 d\nAt specific time points, all 20 mice will be    removed from AEM and given appropriate injection\n20 – 30°C / -80°C\nRequired transfer to MSG for injections\nDissection + 0 d\nMice euthanized, blood drawn and centrifuged and    spleen sectioned and frozen.

Habitats will be kept at a regular 12hr:12hr day:night light cycle to match the day/night programmed to be synchronous with the crew’s day/night cycle upon arrival. Water refill of habitats shall be performed. To prevent rodent food bars from becoming too hard or soiled, they will be replaced with a fresh food bar plate (from 4°C storage) at a time to not exceed 30 days after the introduction of mice to a Habitat.\nGround Activities Accompanying On-orbit Activities and Timeline\nGround controls will be run following spaceflight environmental parameters in orbital environmental simulator(s) (OES) chambers at KSC ACF. Delay between launch and start of environmental controls may be up to 8 days, depending on the logistics and capability of the telemetry system. Mice will be housed in flight Habitats with RFB diet and lixit water to match on-orbit groups. The operations done on ground will be conducted to match the same relative time points during the day/night cycle of the animals on-orbit, so that procedures on ground control mice are conducted at the same points in the animals’ circadian rhythm.\nEach experimental group for ground controls will be doubled to improve the statistical significance of the experiment with a total of 40 mice (4 groups of 10). Therefore, 2 Transporters will be required for the flight in orbital environmental simulator(s) (OES) that have been programmed with telemetry data from the flight. At the same relative time point (accounting for delay in starting ground controls after flight) the mice are transferred from the Transporter to the Habitat, the 40 ground control mice will be transferred from the 2 Transporters into 4 Habitats, and maintained in OES programmed with telemetry data from the ISS. OES shall be programmed to mimic the following conditions experienced by the Transport and then the Habitat: CO2, O2, temperature, and humidity.\nInjection and dissection must be performed as close as possible to how they are done on-orbit. In particular, the time of day that mice are sacrificed and dissected on the ground should match the same point in the circadian rhythms of the mice on-orbit. However, dissections or ground control mice can be conducted on standard laboratory benches/tables with chairs that are more ergonomic to the operators. For ground controls, dissection pins or needles may be used to pin down mice for dissection, as can spray bottles of wetting the mice before dissection. Flight hardware is required when it may affect the tissue dissection or preservation, such as having flight cold blocks in mini cold bags for tissue freezing.\nMice will receive health checks daily via video in the Habitat and water levels will be checked every 3-4 days. After a minimum of 14 days in the OES, all 40 mice will receive an i.p. injection of vehicle (10 mice), TT vaccine (10 mice), CpG adjuvant (10 mice), or TT vaccine + CpG adjuvant (10 mice).

            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "According to the National Institute of Aging (NIA), “Life expectancy nearly doubled during the 20th century with a ten-fold increase in the number of Americans age 65 or older.”  Furthermore, “there are approximately 35 million Americans age 65 or older, and this number is expected to double in the next 25 years.” Consequently, there is a rapidly growing need to understand the mechanisms underlying age-associated illness. Indeed, in the last decade, research has repeatedly demonstrated an impact of aging on immune function. Low-grade increases in circulating inflammatory cytokine secretion are often associated with senescence. Furthermore, studies suggest that these disruptions are likely due to decrements in cellular repair mechanisms and/or increases in antigenic load. Given this disruption in immune function, it is perhaps not surprising that many of the diseases associated with aging — such as type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease — have strong inflammatory underpinnings.\nThere are strong indications that the physiological effects of spaceflight are also similar to those seen in senescence. For instance, evidence suggests that age-associated enhancements in inflammatory cytokines are linked to changes in adipose tissue and energy balance. Similar links between metabolism, adipose tissue, and inflammation have also been shown to manifest in astronauts and animal models after exposure to spaceflight.  We propose to use long-term exposure to the spaceflight environment to model the effects of aging on immune function. Although these initial studies involve mice, the next obvious step in this work will be to work directly with astronauts.  Because astronauts tend to be extremely healthy, these effects will not be influenced by confounding factors such as clinically relevant, age-related disease. Also, because the effects of spaceflight on immunity are temporary, generally returning to baseline levels post-flight, this will ultimately give us some insight into whether or not the effects of aging are, indeed, reversible.\nAlthough many different aspects of immune function are influenced by both aging and spaceflight, these experiments will focus on B cells and the generation of antibodies.  Specifically, we will use next generation RNA sequencing techniques to characterize the B cell Ig heavy chain in animals that are challenged with tetanus toxoid.  The Ig heavy chain is the component of antibodies responsible for identifying specific sections of the tetanus toxoid, thereby coordinating subsequent immune responses.  Comparisons will be made between the B cell repertoires generated on ISS and on Earth.  The changes in B cell Ig heavy chain usage will provide indications whether the spaceflight environment affects the B cells that respond to antigen.  This, in turn, will help us understand the impact of aging on B cell function.\nWe anticipate that we will obtain several data sets which have relevance to spaceflight and/or have general significance to understanding host immune responsiveness.  These data include:   1)\tData that show that spaceflight either maintains or alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts;     2)\tInformation that demonstrates how immunization with an immunogen, commonly used in human medicine, alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts in the absence of the spaceflight variable;    3)\tDeterminations how activation of B cells through Tlr9 receptors alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts.\nWe will ascertain if activation of B cells through Tlr9 receptors can reverse any impact that may occur during spaceflight."

            "task_progress": "Project History and Review of Specific Aims\nThis project was submitted and funded in response to the NASA Research Announcement NNH12ZTT001N: Research Opportunities in Space Biology. This multidisciplinary project was to include three independent investigators and two institutions (Loma Linda University/LLU and Kansas State University/KSU, in addition to NASA). Since then, due to a series of unpredictable events, this project has evolved to include a number of ground-based analog studies, multiple analyses of flight tissues, and an actual flight study. We designated this experiment as Tetanus Antibody Response from B-cells In Space (TARBIS).\nThe original project involved three different experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to characterize different aspects of the antibody response. We proposed to immunize mice with the established tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine. This would allow us to generate an antigen-specific antibody response in our mouse model while using a clinically-relevant antigen. Our goal was to determine the impact of the spaceflight environment on primary and secondary antibody responses. C57BL/6J mice were challenged with a TT vaccine either before launch or during their stay on the ISS, as appropriate. Blood and spleen were to be collected in orbit from mice 2 weeks after primary or secondary immunization. Vaccination and assessment schedules would have been matched in ground-based controls. The antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatment groups.\nDue to the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and a greater-than 2-year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved in 2015 to modify the aims of NNX13AN34G to include a Flight Definition Phase. Much of the work between 2015 and 2018 involved completing the Flight Definition phase work and publishing the results. In 2017-2018, we requested a funding augmentation and began preparations for our spaceflight mission. As this process evolved, two of our originally proposed experiments were combined into one flight experiment. During this period a Co-Investigator, Dr. Keith Chapes, announced that he would be retiring from KSU. With his retirement, all experimental operations were moved to LLU. Previously, this work was completed at KSU in Dr. Chapes’ lab. Dr. Chapes continued his role as a Co-I as an independent consultant. In 2019, this experiment flew as TARBIS/Rodent Research-12. In the years between 2019 and the present, we were involved with a number of other flight-related opportunities, including several Biospecimen Sharing Program dissections and RR-18.  Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted and delayed multiple activities during this period.     Flight Definition Phase Work\n1. Analysis of spleen tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research - 1 (RR-1) verification flight.\nWe analyzed spleen RNA from these tissues (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 ground controls). We have determined IgH usage of the spleen B cells in these mice (flight vs. ground controls). We also generated total RNASeq on the RNA to have a matching data set to the liver RNASeq that is being done by the NASA GeneLab.\nWe analyzed GeneLab sequencing data that was available from the GeneLab database (GLDS-47, GLDS-48). The number of immunoglobulin reads (either heavy or light chain) were quite low, less than 1% of what we had obtained in preliminary analysis of spleen cells and tissue. We first attributed this low yield to short sequencing reads from the HiSeq sequencing method that Genelab did and provided in the database. Therefore, we sequenced both splenic (funded by another grant) and liver RNA from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) validation flight, which was made available by the NASA Ames Research Center (n=3 ground, n=3 flight). RNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (300bp, 2x) at the Kansas State Integrated Genomics Facility. Sequencing data was quality trimmed using CLC Genomics Workbench and mapped to reference libraries obtained from the  ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database. Data sets were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for Complementarity Determining Region 3 (CDR3) characterization.\nThe analysis of liver (quantified as part of the tissue sharing grant, NNX15AB45G) vs. spleen (quantified as part of THIS grant) reads indicated that liver immunoglobulin gene reads range from 0.26% of spleen immunoglobulin gene reads to 0.91%. The number of reads ranges from less than 100 to no greater than 622, depending on the sample. Although useful, publishable data from the spleen can be obtained (preliminary data presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) and presented in the GeneLab workshop by Chapes and Ward), the liver sequencing will not provide meaningful immunoglobulin gene data, even when the more comprehensive MiSeq next generation sequencing (NGS) platform is used to sequence. The liver data won’t be of any value and will not fulfill our goal of doing tissue comparisons. Other data from the MiSeq NGS data sets will be useful for other data mining attempts and will be made available to the GeneLab. Therefore, these sequencing runs allowed us to narrow our focus and not waste time on liver analyses. [Ed. Note: For information on the tissue sharing grant, see NASA Grant # NNX15AB45G; PI: Chapes. For ASGSR and other References, see the Cumulative Bibliography for this project.]\n2. An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight.\nIn this protocol, mice were subjected to AOS. Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways: phosphate buffer saline (PBS), unmethylated cytosine–guanine dinucleotide motifs (CpG), tetanus toxoid (TT), and TT with CpG. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we sacrificed the mice and collected a variety of tissues for further analysis. These are the same treatment groups that were proposed for our ISS studies. We used female C57BL/6J mice, 10-12 weeks old at the start of unloading. Independent variables were Tetanus Toxoid, CpG adjuvant, and hindlimb unloading. Blood and spleen were analyzed as part of this grant (NNX13AN34G). Assays at Loma Linda University included blood, TT specific IgG, IgA, IgM, and non-specific Ig levels. Kansas State University completed analyzing the IgH & IgK repertoire based on RNAseq.\nThe AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during spaceflight (Chapes, Mastro et al. 1993). [Ed. Note: See References.] Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 (5 mice per treatment group); Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 (5 mice per treatment group). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS. Two weeks later, the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways: PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG. Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we sacrificed the mice and collected a variety of tissues. This protocol was followed so that when mice were flown to the ISS, we would have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables. Serum, spleen, liver, and bone marrow were collected specifically to compare with our flight project.\nBriefly, we were able to confirm that i.p. injections – as opposed to the more typical intramuscular (i.m.) injection for vaccines – of TT resulted in an antibody response and that this response was augmented by an order of magnitude when mice were also given the CpG adjuvant. However, AOS had little impact on the ability to generate TT-specific antibodies, at least in the blood. AOS increased circulating corticosterone levels and a number of cytokines/chemokines, including GCSF, IL-1a, IL-5, IL-6, IP-10, and KC.\nImpact of AOS on the Spleen Ig Repertoire\nWe explored the impact of skeletal unloading using the AOS model and mice were experimentally challenged with TT and/or the adjuvant CpG. AOS did alter constant gene usage, resulting in higher levels of IgM and lower levels of IgG. CpG also altered constant gene region usage, increasing usage of IgA. Significant changes could be detected in multiple V-, D-, and J-gene segments in both the heavy and light chains in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatments. Analysis of class-switched-only transcripts revealed a different pattern of V-gene segment usage than detected in the whole repertoire and also showed significant alterations in gene segment usage after challenge. Alterations in V/J pairing were also detected in response to challenge. CDR3 amino acid sequence overlaps were similar among treatment groups, though the addition of CpG lowered overlap in the heavy chain. We isolated 3,045 whole repertoire and 98 potentially TT-specific CDR3 sequences for the heavy chain and 569 for the light chain. Our results demonstrate that AOS alters the repertoire response to challenge with TT and/or CpG.\nImpact of AOS on the Bone Marrow Ig Repertoire\nIn the same AOS experiment, the bone marrow antibody repertoire was characterized – including V-, D- (heavy only), and J-gene segment usage, constant region usage, CDR3 length, and V(D)J combinations. We detected changes in gene-segment usage in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatment in both the heavy and light chains of bone marrow B cells. Additionally, changes were seen in the class-switched VH-gene repertoire. Alterations were also detected in V/J pairing for both the heavy and light chains, and changes CDR3 length. We also detected lower levels of CDR3 AA overlap than detected in the splenic repertoire. These results demonstrate that AOS, TT, and CpG alter the bone marrow antibody repertoire; however, it is still unclear from both the spleen and the bone marrow data whether there is a loss of host antigen-specific responsiveness because of the change in gene use.\nMiSeq analysis of the spleen was completed at KSU. Originally, we had intended to perform a similar analysis of the liver. However, as described above, this analysis was ineffective and we opted to analyze bone marrow instead. In addition, we characterized changes in circulating corticosterone and found that AOS led to a significant increase. Furthermore, we noted a trend for the AOS response to be augmented in TT treated mice.\nAlthough the tissue analyses were slightly different from those described in the original proposal, the aim of doing multiple tissue assessments/comparisons was accomplished. This is a high-science return. We also believe that results from these studies will augment the data from the flight experiments, confirming the efficacy of AOS as a model for spaceflight for immune endpoints.\n3. NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Anti-orthostatic Suspension Experiment in Collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Blaber.\nDue to the nature of the studies described above, we were unable to use the blood or spleen tissue collected in the LLU experiments described above to characterize the impact of unloading on WBC populations. Furthermore, the funding and flight requirements for our flight project did not allow us to compare male vs. female mice. Fortuitously, the opportunity arose to look at blood populations in a study with a design similar to our own. This project involved Elizabeth Blaber, Ph.D. at Ames Research Center. [Ed. Note: See Space Biology projects under PI: Blaber in the NASA Task Book.]\nThe focus of Dr. Blaber’s study was to study the impact of p21 on bone, muscle, and stem cells. Male and female mice were suspended for 15 or 30 days (the latter timepoint is very similar to the 28 day unloading in our AOS studies). At the appropriate timepoint, mice were sacrificed and tissues were collected immediately. We characterized blood populations using an ABC Vet automatic hematology analyzer. In addition, we collected adrenals, brain, cerebellum, eye, liver, and skin tissue and froze them in liquid nitrogen. Although we were primarily interested in the wild type controls for this study, we collected tissues from both wild type controls and the p21 knockout mice.\nOur analyses of the blood indicated that unloading decreased all of the major leukocyte population counts. This decrease was generally more pronounced in the lymphocyte subset than in the other populations. Female mice tended to have higher cell counts than males, but there was no significant unloading x sex interaction on any subset. Finally, counts were similar between wild-type controls and p21 knockouts for all populations.\n4. Tetanus Toxoid Validation Test\nIn 2018, we were told that our flight experiment would be the focus of Rodent Research - 12 (RR-12). Because our initial assessment of the tetanus toxoid was several years old, we ran a small verification test on a new lot of the toxoid to ensure that biological activity of the vaccine would be as expected during the launch. This dose response study focused around the dose optimized in previous tests. Endpoints include TT-specific IgG levels. This experiment was performed in March of 2019. While we were able to verify that the same dose of TT could be use with in RR-12, we found that the CpG adjuvant was not as effective as in previous experiments.  As a consequence, we were approved to double the CpG dose as part of the flight experiment.\n5.  An Analysis of the Effects of Spaceflight and Vaccination on Antibody Repertoire Diversity\nAs part of this project, our group had the opportunity to examine the antibody repertories in C57Bl/6 mice after a number of different situations. These data allowed us a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that antibody diversity can be altered by physiological adaptation. That is, spaceflight, simulated spaceflight and/or immune responses are disruptions in stable environment and affect antibody diversity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed antibody diversity, as expressed by CDR3 amino acids, in four experiments and five data sets we have generated, using analyses frequently used to assess communities in ecological contexts; specifically, the Shannon Index (SI), an established measure of diversity. We discovered a trend towards lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in SI between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the antibody repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.\n6.  A Comparison of Unamplified and Massively Multiplexed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification for Murine Antibody Repertoire Sequencing\nWe started this project with the hypothesis that an unamplified Immunoglobulin gene data set would provide comparable results to those seen in the commercially amplified data sets. However, there were no immunoglobulin repertoire studies done to compare data obtained using amplification techniques compared to the repertoire in a total RNASeq library. Concurrent with performing these analyses, we discovered that the required sample preparation for commercial sequencing also varied. Therefore, we found it necessary to examine the impact of sample preparation as part of our effort. This preflight verification work compared a data set generated using unamplified total RNA (TRNA) to commercially amplified data sets. We examined the role of commercial amplification and cDNA generation methods, as well as the impact of the starting material on sequence output.  We found that sequencing of unamplified splenic RNA provides a realistic snapshot of the total splenic B cell repertoire. We also demonstrated that a good understanding of the bioinformatics workflow and reporting of the methodology is critical and cannot be understated. We established that there are cellular biases and transcript stability differences within B cell subpopulations. However, for the purpose of assessing a whole tissue B cell repertoire, unamplified RNASeq was capable of providing a valuable glimpse of the most prevalent B cell clones. Most importantly, an unamplified data set may detect V-gene segments that amplified data sets miss.\nFlight Activities\nOur flight investigation was launched on NG-11 out of NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility (Wallops) on 4/17/19. At the request of NASA, this flight experiment combined experiments 1 and 2 of our original proposal, including: 1) a primary challenge in space, and 2) a primary challenge pre-flight + a secondary challenge in space. Members of our team participated in the baseline, environmental control, and vivarium control vaccinations and tissue collection at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). All of these events were on a 3-4 day delay after similar procedures were performed by the ISS astronauts. Collected tissues for ground controls were frozen and shipped to LLU and stored in our freezers at -80°C. A subset of the flight blood and spleen samples were returned from the ISS and shipped to LLU to our lab in August 2019. The remaining samples and frozen carcasses of our flight mice were returned and shipped to LLU in January 2020.\nWe performed a tetanus toxoid specific IgG/IgA/IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on the blood samples from this study. There were some issues with the samples brought back from the ISS. Specifically, there was significant lysing of the red blood cells (RBCs) and we were unable to separate the cells from the plasma in roughly half of the cells. However, despite these difficulties, we were able to detect Ig in the appropriate samples.\nThe data suggest that both the CpG adjuvant and a secondary inoculation with the vaccine increased the antibody responses as expected on the ground. The difference in scale for the primary vs. secondary response figures indicates that under normal circumstances, B cell memory developed and responded as expected. However, both the primary and secondary responses were drastically inhibited after flight. There are several possible reasons for this. Decreases in the efficacy of 1) the adjuvant, 2) antigen presentation, 3) B cell memory development after the primary injection, or 4) overall cell death in B cell counts are all possibilities. The approval of our last flight experiment (where both the primary and secondary inoculations occur in orbit) is crucial to help identify the actual mechanism.\nSummary of Work: 2020 - 2021\nCOVID-19 Related Delays\nLoma Linda University went on COVID-related lockdown in March 2020. At that time, all staff were strongly encouraged to work from home if possible. Much of the work associated with this grant involved tissue processing and data analysis. While the data analysis could continue (we were able to get permission for our postdoc to connect remotely to our server), the tissue processing was put on hold. This coincided with a shutdown at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for both COVID-related issues and a temporary university-wide power failure that halted processing for several weeks.\nDue to the uncertainty related to COVID, both of our postdocs (Drs. Trisha Rettig and John Tan) opted to move on to other positions. Dr. Rettig left for a position in industry on 10/5/2020. Dr. Tan moved on to a faculty position within LLU on 6/30/2020. Similarly, our research technician, Nina Nishiyama, moved on to go to graduate school at the University of North Carolina on July 17, 2020.\nSummary of Work 2021 - 2023\nPersonnel Changes\nIn 2021, we requested an augmentation to continue the work on this project due to a variety of COVID-related delays and personnel changes. As part of this request, we included salary for half of a technician, a postdoc and a grad student. The funding was approved and the revised cooperative agreement was signed in December of 2021. For well over a year, we were unable to identify a grad student and post-doc to continue working on this project. This was likely due to 1) the difficulties associated with COVID, 2) the national downturn in grad school applications, and 3) the timing for the additional funding (i.e., in the middle of Loma Linda University’s academic year). We were finally able to identify both a grad student and post-doc at the end of 2022.  However, shortly thereafter, our grad student had to take a prolonged leave of absence due to health-related issues.  He returned to work in the summer of 2023.\nChanges in Antibody Repertoire Analysis\nAfter several delays and mishaps beyond our control, we had to make a change in our analysis, switching our antibody repertoire analysis away from the facility at Kansas State University and going with the company iRepertoire. For the first 4-5 months of 2022, we dealt with supply chain related delays trying to get the samples checked and prepped to send. We were finally able to send these tissues out to begin processing in the summer of 2022.\nTissue Collection with BSP\nFor about three weeks in October of 2021, personnel from the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at NASA  Ames Research Center (Ames) traveled to Loma Linda University to help with the tissue collection from the RR-12/TARBIS mice (frozen in orbit at the time of the mission). This was originally supposed to happen back in 2019 but was delayed considerably for a variety of reasons, including COVID-related facility shutdowns. These tissues were either shipped to Ames and added to the BSP tissue archives or shipped to co-investigators for analysis.\nAdditional Opportunities in Collaboration with Dr. Xiao Wen “Vivian” Mao\nIn January-February of 2022, several members of the TARBIS team joined Dr. Xiao Wen Mao in support of her RR-18 Live Animal Return (LAR) tissue collection at the Roskamp Institute in Florida (NASA Grant #NNX15AB41G). Although Dr. Pecaut is a Co-investigator on Dr. Mao’s grant, he also collected additional tissues as part of the BSP (specifically, spleen). Because our RR-12/TARBIS tissues were collected and frozen in orbit, we were not able to perform any functional assays or flow cytometry-based phenotype analysis. Fortunately, Dr. Mao’s flight parameters were very similar to one of our RR-12 flight experiments (i.e., ~ 4 week flight time). Therefore, we used this opportunity to do phenotyping and cytokine expression to complement our antibody analysis from our previous flight. This also complements our ground-based centrifuge study (\"Spaceflight Impacts the Microbiome-Brain Axis\" or “SIMBA”, NASA Grant #: 80NSSC19K1038) which was also for 4 weeks. This analysis is ongoing.\nIn April-May of 2022, Dr. Mao’s second RR-18 dissection occurred. This study was designed to look at the recovery responses 2-3 months after landing. Although we do not have RR-12/TARBS data that would directly correspond with this recovery period, we felt knowing the phenotype distribution and cytokine responses would inform us of the long-term consequences of spaceflight on populations critical to the antibody response.\nCurrent Status\nThroughout the final months of this project, both our post-doc and graduate student have been working on analyzing the data generated by iRepertoire.  This analysis is ongoing even though the funds for this project have ceased.\nREFERENCES\nChapes SK, Mastro AM, Sonnenfeld G, Berry WD.

            "task_description": "This research proposal is aimed at better understanding the basic bone biological effects of various osteoporosis treatments as therapies for reducing or preventing bone loss due to space flight. The project will study hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, which is a technique that is well established as an effective and informative ground-based analog for studying the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system. In order to better understand the detailed effects of each, the treatments will be studied separately. The four treatments to be examined include two anabolic (bone building) therapies and two anti-resorptive therapies. One anabolic approach will use voluntary exercise and the other a new osteoporosis drug (anti-sclerostin antibody). Anti-resorptive drugs are the most popular for treating clinical osteoporosis and achieve their benefits by preventing bone resorption, which is part of the normal cycle of bone replenishment. Furthermore, the treatments will be used as pre-treatments and only administered prior to HU exposure. This is not realistic for astronauts, but it will allow more in-depth study of the fundamental nature of each treatment, and it will also align with the anticipated requirements of possible follow-up space flight experiments using the same rat animal model. The experiments to be conducted will characterize beneficial effects of pre-treatment upon bone loss due to HU as well as bone recovery following HU and return to weightbearing. Bone properties will be quantified using CT-based analyses, histological techniques for assessing bone cell function, as well as biomechanical testing to measure strength.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Completion of the studies outlined in this research proposal will provide new insights into the basic nature of the effects of exercise and pharmaceutical agents and how these interact with mechanical unloading and recovery therefrom.  Removal of weightbearing through hindlimb unloading is a severe and acute form of mechanical disuse that has been shown to simulate many of the effects of microgravity exposure due to space flight on the musculoskeletal system. Hindlimb unloading also induces many musculoskeletal system changes that are similar to accelerated aging as well as other disuse scenarios such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular impairment.  Thus, insights gained should also help advance basic understanding of the fundamental biology associated with Earth-bound clinical medicine as well as space flight effects.  Future space flight experiments can be designed to replicate the research to be conducted in this proposed project, and comparing results from the two will provide essential and more detailed understanding of the full efficacy, as well as limitations, of the adult rat HU model as a ground-based analog for human space flight.  Studying these treatments separately is not necessarily realistic for actual mission scenarios, but the results will nevertheless provide evidence-based rational data for contemplating and designing possible co-therapies using either combinations (simultaneously) or possible sequential scheduling protocols."

            "task_progress": "As explained in previous year progress reports, an adjustment was made during year 1 to reverse the order of the two animal experiments.  In the proposal, the first set of animal studies (Experiment 1) was to address Specific Aim 1, which compares two anabolic pre-treatments, but we decided to change this to address Specific Aim 2 first.  A major consideration driving this change was to allow more time to acquire the Sclerostin-Antibody drug.  Four experimental groups were needed for each of the two sets of animal experiments as further described below.\nAnti-Resorptive Pre-Treatment Animal Work: The two anti-resorptive pre-treatments are both bisphosphonate drugs, specifically risedronate and alendronate.  The overall protocol structure can be defined as follows:\nPre-treatment (PT) period = days 0 to 28\nHindlimb unloading (HU) period = days 28 to 56\nAmbulating recovery (AR) period = days 56 to 112\nThe four groups are defined as follows:\nControl (CON) = normal cage activity for PT, HU, and AR periods\nHU Control (HUC) = normal cage for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nRisedronate (RIS) = RIS for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nAlendronate (ALN) = ALN for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nThe animal experiments were conducted in three cohorts of animals due to constraints and considerations associated with animal housing space, animal cages, and personnel requirements.  Each cohort involved 45-50 animals, with the scheduling timetable as follows:\nCohort 1 – 27 May 2014 to 9 Oct 2014\nCohort 2 – 15 July 2014 to 25 Nov 2014\nCohort 3 – 30 Sept 2014 to 10 Feb 2015\nAll animal experiments included in vivo measures that were made on all animals every 28 days.  The main assessment conducted was pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans, which are made at the proximal tibia metaphysis (PTM) and tibia diaphysis (TD) of anesthetized animals.  In addition, blood was drawn at 28-day intervals for possible serum analysis of bone activity biomarkers.\nAnabolic Pre-Treatment Animal Work: The four groups identified for the anabolic pre-treatment studies are defined below along with a schematic depiction of the animal protocols.  The two anabolic pre-treatments are pharmaceutical administration and mechanical loading through exercise.  The specific pharmaceutical agent used was an anti-sclerostin anti-body compound provided by Lilly (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) through a Material Transfer Agreement.  The mechanical loading anabolic treatment consisted of a voluntary rat jumping protocol intended to simulate resistance exercise.\nThe overall protocol structure is again defined as follows:\nPre-treatment (PT) period = days 0 to 28\nHindlimb unloading (HU) period = days 28 to 56\nAmbulating recovery (AR) period = days 56 to 112\nThe four groups are defined as follows:\nControl (CON) = normal cage activity for PT, HU, and AR periods\nHU Control (HUC) = normal cage for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nSclerostin Anti-body (SCL) = SCL for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nExercise (REX) = REX for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nThe same in vivo measures were made on all animals every 28 days; specifically, pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans were made at the PTM and TD of anesthetized animals, and blood was drawn at 28-day intervals for possible serum analysis of bone activity biomarkers.\nMajor milestones for the anabolic pre-treatment portions of the project are summarized as follows:\nJuly – December 2015: •\tMaterial Transfer Agreement (MTA) completed July 2015 ; •\tReceipt of initial shipment of Scl-Ab October 2015\nNovember – December 2015: •\tPilot study for Scl-Ab dosing ; •\tPilot study for voluntary jumping exercise\nJanuary – September 2016:\n•\tAnimal work for Scl-Ab drug pre-treatment conducted in 3 cohorts:\nCohort 1 – 26 Jan 2016 to 22 June 2016 (20 Scl-Ab; 5 REX)\nCohort 2 – 18 Apr 2016 to 31 Aug 2016 (13 Scl-Ab)\nCohort 3 – 5 May 2016 to 14 Sept 2016 (12 Scl-Ab)\nSeptember – December 2016: •\tContinued refinement of voluntary jumping exercise details and new cages\nJanuary 2017 – April 2018: •\tAnimal work for voluntary jumping exercise (REX) conducted in 4 cohorts  \t\tCohort 1 – 10 Jan 2017 to 16 May 2017 (10 REX)\nCohort 2 – 13 June 2017 to 14 Nov 2017 (10 REX)\nCohort 3 – 13 Sept 2017 to 10 Feb 2018 (10 REX)\nCohort 4 – 12 Dec 2017 to 8 Apr 2018 (10 REX)\nAs reflected above, a decision was made to stagger the two parts of the anabolic pre-treatment arm of the project.  The Scl-Ab (pharmacologic) pre-treatment part was done first and was completed in September 2016.  The voluntary jumping exercise (REX) pre-treatment part was resumed in January 2017 and continued into to 2018.  Two factors prompted the strategy to stagger the Scl-Ab and REX parts of the study.  First, the duration of the window of availability for the sclerostin anti-body compound was uncertain, so it was deemed best to acquire all of the material that was promised as soon as possible and reasonable.  The second factor was that the voluntary jumping exercise required additional refinements and adjustments in order to make it practical and effective for the remaining 40 animals scheduled to conduct the jumping exercises.  Five animals were included in the first cohort of the Scl-Ab pre-treatment part, and the knowledge gained from that was used to adjust and improve the process.  Most prominently, the customized cages required for acclimating, training, and exercising the animals needed to be redesigned and new ones constructed.  Consequently, the first of the four remaining REX cohorts was not started until January 2017.  In addition, the labor-intensive nature of the jumping exercise training protocol dictates a maximum of 10 animals per cohort, as reflected in the summary above.\nAn overall summary of the major in vivo and ex vivo measurements is as follows.\nIn Vivo Longitudinal Measures\nDensitometry by pQCT (left tibia; proximal metaphysis and midshaft) ; ~ vBMD, BMC, cross-sectional area, cross-sectional moment of inertia, etc.\nEx Vivo Endpoint Measures\nDensitometry by pQCT (tibia; proximal metaphysis and midshaft): ~ vBMD, BMC, cross-sectional area, cross-sectional moment of inertia, etc.\nDensitometry and microstructure by microCT (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN) ; ~ trabecular microarchitecture, vBMD, BMC, TMD, etc.\nStatic and dynamic histomorphometry (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN): ~ trabecular, cortical, MS/BS, MAR, BFR, etc.\nBone Strength (tibia metaphysis RPC, tibia & femur midshaft, FN): ~ ultimate load, stiffness, ultimate strength, elastic modulus, toughness, etc.\nMuscle Weights (hindlimb posterior crural muscles): ~ wet weights for gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris\nAll in vivo pQCT measurements have been made and data analyzed.\nAlmost all of the ex vivo measurements have been completed as well.\nResults have been disseminated to date primarily through conference abstracts, posters, and presentations, as indicated in the Bibliography section.  One journal article has been published.\nTwo PhD students are finishing their dissertations in fall 2019 (Jessica Brezicha) and spring 2020 (Scott Lenfest).  These dissertation research projects focus on the two anabolic pre-treatments, sclerostin anti-body and voluntary jumping exercise, respectively.  Because of the sequential and inter-dependent nature of the animal experiments, outcome measures gathered, and subsequent data analyses, dissemination through journal articles has been delayed.  Publications should be readily forthcoming from the completed dissertation work of these two PhD students.  Publication of the earlier results for the two bisphosphonate drug pre-treatments is also being coordinated with publication of the anabolic pre-treatment results to permit detailed comparisons and more in-depth consideration.",

The central objective of this study is to determine what proteins are deferentially expressed during space flight in developing Arabidopsis seedlings.  A body of research has evaluated the differential gene expression on space flight vs ground controls, but gene expression provides an indirect measure of what proteins are expressed.  Genes may be transcribed but the transcripts degraded, or translated proteins may be regulated through post translational modifications.  We used BRIC-PDFU (Biological Research In Canisters - Petri Dish Fixation Unit) hardware on a Rapid Turn-Around Space Flight Experiment to gain insights into differences in protein profiles between Arabidopsis seedlings grown during space flight and ground based controls.  Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated, grown, and tissues fixed on orbit.  Once returned to Earth, total protein was extracted, labeled with iTRAQ reagents, and analyzed for differences in protein profiles, both expression levels and post translational modifications.  These data complement the gene expression data currently available from space flight experiments and also provide novel insights into differences in post-transcriptional regulation.    They have also provided a foundation for a network analysis to generate additional hypotheses as to the mechanisms involved in gravity perception/response in plants.",

Just to reiterate, roughly 20,000 Arabidopsis Wild Type (WT) Col-0 seeds were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) using PDFU-BRIC hardware. After approximately 3 days, seedlings were fixed using RNAlater® and frozen at -80oC until return to Earth. A duplicate set of WT Col-0 seeds was maintained at Kennedy Space Center, also in PDFU-BRIC hardware, as a ground control. Two additional sets of seedlings, not in PDFU-BRIC hardware but in enclosed containers, were maintained at Ohio University under similar environment conditions as hardware and fixative controls for the space flight samples. Proteins were analyzed using iTRAQ 8-plex tandem mass spectrometry at Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, MO. RNAseq was performed at Washington University, St. Louis, MO.\nRNA. In space flight and ground controls, 2641 soluble and 2917 membrane proteins were identified using Mascot software (Matrix Biosciences) and the TAIR10 database. The fixative, RNALater, had no detrimental effect on protein quality or identification. Analysis of hardware controls revealed 1651 differentially expressed transcripts, 108 differentially abundant soluble, and 39 membrane proteins. Analysis of samples preserved with and without RNAlater revealed 2750 genes differentially expressed and 84 soluble and 120 membrane proteins. Fold enrichment analysis of fixative controls show evidence of desiccation stress on the transcriptome. Filtering the space flight data for those transcripts and proteins expressed in fixative and hardware controls revealed 571 transcripts, 59 soluble proteins, and 36 membrane proteins deferentially expressed only as a result of space flight. Further analysis will help reveal the processes/mechanisms affected by space flight.",

Although this condition is largely attributed to the direct effects of unloading of the bone, coupling mechanisms associated with diminished bone and marrow perfusion, attenuated fluid flow within the bone, and fewer signaling molecules from vascular cells may also play a modulating role on the bone loss associated with spaceflight.\nIn the tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rat, an animal model of microgravity-induced osteopenia, hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow decrease with acute unloading (10 min) and continue to progressively decline through 28 days of unloading. The initial and chronic decrements in perfusion are primarily due to increases in osseous vascular resistance. In addition, when the HU rat hindlimb skeleton is reloaded during standing, long bone and marrow perfusion are lower and vascular resistance higher than that in standing control animals. These higher vascular resistances in HU rats could result from 1) increased vasoconstrictor responses of bone resistance arteries, or 2) decreased endothelium-dependent and/or endothelium-independent vasodilator responsiveness of bone resistance arteries.\nSpecific Aims:\nAim 1. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the responsiveness of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) to myogenic and vasoconstrictor stimuli.\nAim 2. To evaluate the contribution of endothelium-derived NO (nitric oxide) and vasodilator prostaglandins to acetylcholine (ACh), bradykinin (BK), and flow-induced vasodilation in the femoral PNA from control and HU rats.\nAim 3. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the expression of endothelial NOS (eNOS), COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein, as well as M2-receptor (ACh) and B2-receptor (BK) mRNA, in the femoral PNA.\nAim 4. To determine whether hindlimb unloading alters the PNA responsiveness to endothelium-independent vasodilator stimuli.\nAim 5. To determine whether hindlimb unloading, radiation exposure, and the combined effects of these treatments alter endothelium-dependent vasodilation through NO or PGI2 signaling pathways, and to determine whether this is related to changes in bone volume and indices of cancellous bone micro-architecture.\nThe general hypothesis of this proposal is that skeletal unloading induces alterations in skeletal resistance artery function; these alterations serve to diminish bone perfusion and ultimately disrupt mechanisms for maintaining the normal balance between bone formation and bone resorption. The specific purpose is to elucidate vasoconstrictor and vasodilator mechanisms involved in the control of bone and marrow perfusion, including endothelial signaling pathways forming nitric oxide and prostacyclin, in bone during conditions of unloading, and to determine whether deficits in bone blood flow and endothelium-dependent vascular signaling are related to unloading-induced bone loss. To accomplish these goals, the principal nutrient artery of the femur from control and 14 day HU rats will be isolated and cannulated for in vitro experimentation. Mechanisms of smooth muscle and endothelial cell function in the osseous circulation will be determined, as well as how skeletal unloading alters these vasoconstrictor and vasodilator control mechanisms (Aims 1-4). Studies will then be conducted using adenoviral gene transfer (Aim 5) to manipulate bone and marrow perfusion and endothelium-dependent vasodilation to determine whether blood flow and vascular endothelial cell signaling is coupled to disuse-associated bone remodeling in the femur (i.e., bone formation rates, mass, total, cortical and cancellous bone mineral density, and mechanical strength). These studies will extend our knowledge and understanding of how skeletal unloading alters fluid and vascular coupling mechanisms, which have been suggested to modulate the balance of bone formation and degradation during microgravity. These studies may also provide new insight into the etiology of other degenerative bone disorders that occur concomitantly with cardiovascular dysfunction, such as heart disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and old age.",

Two additional manuscripts that will cite support from this grant are in preparation. In the first unpublished study, we examined whether simulated weightlessness and space-relevant irradiation of mice alters vascular responsiveness and bone properties 6-7 months after these treatment interventions, i.e., following a 6-7 period of normal weight bearing recovery. This period of recovery in mice is equivalent to approximately 20 human years. The data demonstrate that only high-LET (linear energy transfer) total body irradiation (TBI), but not hindlimb unloading (HU), has a sustained effect on endothelium-dependent vasodilation following the period of recovery, and that the combined effects of these two treatments (TBI-HU) to impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation is also sustained following the recovery period. The was a tendency for the trabecular bone volume fraction (trabecular bone volume/total bone volume) of the proximal tibia from TBI-HU mice to be lower than that in control mice, but this was not significant. Decrements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation are significantly correlated with changes in bone volume, indicating a coupling of vascular endothelial cell function is associated with bone loss induced by HU and TBI. This observation is similar to that which we reported earlier in mice where the effects of HU and TBI were determined immediately after the cessation of these treatments (Ghosh et al., Radiat. Res. 185: 257-266, 2016), although the relation between peak endothelium-dependent vasodilation and bone volume fraction was not as robust following the recovery period. Collectively, these data demonstrate the important relation between bone blood flow, bone vascular function, and trabecular bone volume.\nFor the second manuscript in preparation, we examined the effects of a commonly used countermeasure for spaceflight-induced bone loss (i.e., exercise) to determine its effect on bone blood flow. Like that shown to occur in hindlimb bones with chronic unloading (Stabley et al., 2013), old age also diminishes perfusion of bone marrow and regions of bone containing high volumes of trabecular bone. Results from this study demonstrate that 10-12 weeks of low-intensity exercise training (ET) restores bone perfusion in old (25-26 months old) rats to levels occurring in young adult (6 months old) animals. Thus, these data support the notion that regular physical activity maintains and improves bone perfusion and bone health.\nStabley JN, Prisby RD, Behnke BJ, Delp MD. \"Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.\" Bone. 2013 Dec;57(2):355-60.",

See that project for previous reports]\nThe major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.\nThese experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.\nA significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS.

            "task_progress": "Summary of Major Results\n***Project 1: Phototropic curvature***\nUtilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) on board the International Space Station (ISS), we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B.  Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1 g.  A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1 g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination.  Additionally, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be a product of directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravity.\n***Project 2: Gene Profiling***\nThe transcriptome of seedlings were analyzed from experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) to study the interacting effects of light and gravity on plant tropisms.  Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated and grown in cassettes in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for 4 days at 1g then exposed to a range of gravitational accelerations (microgravity, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53g, and 1g) and light treatments (blue light with or without a 1 hour pretreatment with red light).  At the end of the space experiments, the cassettes containing the seedlings were frozen in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) and returned to Earth on space shuttle STS-131.  The RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and used for the transcriptome analyses. A comparison of 1g-treated-spaceflight samples with ground controls identified 230 genes that were differentially regulated at least two-fold (p < 0.01). A further comparison of all spaceflight samples with ground controls identified approximately 280 genes that were differentially regulated at least two fold (p < 0.01).  Of these genes, several were involved in regulating cell polarity (i.e., auxin, calcium, lipid metabolism), cell wall development, oxygen status, and cell defense or stress. However, when the transcriptome of the all g-treated spaceflight samples were compared with microgravity samples, only approx.130 genes were identified as being differently regulated (p < 0.01). Of these, only 27 were at least 2 fold differently regulated between microgravity and 1g samples and included putatitive/pseudo/undefined genes (n=14), transposable elements (n=5), an expansin (ATEXP24; At1g21240), a cell-wall kinase (WAK3; At1g21240), a laccase-like flavonoid oxidase (TT10;At5g48100), among others.   Not surprisingly, there was a difference in the % of genes represented in individual gene categories when comparing spaceflight samples with ground controls and spaceflight microgravity versus spaceflight g-treated space samples.   These results emphasize the need for tissue fixation on the centrifuge for an accurate spaceflight control.  These results are one of the few reports of transcriptome analyses from a space experiment with plants that had gravity treatments using an on-board centrifuge.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by  \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

Yet, most investigations of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment have been carried out on the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

To fill this knowledge gap, we propose to investigate the growth, development, and transcriptome profiles of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings under spaceflight conditions, and compare these adaptive responses to those recently documented for Arabidopsis seedlings. These investigations will lead to a better understanding of the molecular and developmental mechanisms that contribute to Brachypodium adaptation to spaceflight conditions.

Because root growth and its architecture have recently been recognized as key contributors to plant productivity and adaptation to environmental stress, our research is also likely to have long-term impact in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. Furthermore, many of the behaviors under investigation involve auxin-related processes. This plant hormone is a key contributor to most aspects of plant growth, development, and response to the environment. Therefore, this project is likely to yield important new insights into some of the key mechanisms that control plant growth, development, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses."

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORTING NOVEMBER 2019:  Most of the studies of plant growth and adaptation to the microgravity environment have been carried out using Arabidopsis thaliana, a model dicot plant. However, most of the cultivated crops on Earth are monocots. Therefore, the purpose of our project was to investigate the impact of the microgravity environment present on the International Space Station (ISS) on the germination, growth, and morphology of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings, and evaluate their molecular adaptation to this environment using RNAseq analyses of transcription profiles. To do this, we first developed a new foam-based plant growth unit (named the APEX Growth Chamber), in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the Kennedy Space Center Flight Support Team. This chamber allows planting Brachypodium seeds within a block of foam on the ground, before flight. The seeds remain dry during take off and travel to the ISS. Upon arrival, an astronaut (Dr. Scott Tingle in our experiment) injects a nutritive solution into the foam, triggering seed germination and growth with the VEGGIE growth unit. Using this approach, we were able to grow 3 accessions of Brachypodium distachyon (Bd21, BD21-3, and Gaz-8) on ISS with four biological repeats per accession (four APEX Growth Chambers containing 24 seeds each). We also carried out two ground controls. One of these ground controls included germinating and growing the same accessions on the ground under conditions that mimicked those encountered on ISS, with a 48-h delay (ground control 1). A second ground control involved growing Bd21 seedlings under the same conditions for three days, followed by 5-min gravistimulation (GS) or 5-min mechanostimulation (MS) (ground control 2). At the end of each experiment, the seedlings were photographed, and the plant material was harvested and fixed in RNALater in KFT fixation units for subsequent analyses. Images were used to quantify root and shoot growth under both conditions, whereas plant materials were dissected to separate shoots and roots for subsequent expression profiling. RNA was extracted for RNASeq analysis. Our results show that the plants grown under microgravity displayed shorter, very hairy roots. Shoots were shorter in only one of the accessions tested (Bd21).\nExpression profiling revealed a large number of Bd21 genes whose expression either increased or decreased in shoots and/or roots under microgravity. Most of the differentially expressed genes were organ-specific, and did not respond to either GS or MS under ground-control conditions. The lists of microgravity-response genes were enriched for genes predicted to function in plant responses to environmental and oxidative stress as well as reactive oxygen species. They were also enriched for genes involved in radiation response, implying that Brachypodium might serve as a good model to investigate the effects of cosmic radiation on plants. Few of the microgravity-response genes were also differentially expressed in response to GS or MS on the ground. Those that did respond to both GS and microgravity constitute excellent candidates for a function in gravity signal transduction. Overall, our studies identify several genes and pathways that could be further engineered to improve monocot plant adaptation to the microgravity environment, facilitating their use in bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space-exploration missions.\nGround based studies were also carried out to investigate the natural variation that exists between Brachypodium accessions for root-growth and behavioral responses to GS. These studies led to the discovery of several key loci that may contribute to the regulation of proprioception in plants.\nExperimental Results and Conclusions\nDevelopment of a plant growth chamber to test Brachypodium distachyon seedlings growth under microgravity conditions\nTo test the ability of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings to germinate, grow, and adapt to the microgravity environment of the ISS, we developed a novel plant growth unit (named APEX Growth Chamber) in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the NASA Kennedy Space Center Flight Support team. This system is based on an Oasis foam-based growth system previously used by Dr. Levine to grow plants in space. With this setup, Brachypodium seeds are inserted pre-flight into a dry block of foam that is surrounded by gauze and a nylon mesh, and is mounted on a medium injection device within a Magenta-box assembly. The seeds are kept in a dormant dry state, unable to germinate during spaceflight to the ISS. When the experiment is ready for activation on ISS, an astronaut can easily inject liquid growth medium into the foam support through the injection device, thereby imbibing the seeds and triggering their germination under red light.\nThis novel plant germination and growth system had to be developed because early preparatory experiments had demonstrated that the far-red light pretreatment typically used to prevent the germination of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings on agar-based media during takeoff and travel to the ISS, has an opposite effect on agar-medium-embedded Brachypodium seeds, triggering their germination. An alternative light-based inhibition protocol we developed to inhibit Brachypodium seed germination during spaceflight could not be implemented because it required continuous seed exposure to blue-light and cold, thereby requiring excessive amounts of energy during a sensitive period of spaceflight.   Our flight experiment and corresponding ground control involved a total of 15 APEX Growth Units per condition, including 12 for each experiment, and 3 spare units. Three distinct accessions of Brachypodium distachyon were used, including Bd21 (whose genome serves as a reference for Brachypodium), Bd21-3 (which has been optimized for use in transformation experiments), and Gaz-8 (which displays different root-growth behaviors relative to Bd21 and Bd21-3 when grown on the ground). Four chambers (biological repeats) per accession were tested under microgravity conditions on ISS, and another four were exposed to 1-g on the ground under conditions that mimicked the flight experiment (ground control).\nThis material was prepared for flight to the ISS on March 27-30, 2018, and launched on Space X-14 on April 2, 2018. Upon transferring the 12 seeded APEX growth chambers from stowage into the ISS, astronaut Scott Tingle activated the experiment by injecting growth medium into the units on April 12, 2018. Seeds were allowed to germinate in the presence of red light for 24 hours, then blue and green lights were turned on and the plants were allowed to grow for three more days. At the end of this growth period, astronaut Tingle collected each APEX growth unit, took photographs of the seedlings growing on each face of the foam block, harvested the seedlings and placed them into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFT) for fixation in the presence of RNAlater. For each APEX Growth Unit, a few seedlings displayed roots that grew away from the foam surface and showed evidence of stress. These seedlings were harvested separately from those whose root tips were still contacting the block surface at harvesting time. Fixation in RNAlater was carried out at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The KFTs were then transferred to a cold storage device (-80°C) and returned to the ground on the Dragon capsule.\nThe environmental conditions experienced by the plants during their growth in VEGGIE on ISS were recorded, and then recapitulated in plant growth units at KSC during a first ground-based control. At the end of this experiment, the seedlings were also fixed in RNAlater at room temperature for 24 hours, then frozen at -80°C. These ground-control samples were also returned to the Principal Investigator (PI) laboratory, as were the pictures of seedlings grown under both microgravity and 1-g conditions.\nMicrogravity-grown seedlings are morphologically altered compared to ground-controls   The pictures of Brachypodium seedlings taken after 4 days of growth in the APEX Growth Units under microgravity and on the ground, were used to evaluate a potential effect of ISS-microgravity exposure on organs growth and seedling morphology. Seedlings of all three accessions displayed significantly shorter roots when grown under microgravity relative to ground controls. Furthermore, the shoots of microgravity-grown Bd21 seedlings were also shorter than ground controls, whereas those of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 were similar under both conditions. We conclude that Brachypodium distachyon accessions display distinct adaptive responses to the microgravity environment encountered on ISS. In addition to accession-specific alterations of organs growth, we also observed that the primary roots of microgravity-grown seedlings displayed longer root hairs than those of ground-control samples, and this phenotype was observed for all three accessions tested. This phenotype is rather surprising as previous studies had shown an opposite effect of microgravity on Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs (4).\nBrachypodium distachyon seedlings display organ-specific transcriptional responses to microgravity relative to ground control\nTo better understand the mechanisms that contribute to Brachypodium seedling adaptation to the microgravity environment of ISS, root and shoot tissues were dissected from frozen fixed Bd21 seedlings that had been exposed to the microgravity environment on ISS as well as ground-control materials. Total RNAs were extracted from these tissues and used to build TruSeq Stranded Total RNA libraries, which were sequenced in a Novaseq sequencer programmed to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. Library sequencing generated an average of 25 to 30 million reads per sample. Reads were trimmed to remove the adapter sequences using SKEWER, then filtered with FASTX_quality_filter to ensure that only high-quality reads (Phred scores above 35) are used for sequence alignments. The quality-filtered reads were mapped on the Brachypodium reference genome (version 3.1, from Phytozome) using the Bowtie2 algorithm. The TopHat 2 splice-junction mapper was used to compile transcript contigs, paying close attention to potential splice variants. HTseq-count was then used to define the numbers of reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) for genes and isoforms in each analyzed sample. DESeq (1) was used to normalize the numbers of reads and identify significantly differentially expressed transcripts. EdgeR (9) was also used as an alternative method to identify differentially expressed genes, and genes identified as significantly differentially expressed by both packages were retained for further analysis. The results of our DESeq comparisons are presented below.\nA principle component analysis (PCA) of expression profiles between experimental repeats revealed separate clustering between ground-control and microgravity-exposed samples, suggesting that there is more variation in expression profiles between environmental conditions than there is between repeats within a condition. Furthermore, ground-control root samples grouped more tightly in a sub-region of the PCA graph than those from microgravity-exposed root samples, suggesting a larger variation in expression profiles between repeats of the microgravity-exposed root samples relative to the ground controls.\nAnalysis of differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control seedlings identified 661 and 267 up-regulated genes in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively, relative to ground controls. Additionally, 1015 and 505 genes were found to be down-regulated in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively. A Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of these differentially expressed genes revealed an over-representation of genes potentially involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species and radiation, amongst other things.\nEven though many genes ended up being differentially expressed between microgravity and ground control samples, most were organ-specific. This is consistent with similar observations made with Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (5; 7). In fact, only 90 of the significantly differentially expressed genes are shared between roots and shoots. Of these, 35 are up-regulated and 30 down-regulated in both roots and shoots under microgravity. These genes constitute excellent candidates for a contribution to plant adaptive response to the microgravity environment of ISS. The remaining genes display opposite responses between shoots and roots. Several investigations of Arabidopsis seedling adaptation to spaceflight have also uncovered evidence of transcriptional responses involving genes that contribute to environmental and oxidative stress responses, as well as responses to reactive oxygen species (2-4; 6-8). On the other hand, our observation of enhanced expression of genes involved in radiation response under microgravity on ISS is particularly interesting considering the risks of exposure to cosmic radiations encountered by living organisms during spaceflight.\nA limited number of Brachypodium distachyon genes found to respond to the microgravity environment of ISS also respond to GS and/or MS on the ground.\nBecause Brachypodium distachyon seedling-organ responses to GS had not been previously characterized, we carried out a second ground-control experiment in this project, aimed at identifying genes whose expression is significantly altered in response to GS and/or MS. We germinated and grew Brachypodium Bd21-accession seeds in APEX Growth Chambers, within a VEGGIE growth unit at KSC under conditions that were programmed to mimic those recorded on ISS during the spaceflight experiment. After 4 days of growth, the APEX growth units were either gravity-stimulated by 180° reorientation, mechano-stimulated by 360° rotation, or not stimulated (control), and the seedlings were allowed to grow in their new orientation for an additional 5 min. Each treatment involved four repeats (four APEX Growth units). After stimulation, the seedlings were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (7/19/2018), then frozen at -80°C after 1 day at room temperature. These samples were returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and dissected to separate shoot and root tissues. RNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed (activated or repressed) in response to GS or MS. Similar sequence-analysis packages were used as those described above for RNASeq analysis of Brachypodium organ responses to microgravity.\nThis analysis revealed only small numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes between GS-/MS-induced samples and ground controls. It is, however, particularly compelling to note that 10 genes were found to be differentially expressed in response to both GS and microgravity exposure in roots. Six of these genes were repressed upon GS and activated upon exposure to microgravity, whereas the other four genes were activated in response to GS and repressed by exposure to microgravity. Therefore, these 10 genes constitute strong candidates for a contribution to gravity response in roots. They will be subjected to functional characterization.\nEqually interesting is another list of 10 genes that are transcriptionally responsive to both MS and microgravity exposure. Of these, eight were found to be down-regulated in response to MS and up-regulated upon exposure to microgravity, one was up-regulated in response to MS and down-regulated in response to microgravity, and the last one was found to be up-regulated in response to both treatments. One of these genes was also found in the list of 10 genes that are responsive to both GS and microgravity exposure. Overall, the latter group of 10 genes jointly regulated by MS and microgravity exposure are likely to contribute to plant responses to their mechanical environment. They will also be prioritized for further functional characterization.\nIn conclusion, we note that a vast majority of the genes found to be differentially expressed upon GS or MS on the ground are not transcriptionally responsive to the microgravity conditions experienced on ISS, suggesting that Brachypodium seedling organs interpret the microgravity environment of ISS very differently from GS and/or MS on the ground. This observation holds true for both shoot and root samples. It is compatible with similar observations made by others using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model (2-4; 6-8). A manuscript describing this work is in preparation.\nUsing a Genome-Wide Association Study approach to identify loci that contribute to root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior in Brachypodium distachyon seedlings\nIn addition to the APEX-06 experiment described above, we have also completed our comparative analysis of root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior on agar surfaces for 46 distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions, using time lapse-analysis of root-growth behavior coupled with automated computer-driven biometric analysis of imaged roots. Our quantitative analysis of root growth behavior included determinations of root growth rates, root tip angles from the vertical, and elemental curvatures along the roots.\nWhen growing on vertical plates, Brachypodium roots from most accessions grow straight down, as dictated by gravitropism. However, while doing so, the root-tip also tends to curve leftward and rightward of the vertical. The tip curvatures associated with these oscillations typically disappear as the differentially elongated cells migrate from the distal side of the elongation zone to more proximal regions, an auto-straightening process that is reminiscent of proprioception in animal systems. Upon 90-degree reorientation within the gravity field (gravity stimulation), the roots initiate a phase of rapid downward bending, which is followed by a second, slower phase of curvature response that is accompanied by root-tip oscillations similar to those preceding the gravity stimulus. Distinct Brachypodium accessions differ from each other in the frequency and amplitude of their root tip oscillations, as well as in the bending rate following gravity stimulation.\nTo better capture the genetic basis of variation between accessions for these traits, we developed a mathematical model that recapitulates the evolution of root tip angles from the vertical before, during and after gravity stimulation. When applied to the 46 accessions under investigation, this model is very effective at recapitulating accession-specific growth behaviors, with best-fit curves correlating well with the observed data (R-square larger than 0.9). These best-fit equations, along with Fast Fourier Transform analysis, allowed estimation of descriptive parameters for these behaviors, including root growth rate, rapid bending rates during phase 1 of gravitropism, and frequency and amplitude of oscillations.\nBecause each one of these 46 accessions had previously been subjected to genome sequencing, we were able to use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with these parameters. This analysis allowed us to identify linked loci whose contribution to oscillatory root growth behavior are being investigated using a combination of expression analysis, reverse genetics and cell biology approaches. A paper describing this research is also being prepared for publication.\nBroader Impact of Our Work\nOverall, these studies may impact our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of coordinated cell expansion and its roles in growth regulation, plant morphogenesis and plant organs' growth responses and adaptation to gravity and/or microgravity. In the longer term, our studies may enable us to engineer plants that are better suited to function as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space exploration missions, or more simply for effective growth and productivity in natural and/or agricultural ecosystems on Earth.\nNew Technology Development: The foam-based vessel (APEX Growth Chamber) we developed in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the KSC Flight Support Team has been submitted to NASA Technology Transfer System (KSC-14282).\nCited Literature\n1.

This system is based on an Oasis foam-based growth device previously used by Dr. Howard Levine to grow plants in space (NASA Space Biology Program).  Our units were designed in a collaborative effort involving Dr. Levine and the NASA Flight Support Team. With this system, seeds are inserted pre-flight into a dry block of foam, which is mounted on a medium injection device within a Magenta box. The seeds are kept in a dormant dry state, unable to germinate during spaceflight to the ISS. When the experiment is ready for initiation on ISS, an astronaut can easily inject liquid growth medium into the foam support through the injection device, thereby imbibing the seeds and triggering their germination under red light.\nThe flight experiment and corresponding ground control were carried out in March 2018 (APEX-06 mission). These experiments involved a total of 15 APEX Growth Units per condition, including 12 for each experiment and 3 spare ones. Three distinct accessions of Brachypodium distachyon were used, including Bd21 (whose genome serves as a reference for Brachypodium), BD21-3 (which has been optimized for use in transformation experiments), and Gaz-8 (which displays different root growth behaviors relative to Bd21 and Bd21-3 when grown on the ground). Four chambers (biological repeats) per accession were tested under microgravity conditions on ISS, and another four were exposed to 1-g on the ground under conditions that mimicked the flight experiment (ground control).\nAs previously reported, this material was prepared for flight to the ISS on March 27-30, 2018, and launched on SpaceX-14 on April 2, 2018. Upon transferring the 12 seeded APEX growth chambers from stowage into the ISS, astronaut Scott Tingle activated the experiment by injecting growth medium into the units on April 12, 2018.  Seeds were allowed to germinate in the presence of red light for 24 hours, then blue and green lights were turned on and the plants were allowed to grow for three more days. At the end of this growth period, astronaut Tingle collected each APEX growth unit, took photographs of each face, harvested the seedlings, and placed them into KFT for fixation in the presence of RNAlater. For each APEX Growth Unit, a few seedlings displayed roots that grew away from the foam surface and showed evidence of stress. These seedlings were harvested separately from those whose root tips were still contacting the block surface at harvesting time. Fixation in RNAlater was carried out at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The KFTs were then transferred to a cold storage device (-80°C) and returned to the ground on the Dragon capsule.\nThe environmental conditions experienced by the plants during their growth period in VEGGIE on ISS were recorded, and then recapitulated in plant growth units at KSC during a first ground-based control. At the end of this experiment, the seedlings were also fixed in RNAlater. After similar storage under -80°C conditions, the samples were returned to the Principal Investigator (PI) laboratory, as were the pictures of seedlings grown under both microgravity and 1-g conditions. As reported last year, seedlings grown under microgravity displayed significant root-growth inhibition compared to ground controls for all accessions tested. The shoots of microgravity-grown Bd21 seedlings were also shorter than ground control, but those of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 were similar under both gravity conditions. We conclude that distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display distinct adaptive responses to the microgravity environment encountered on ISS. In addition to accession-specific slight alterations of organs growth, we also observed that the primary roots of microgravity-grown seedlings displayed longer root hairs than those of ground-control samples.\nTo better understand the mechanisms that contribute to Brachypodium seedlings adaptation to the microgravity environment of ISS, root and shoot tissues were dissected from frozen fixed Bd21 seedlings that had been exposed to the microgravity environment on ISS as well as ground-control material. Total RNAs were extracted from these tissues and used to build TruSeq Stranded Total RNA libraries, which were sequenced in a Novaseq sequencer programmed to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. Library sequencing generated an average of 25 to 30 million reads per sample. Sequence analysis involved a pipeline that included FastQC to control for the quality of sequence reads and filter out poor reads, Tophat2 to align each reads to the reference Brachypodium genome, Bowtie2 to build an index, HTseq to count the number of reads assigned to each annotated gene/transcript, and DEseq (R package) to evaluate differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control samples.\nA principle component analysis (PCA) of expression profiles between experimental repeats revealed separate clustering between ground-control and microgravity-exposed samples, suggesting that there is more variation in expression profiles between environmental conditions than there is between repeats within a condition. Furthermore, ground-control root samples grouped more tightly in a sub-region of the PCA graph than those from microgravity-exposed root samples, suggesting a larger variation in expression profiles exists between repeats of the microgravity-exposed root samples relative to the ground controls.\nInitial analysis of differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control seedlings identified 398 and 159 significantly up-regulated genes in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively, relative to ground controls. Additionally, 867 and 380 significantly down-regulated genes were found in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively. A Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of these differentially expressed genes revealed an over-representation of genes potentially involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli and oxidative stress, amongst other things.\nBecause the Brachypodium distachyon seedling organ responses to gravity stimulation have not been well characterized, we also carried out a second control experiment in this project, aimed at identifying genes whose expression is significantly altered in response to gravity- and/or mechano-stimulation.  As reported last year, we germinated and grew Bd21 seeds in APEX Growth Chambers, within a VEGGIE unit, under growth conditions that were programmed to mimic those recorded on ISS during the spaceflight experiment. After four days of growth, the APEX growth units were either gravity-stimulated by 180° reorientation, mechano-stimulated by 360° rotation, or unstimulated (control), and the seedlings were allowed to grow in their new position for five minutes. Each stimulus involved four repeats (four APEX Growth units). After 5-min incubations, the seedlings were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (7/19/2018), then frozen at -80°C after one day of fixation. These samples were returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where each sample was dissected to separate shoot and root tissues. RNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed between treatments. Currently, the analytical pipeline described above is being used to analyze the RNAseq profiles and identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed (activated or repressed) in response to mechano- or gravity-stimulation. The groups of genes found to be differentially expressed under microgravity on ISS will be compared to those that are differentially expressed in response to gravity- or mechano-stimulation under 1-g. Reverse genetics will then be used to investigate the contribution of these genes to plant responses to microgravity, gravity- or mechano-stimulation.\nIn addition to the APEX-06 experiment described above, we have also completed our comparative analysis of root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior on agar surfaces for 45 distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions, using time lapse-analysis of root growth behavior coupled with automated computer-driven biometric analysis of imaged roots. Our quantitative analysis of root growth behavior included determinations of root growth rates, root tip angles from the vertical, and elemental curvatures along the roots.\nWhen growing on vertical plates, Brachypodium roots from most accessions grow straight down, as dictated by gravitropism. However, while doing so, the root-tip also tends to curve leftward and rightward of the vertical. The tip curvatures associated with these oscillations typically disappear as the differentially elongated cells migrate from the distal side of the elongation zone to more proximal regions, an auto-straightening process that is reminiscent of proprioception in animal systems. Upon 90-degree reorientation within the gravity field (gravity stimulation), the roots initiate a phase of rapid downward bending, which is followed by a second, slower phase of curvature response that is accompanied by root-tip oscillations similar to those preceding the gravity stimulus. Distinct Brachypodium accessions differ from each other in the frequency and amplitude of their root tip oscillations, as well as in the bending rate following gravity stimulation.\nTo better capture the genetic basis of variation between accessions for these traits, we developed a mathematical model that recapitulates the evolution of root tip angles from the vertical before, during, and after gravity stimulation. When applied to the 45 accessions under investigation, this model was very effective at recapitulating accession-specific growth behaviors, with best-fit curves correlating well with the observed data (R-square larger than 0.9).  These best-fit equations, along with Fast Fourier Transform analysis, allowed estimation of descriptive parameters for these behaviors, including root growth rate, rapid bending rates during phase 1 of gravitropism, and frequency and amplitude of oscillations.\nBecause each one of these 45 accessions had previously been subjected to genome sequencing, we were able to use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with these parameters. SNPs showing significant probabilities of association with several growth parameters including the maximal rate of rapid bending and the amplitude of oscillations, have been identified and are being characterized. Overall, these studies have allowed us to identify linked loci whose contribution to oscillatory root growth behavior are being investigated using a combination of expression analysis, reverse genetics and cell biology approaches.\nOverall, these studies may impact our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of coordinated cell expansion and its roles in growth regulation, plant morphogenesis, and plant organs' growth responses and adaptation to gravity and/or microgravity. In the longer term, our studies may enable us to engineer plants that are better suited to function as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space exploration missions, or more simply for effective growth and productivity in natural and/or agricultural ecosystems on Earth.",

            "task_description": "This research has capitalized on the capabilities of the VEGGIE hardware to address how spaceflight affects plant gene expression and growth related to low oxygen stress (hypoxia). Hypoxia is thought to develop in spaceflight as weightlessness nullifies the buoyancy-driven convection that usually aids in mixing and supplying gas (oxygen) around organisms. Our analysis of Arabidopsis grown on the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the BRIC17 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiment is consistent with the plants grown in space having experienced long-term hypoxic stress. These plants also showed hallmarks of up-regulating Ca2+- and reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) pathways (such as those supported by the enzyme RBOHD). Further, we have identified a Ca2+ transporter named CAX2 as playing a critical role in this hypoxic signaling system. We therefore have used the plant growth capabilities of the VEGGIE to significantly extend our insights into hypoxic stress. Wild-type, rbohD, and cax2 mutant seedlings were grown on orbit. After 8 days, samples were photographed, fixed in RNAlater using Kennedy Fixation Tubes, and frozen for subsequent post-flight analysis. For analysis, we have quantified patterns of growth and gene expression using the techniques of RNAseq and qPCR. In addition, analysis of a ROS reporter gene tagged with green fluorescent protein has been made using fluorescence microscopy. Comparison to plants grown on the ground help define how much of the responses seen on orbit can be explained by the development of long-term hypoxia linked to the microgravity environment. Results from this analysis are expected to advance our understanding of hypoxic response in plants grown in both space and on Earth in addition to testing whether the hypoxic Ca2+ signaling system provides targets for genetically engineering potential countermeasures to low oxygen stress.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research has addressed how spaceflight may induce stresses related to reduced oxygen availability in plants. The work has targeted the role of Ca2+ signaling and reactive oxygen species as components of this response to define molecular components of the system. The results from this work will both provide insight into a potentially important element of spaceflight-related stress and also help to define elements of the low oxygen response system that operates on Earth. Plants on Earth experience such conditions during flooding of the soil, when there is a large microbial population in the soil consuming available oxygen and even when the metabolic activities within the plant's own tissues are intense enough to consume available oxygen. These natural low oxygen events are sensed by plants and can lead to either changes in growth and development to accommodate or escape them, or in extreme cases they can lead to significant losses in productivity and even death. These spaceflight experiments on low oxygen sensing mechanisms will therefore help provide molecular targets for potential manipulation to help make plants more tolerant of low oxygen and so contribute to agronomically important traits such as flooding tolerance in crop plants."

            "task_progress": "APEX-05 mission and sample analyses: APEX05 successfully launched on SpaceX-13. Plants were grown on orbit in the Veggie hardware, were returned frozen, and gene expression analysis using RNAseq also successfully completed. The experimental plants grew for 8 days on orbit and showed the expected levels of vigorous development, comparable to the parallel ground controls. All flight success criteria and subsequent sample analyses were in the excellent range.\nThe overarching hypothesis for the APEX05 experimental design is that spaceflight imposes hypoxic and oxidative stress that will be disrupted in the cax2 and atrbohd mutants and that this will be reflected in the patterns of gene expression from plants growing on orbit. This idea is supported by direct analysis of various Arabidopsis ecotypes grown on the ISS and by comparison of the transcriptional responses from multiple plant spaceflight experiments analyzed using the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database, which aggregates much of the available data in this area. Comparison of gene expression patterns in flight vs ground samples for APEX-05 indicate these ideas are likely correct. The wild type control plants showed patterns of gene expression consistent with both hypoxia and oxidative stress as well as reduction in both root and shoot growth when compared to ground controls.\nAPEX-05 cax2 responses: The hypoxia resistant cax2 mutants showed reduced induction of hypoxia-related transcripts in spaceflight. Consistent with these observations, the cax2 mutants also showed high basal expression of several molecular markers of hypoxic response, suggesting they were constitutively adapted to hypoxia, even when O2 levels were normal. Further, in ground-based controls on Earth showed these mutants were resistant to hypoxia and to flooding stress (another low oxygen environment), again consistent with a constant hypoxia response pre-adapting them to this stress. CAX2 is a Ca2+ pump that should attenuate the Ca2+ signaling triggered by low oxygen levels and the cax2 mutants showed elevated basal Ca2+ levels and significantly higher hypoxia-induced Ca2+ signals, providing a potential mechanism for their constitutive and enhanced low O2 stress resilience.\nAPEX-05 rbohd responses: The wild-type plants in space also showed evidence of the induction of genes responsive to oxidative stress, such as a suite of molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein family. These genes were not induced in the rbohD mutant, which maintained growth in spaceflight above levels of the wild type control plants. In ground controls, the rbohd mutants also showed resistance to hypoxic and flooding stresses, suggesting hypoxia and ROS signaling may be intimately interrelated in spaceflight responses.\nGround-based analyses: As part of these studies a series of ground-based analyses have been conducted to help either develop assays for the spaceflight experiments, or to better define the Ca2+ and ROS-based signaling in plants likely triggered by spaceflight. An improved red-light based system to impose dormancy on Arabidopsis seeds to aid in their transfer to orbit for APEX-05 has been developed and a collaboration with the Townsend group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has led to production of a hyperspectral imaging system to investigate how this technology might be applied to monitoring plant stress in growth chamber environments such as the Veggie hardware used for APEX-05. During analyses of signaling events, a new plant-wide ROS and Ca2+ signaling system based on propagating waves of Ca2+ has been revealed. Additionally, a new transcriptional reporter for monitoring the dynamics of ROS-imposed stress throughout the plant has been developed.\nPresentations and Outreach/Education: The APEX-05 project has been presented at numerous national and international meetings including regularly at the Plant Cell Dynamics Meeting, the ISS Research and Development Conference, the annual meetings of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, and the American Society of Plant Biology, and at university venues ranging from South Dakota State to the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. APEX-05 has also been central to a series of outreach activities, being regularly presented at events ranging from University of Wisconsin sponsored outreach days (e.g., University of Wisconsin’s Science Expeditions) to presentations for high school students, undergraduates, and middle school and K-12 teachers (such as regularly at the BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute summer training program for teachers). APEX-05 has also been featured in some unique mentoring opportunities such as to multiple groups participating in the plant space biology themed First Lego League Championship over 2018-2019. Multiple cohorts of undergraduates have also participated in designing and fabricating hardware such as the red-light dormancy inducing system used in the APEX-05 flight or clinostats and low O2 chambers used in the ground-based controls for the APEX-05 experimentation.",

The proposed ISS-MO establishment will lead to long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics, addressing recommendation P1 of this solicitation. It will also provide answers to NASA Space Biology Guiding Questions CMM-1, CMM-4, and CMM-5.\nThe ISS-MO project's methodology will serve as the foundation for an extensive microbial census, offering significant insight into spaceflight-induced changes in the populations of beneficial and potentially harmful microbes. Additionally, it will provide NASA with both a mechanistic understanding of these changes (e.g., cataloging population changes and mapping/linking these to environmental niche and genomic changes), as well as insight into practical countermeasures for mitigating risks to humans and environmental systems.\nThe ISS-MO team will use existing ISS sample collection technologies to generate an initial microbial census. Following their return to Earth, samples from the various ISS modules will be analyzed using standardized technologies from the Mars Program-funded projects.\nThe proposed ISS-MO project includes the delivery of a database that compiles the genomic sequences and genetic information for all the microbes encountered within the ISS habitat. Using this data, NASA can more accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to providing microbial profiles, the ISS-MO team will identify which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health.

The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo and crew, that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity.

Several defined locations were systematically collected from 3 consecutive flights and microbial census was generated using advanced molecular microbial community analysis “omics” techniques, supported by traditional culture-based methods. Similarly, an Inflated Lunar/Mars Analog Habitat as a ground control system and SpaceX CRS (Commercial Resupply Service) vehicles to trace source of any possible contamination were examined and results presented. The 3-year funded 5 year time period of the MT-1 experiments was completed and the information produced would serve as the foundation for an extensive microbial census, offering significant insight into spaceflight-induced changes in the populations of beneficial and potentially harmful microbes. The safety of crewmembers and the maintenance of hardware are the primary goals for monitoring microorganisms in this closed habitat.\nThis study provides the first comprehensive catalogue of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries. The outcomes of the MT-1 microbiome study presented here may enable the development of suitable countermeasure technologies allowing to eradicate problematic microorganisms for human habitation in space and in confined built environments on Earth (e.g., medical, pharmaceutical, and spacecraft cleanrooms).

            "task_description": "One of the main concerns for long-term deep manned space missions are health risks associated with altered gravitational environment and prolonged exposure to low-dose radiation above levels normally found on Earth. Microgravity and radiation exposure have been known to produce a number of neurological disturbances and neurodegeneration by space flight condition. However, the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the brain vasculature and the underlying mechanism(s) of these disturbances are less studied and remain unclear.\nOur proposal seeks to fill in the gap by testing the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase is a critical source of the neurovascular oxidative stress following space flight conditions that mediates vascular remodeling in the brain, thus disrupting communication between endothelial cells and astrocytes and altering production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It is further proposed that these changes will contribute to increased vascular permeability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disturbance, thus resulting in neurological deficit.\nOur specific aims are 1) Define the causal relationships between space flight condition induced NADPH oxidase expression, vascular damage, and BBB function following microgravity and/or low-dose irradiation in mature mice using neuropathology, stereological, and automated image analysis, and neurobehavioral outcomes. 2) Determine if space flight condition-induced oxidative stress is mediated through NADPH oxidase in brain microvasculature.\nNox2 (a subunit of NADPH oxidase) gene knockout (Nox2(-/-)) mice, and  wild-type (Nox2(+/+))  C57BL/6 mice  will be used in this ground-based animal study. Hindlimb unloading (HLU) will be used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component.  Low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma-irradiation (0.5 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) will be delivered to the whole-body of mature adult mice to simulate the radiation component for over 21 days while the animals are tail-unloaded in cages for microgravity simulation.  We will evaluate the radiation- and microgravity-induced brain vascular and tissue remodeling at multiple time points (1 day to 12 months post-irradiation).\nTogether, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced imaging techniques, stereological analysis, and behavioral tests will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of space flight condition-induced oxidative damage on brain tissue and vascular remodeling.

There are strong indications that the physiological effects of space flight are similar to those seen in some neurodegenerative diseases and aging: multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease. Our study will provide the first detailed description of combined effects of microgravity and LDR radiation on oxidative stress-induced brain tissue and microvessel network remodeling and underlying mechanism(s) of potential interaction of space flight environmental components over a 12-month observation period. Our research will provide important input to elucidate cellular pathways of response and adaptation to stress imposed by environmental conditions in the brain vasculature. Understanding how factors and environmental insults impact on vasculature and tissue remodeling and function will increase our knowledge and help focus the approach toward more effective countermeasures during human space flight and planetary exploration.

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORTING SEPTEMBER 2019\nAll the experiments and data analysis have been completed as planned.  So far, we have finished four batches of wild-type (WT) animal studies for specific aim 1, at 7 days, 1, 3, and 9 month time points and Nox2 knockout mice study as proposed in specific aims 1 and 2.  We have examined protein markers associated with the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis in the brain using immunostaining, metabolic response using metabolic biochemical assays, hematological parameters, and behavioral responses after combined exposure to simulated microgravity and low-dose radiation. Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers which may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These results have been published in four peer reviewed journals: Radiation Research, Nature npj Microgravity, PLOS One.\nWe have received supplement funding in October, 2017 to use\"omics\"-based molecular phenotyping approach for identification and characterization of genomic signatures in eye and brain associated with low-dose radiation and simulated microgravity at 1-and 4- month time points. Omics analyses were performed for full genome transcriptomics including RNA-Seq HT Ribo-depletion library preps and RNA spike-control. DNA methylation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS).  The dataset has been submitted to NASA GeneLab site, through NASA IT system. One manuscript titled:  Mice Exposed to Combined Chronic Low-Dose Irradiation and Modeled Microgravity Develop Long-Term Neurological Sequelae has been published in International Journal of Medical Sciences (IJMS) to evaluate simulated radiation and microgravity induced changes in the brain related to cellular structure, oxidative stress, immune response, and metabolic function.\nANNUAL REPORTING SEPTEMBER 2018: The purpose of this study was to determine whether nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-derived stress can account for unloading- and radiation-induced endothelial damage and neurovascular remodeling in a mouse model. Wild-type (WT, Nox2 (+/+)) C57BL/6 mice or Nox2 (-/-) (B6. 129S6-CYBBM) knockout (KO) mice were placed into one of the following groups: age-matched control, hindlimb unloading (HLU), low-dose/low-dose-rate radiation (LDR), or HLU+LDR simultaneously for 21 days, and were then sacrificed 1 month later. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of microgravity. The LDR was delivered using 57Co plates (0.04Gy at 0.01cGy/h) to the whole body in order to simulate the radiation experienced while in space.  Brains were isolated for characterization of various oxidative stress markers and vascular topology.\nWe received supplement funding in October, 2017 to use  “omics”-based molecular phenotyping approach for identification and characterization of genomic signatures in eye and brain associated with low-dose radiation and simulated microgravity  at 1- and 4– month time points. Omics analyses performed were\n•\t RNAseq for full genome transcriptomics including RNA-Seq HT Ribo-depletion library preps and RNA spike-control.\n•\tDNA methylation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS).\nThe assay has completed and dataset are in the process of submitting to NASA GeneLab site, through NASA IT system. Many canonical pathways were significantly activated/inhibited in the brain after HLU, LDgammaR, or the combination of both. Most robust changes are observed in LDgammaR + HLU group compared to control. At 1 months, the combination group induced significant activations of EIF2 phosphorylation signaling pathway in the brain, responsible for chronic neurodegeneration. Cellular immune response pathways including leukocyte extravasation signaling, as well as pathways responsible for cell growth, cell repair, and metabolic stress were also significantly altered compared to controls.  The mRNA expression for many genes regulating oxidative stress (e.g., GNRH1, UCN3), extracellular matrix remodeling (e.g., Cldn3, FBLN1), endothelial cell biology (e.g., AQP1), and cognitive function (e.g., OXT, AVP) were significantly changed (p<0.05) after HLU+ LDgammaR compared to control.  Gene analysis  of retina tissues also showed that many key pathways responsible for photoreceptor function, oxidative stress, and metabolic function were significantly different between LDgammaR + HLU and control (p<0.05).",

            "task_description": "Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the \"spaceflight syndrome\") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.\nCentral Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.\nSpecific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:\nA. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.\nB. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or \"RNA-Seq\") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance.\nThis report documents the activities related to “Global transcriptome profiling to identify cellular stress mechanisms responsible for spaceflight-induced antibiotic resistance”. The original grant was to perform the spaceflight experiment “Biological Research in Canisters #21 (BRIC-21), with the aim of understanding how bacterial cells perceive and respond to the human spaceflight environment. We have successfully completed all the original aims and goals of this grant proposal.\nNew Objective:  \tIn 2019, this grant was tasked with a new objective: to develop and test in spaceflight a new sample compartment for use in BRIC-PDFU and/or BRIC-LED hardware. In all previous BRIC experiments, the sample compartment consisted of the bottom half of a standard 60-mm Petri dish. However, during the BRIC-21 experiment we noted that liquid cultures assumed a toroidal shape in spaceflight (FL), in contrast to the disk-shaped ground control (GC) samples. It was hypothesized that this difference in culture geometry might account in part for the measured differences in the transcriptomic responses between FL and GC samples (Morrison, M.D., P. Fajardo-Cavazos, and W.L. Nicholson. 2019. Comparison of Bacillus subtilis transcriptome profiles from two separate missions to the International Space Station. npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0).  \tIn collaboration with the laboratories of Drs. Mark Weislogel and Titel Jurca, we have conceived and built a new sample compartment designed to mitigate the effects of microgravity on liquid culture geometry in petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Drop-tower and biocompatibility testing of a prototype device was in progress when our labs were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which essentially halted all progress on the project for several months. During the past year (10/01/2020 to 09/30/2021), we have resumed laboratory operations and have completed testing of the new modified Petri dish insert. It is now ready for utilization in spaceflight.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Exposure of microorganisms to spaceflight provokes a variety of stress responses, some of which have been postulated to lead to increased antibiotic resistance. The central goal of this proposal is to identify these stress responses, using high-throughput global transcriptome and phenotypic analyses.

            "task_progress": "The major factor influencing the behavior of microbes growing in liquids in space is microgravity. We recently measured the transcriptomic response of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis to the microgravity environment inside the ISS in spaceflight hardware called Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs). In two separate experiments in the ISS, dubbed BRIC-21 and BRIC-23, we grew multiple replicates of the same B. subtilis strain in the same hardware, growth medium, and temperature with matching ground control samples (npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0). [Ed. Note: See Cumulative Bibliography listing.] In both experiments, we observed similar responses of the transcriptome to spaceflight. However, we also noted that the liquid cultures assumed a different configuration in microgravity (a toroidal shape) compared with the ground control samples (a flat disk shape), leading us to question whether the transcriptome differences we observed were a direct result of microgravity, or a secondary result of the different liquid geometries of the samples affecting, for example, oxygen availability.\nTo mitigate the influence of microgravity on liquid geometry in BRIC canisters, we have designed an insert to replace the standard 60-mm Petri dish in BRIC-PDFU or BRIC-LED sample compartments. In this design, liquid cultures are expected to assume a more disk-like configuration regardless of gravity or its absence. We have: (i) constructed a prototype device by 3D printing; (ii) evaluated different starting materials, treatments, and coatings for their wettability (i.e., hydrophilicity) using contact angle measurements; (iii) confirmed that the device performs as designed by drop-tower testing and; (iv) performed material biocompatibility studies using liquid cultures of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Future microgravity testing of the device in the ISS is planned.",

            "task_description": "The amount of bone loss between individual astronauts is highly variable with some astronauts losing large amounts of bone while others are largely unaffected. This variability is accounted for, at least to a large extent, by genetic variations between individuals. Unfortunately, the specific genes that modulate this genetic sensitivity of bone loss in microgravity are unknown.  To this end, we have recently completed a genetic study in which we identified specific regions on chromosomes (QTL or Quantitative Trait Loci) that either add to or reduce the propensity of an individual to lose bone when normal weightbearing is removed from the musculoskeleton. While providing critical information, these QTL still contain hundreds of genes, rather than a single one. Here, we propose first to greatly reduce the number of candidate genes with bioinformatics tools and then experimentally test the shortlist of candidate genes using knockout mice available from the Jackson Laboratory’s (JAX) Genetic Resource Repository and the JAX Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP) production center. The identification of single genes modulating bone loss during weightlessness can be used as a critical diagnostic tool for the identification of astronauts most in need of countermeasures as well as to unravel novel drug targets that preserve bone health in space.",

NASA indicated that a total of 20 mice were planned to be flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and 40 mice would serve as ground controls.  Four immunization treatment groups were part of the experimental protocol that was designed to assess the in vivo antibody responses during spaceflight.  In particular, the antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each of the treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatments.  Our group (Pecaut and Chapes) proposed to collect mouse liver, bone marrow, kidney/adrenal glands, and thymus to accomplish two specific aims.\n1.  Specific Aim 1:  Collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  These tissues would have been used to assess short- and long-term stress to the flight animals.\n2.  Specific Aim 2:  Collect liver and bone marrow.   These tissues would be used for the preparation of RNA to allow for a comparative analysis of B cell IgH usage between lymphoid compartments.\nWith the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and > or = 2 year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved to modify the aims of NNX15AB45G as follows:\n1.  Obtain liver tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research 1 (RR1) verification flight.  Preflight verification tests done as part of NNX15AB45G have shown that usable RNA cannot be obtained from bone marrow from frozen carcasses (using the freezing procedure currently used on ISS).  Therefore, we proposed to focus on liver tissue.  Liver RNA was available from the liver tissue (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 AEM ground controls).  We proposed to do MiSeq next generation sequencing on a group of flight and ground samples.  In addition, NASA GeneLab had done HiSeq next generation sequencing on some of the liver tissue flown on RR1.  We proposed to obtain those data. We proposed to determine IgH usage of the liver B cells in the mice (flight vs. ground controls).  One of our goals is to determine if there is tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.\n2.  An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) was proposed to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight (This experiment will be done as part of NNX13AN34G).  In this protocol, mice will be subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice will be immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS, CpG only, tetanus toxoid (TT) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections will be intraperitoneal (i.p.). Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we will obtain liver tissue from those mice.  We will directly assess the changes in IgH usage caused by immunization ± adjuvant (CpG) and will address the impact of skeletal unloading. One of our original goals was to examine the impact of spaceflight on host B cell responsiveness in different tissue compartments.  Therefore, this experiment was expected to partially fulfill the goals of Aim 1 of the original grant by using AOS as a spaceflight model.  We proposed to  compare the impact of skeletal unloading using AOS on host responsiveness to antigen challenge and address the issue of tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.       In addition to the IgH usage studies, we proposed to collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  The data obtained from these tissue analyses will be used to assess short- and long-term stress to AOS animals.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Spaceflight offers a unique environment that impacts many physiological systems. This occurs not only in humans but also in rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.  Among these systems, bone and the immune response are connected and are known to be significantly altered by the skeletal unloading of spaceflight.  B lymphocytes are one of the cells that develop in the bone marrow.  They make antibodies in response to infection or immunization with vaccines.  Moreover, the B cells that protect people from disease after receiving immunizations localize to the bone marrow as well as other lymphoid organs.  We will obtain valuable information about what changes occur in the B-cell populations that develop in lymphoid organs such as liver and compare the development of these B-cell populations found in other lymphoid compartments.  This understanding will tell us if more precautions are necessary on Earth when people are skeletally unloaded.  On Earth, skeletal unloading occurs to individuals that are bedridden for long periods of time, wheel-chair bound, or lose the ability to stand for long periods of time.  Therefore, the space environment provides an accelerated view of what will happen to individuals that must endure these prolonged periods of skeletal unloading.   This experiment will have direct relevance to individuals on Earth."

Therefore, we sequenced both splenic (funded by another grant) and liver RNA from the Rodent Research 1 (RR1) validation flight, which was made available by the NASA Ames Research Center (n=3 ground, n=3 flight). RNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (275bp, 2x) at the Kansas State Integrated Genomics Facility. Sequencing data was quality trimmed using CLC genomics workbench and mapped to reference libraries obtained from ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database. Datasets were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for CDR3 characterization.\nThe analysis of liver vs. spleen reads indicated that liver immunoglobulin gene reads range from 0.26% of spleen immunoglobulin gene reads to 0.91%.  The number of reads ranges from less than 100 to no greater than 622, depending on the sample.  Although useful, publishable data from the spleen was obtained (data presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, Poster #120, and presented in the GeneLab workshop by Chapes and Ward) and the liver sequencing did not provide much usable meaningful immunoglobulin gene data, even when the more comprehensive MiSeq next generation sequencing platform is used to sequence.  The liver data that we did obtain was published in our publication on the RR1 flight (Life Sciences in Space Research, 2018--See Bibliography section below).  Other data from the MiSeq NGS data sets will be useful for other data mining attempts and was made available to the GeneLab.  Therefore, these sequencing runs will provide a rich data source.\nAssessment of the bone marrow B-cell repertoire\nBecause our specific aim to examine the liver for IgH V, D, and J gene segment usage and IgL for V and J gene segment was not successful, we received permission to assess bone marrow.  Bone marrow is an important, essential immune compartment for the storage of B cell plasma and memory cells (Erickson, Lin et al. 2003; Cariappa, Chase et al. 2007).  Although preflight verification tests indicated that sequence quality RNA could not be obtained from bone marrow from frozen carcasses (using the freezing procedure currently used on ISS), usable, bone marrow RNA was obtained from the mice used in the AOS experiment.\nWe used skeletal unloading with the antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) model to simulate some of the physiological effects associated with spaceflight. Loaded and unloaded animals were challenged with tetanus toxoid (TT) and/or CpG, an adjuvant.  Two weeks after challenge, bone marrow was collected and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq 2x300 platform. The resulting antibody repertoire was characterized, including V-, D- (heavy only), and J-gene segment usage, constant region usage, CDR3 length, and V(D)J combinations. We detected changes in gene-segment usage in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatment in both the heavy and light chains. Additionally, changes were seen in the class-switched VH-gene repertoire. Alterations were also detected in V/J pairing for both the heavy and light chains, and changes in CDR3 length. We also detected lower levels of CDR3 AA overlap than detected in the splenic repertoire. These results demonstrate that AOS, TT, and CpG altered the bone marrow antibody repertoire.\nWhen we compared the bone marrow repertoire to the spleen B cell repertoire, there appear to be some differences in the bone marrow repertoire compared to the spleen.  However, there was no evidence to suggest that AOS has a significant negative impact on the natural B cell responses or the Ig rearrangements that normally occur in response to antigen treatment in the bone marrow.  Additional spleen and bone marrow comparisons are planned in the future and some antigen specific VDJ gene combinations that are necessary for TT-specific responses will also be assessed in the future.\nA manuscript entitled “Effects of skeletal unloading on the bone marrow antibody repertoire of tetanus toxoid and/or CpG treated C57BL/6J mice” is in preparation at the time of the submission of this report and will be submitted in March 2019.\nAssessment of the mouse B-cell repertoire in normal mice flown to the ISS\nAs part of our RR1 work and specific aim 1, we utilized high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the ISS during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals; however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Ig (kappa) gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that spaceflight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.  Therefore, we successfully completed our modified specific aim one and we were able to successfully characterize immunoglobulin gene segment usage and junctional diversity within the antibody repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS.   Although individual gene segment usage remained similar among animals within and among treatment groups, with the most abundant gene segments being conserved across all animals, gene segment combinations and CDR3 sequences were highly varied, demonstrating the combinatorial diversity of the antibody repertoire, but that variation reflects the dynamics of individualized selection of Ig molecules and not any impact of spaceflight. A larger sample size would help solidify this conclusion, but these data provide preliminary suggestions that the recombinatorial processes that lead to the diverse Ig repertoires in mice are not affected by a short trip to and stay on the ISS. These data do not preclude that differences in the Ig repertoires of ground and flight animals might occur during during active immunization or in younger, possibly more recombinatorily active mice.\nWork Completed to accomplish Specific Aim 2\nCompletion of Antiorthostatic Suspension Experiment\nAn AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during spaceflight (Chapes, Mastro et al. 1993) (Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]; Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we obtained both spleen and liver tissue from those mice.  This protocol was followed so that when mice are flown to ISS in the future, we will have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables.\nUnderstanding the normal, C57BL/6J mouse B-cell repertoire\nIn preparation for the AOS, to understand the normal repertoire of the C57BL/6 mouse we studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presented a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.     Work completed for Specific Aims 1 and 2\nWe completed studies to validate methods to handle tissues from ISS, validate bioinformatics work flow, and the validation using next generation sequencing without amplification.  This work was necessary for the completion of Aims 1 and 2.\nValidation of methods to assess the immunoglobulin gene repertoire in tissues obtained from mice on the International Space Station\nNext Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools were available to assess antibody repertoires.  We could identify immunoglobulin gene-segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. However, due to limitations on the ISS, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed.   Therefore, some of our work had to validate that we could obtain usable biological material to complete our analyses.  To this end, our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. We also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Ig (kappa) variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq (data from RR1 mice from GeneLab) and MiSeq datasets, which we generated ourselves, and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and we produced a data set that provided other data mining options. We validated our workflow by comparing our normal mouse MiSeq data to existing murine antibody repertoire studies validating it for future antibody repertoire studies.\nCharacterization of the naive murine antibody repertoire using unamplified high-throughput sequencing\nSequencing of the antibody repertoire has steadily become cheaper and easier for researchers. These sequencing methods rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. In an effort to eliminate potential biases and create data sets that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs. total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission.  We determined that the use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase or primer usage had no statistical effects on read count.  Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. We also determined that although the unique CR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, it detected most of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.\nReferences\nErickson, L. D., L.-L.

            "task_description": "For most organisms the stresses associated with spaceflight induce a variety of detrimental effects. To foster a safe and productive long-term human presence in space, therapies and countermeasures to spaceflight-induced stress should be developed. Tardigrades (water bears) are polyextremophiles that have evolved to tolerate multiple extreme environments, which are restrictive to most life. In 2007 tardigrades were shown to survive and reproduce normally during an 11-day low Earth orbit on the Foton-M3 Capsule. We speculate that mechanisms tardigrades have evolved to withstand extreme environments on Earth may, as a side-effect, confer protection against the stresses of spaceflight. This makes tardigrades a uniquely valuable system for studying responses to spaceflight. We have sequenced the genome of the tardigrades Hypsibius dujardini, as well as developed and validated experimental and computational approaches for measuring the effect of different environmental conditions on tardigrade gene expression – allowing us to identify mechanisms used by tardigrades to protect themselves from different stresses. We have also developed a reverse genetic approach, RNA interference, for tardigrades that allows us to directly investigate the role of a gene in conferring tolerance to an environment. We will use these approaches to study tardigrades’ initial, as well as multigenerational, response to spaceflight and use RNA interference to test the functionality of the genes identified in our study. Next-generation transcriptome sequencing will be conducted on tardigrades cultures kept 0 generations (founding generation) and 4 generations onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Differential expression analysis will be conducted to compare ISS spaceflight timepoints, ground controls, and tardigrades exposed to other extreme stresses (e.g., desiccation, freezing). This approach will allow us to identify potential mediators of stress tolerance, which will serve as candidates for functional RNA interference experiments. Understanding how tardigrades tolerate spaceflight will better guide future research into countermeasures and therapies for humans exposed to the stresses of prolonged space travel. This proposal's strengths are: the use of an organism that is suited to studying mechanisms of multigenerational tolerance of extreme environments and that has an established RNA interference method for confirming the function of genes identified in our study, our Preliminary Results that validate our proposed approach and technical capabilities as well as the uniqueness and suitability of tardigrades that will allow us to conduct this study. The participants for this study are comprised of experts in tardigrades' stress response and have considerable experience with next-generation sequencing and analysis of non-model organisms. The proposed experiments directly address recommendation AH16 of the Decadal Survey and are in line with recommendation OCB-5 and CMM-5 of NASA’s Multigenerational and Developmental Biology of Invertebrates Research Emphasis as well as NASA’s Fundamental Space Biology Plan 2010-2020 goals. Completion of our proposal will identify genes required for tardigrades to survive multigenerational spaceflight and will be a key step towards developing countermeasures and therapies for stresses associated with prolonged human exposure to space environments.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Along with using mechanisms of stress tolerance to counteract detrimental effects of space travel, data from our proposed experiments could be used in the long term toward solving serious problems in the field of human health. Utilizing mechanisms that allow tardigrades to stabilize their cellular proteins and nucleic acids has been proposed as an option for the dry storage and stabilization of vaccines and other biomaterials (Guo et al., 2000; Wolkers et al., 2001; Puhlev et al., 2001). Because current techniques for vaccine production, distribution, and storage nearly always require a constant cold chain (e.g., -80 and 20 degrees C freezers), these processes are extremely expensive. Some estimates put cold chain costs at around 80% of the total cost of vaccination (Chen et al., 2011). By generating additional stress response datasets, such as response to microgravity, freezing, irradiation, and hypoxia, we will increase our ability and that of other researchers to identify specific mediators of desiccation tolerance, which will then be applied to this and similar problems.\nAdditionally, a better understanding of mechanisms of stress tolerance could lead to the development of drought and/or freeze tolerant crops.\nGuo, N., Puhlev, I., Brown, D.

            "task_progress": "REPORTING  FROM AUGUST 2019; PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR MOVED TO UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING IN FALL 2019 and NEW GRANT 80NSSC20K0283 AWARDED (Ed., 7/24/2020)\nThe bulk of our research on NASA Grant NNX15AB44G that was conducted at UNC (the University of North Carolina) can be broken down into two categories: 1.) ground controls and experiments, and 2.) testing and validation for our flight experiment. Below are summaries of our research in both of these categories.  Ground Controls and Experiments\nIdentification and functional assays to identify mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance: To prepare for comparison of changes in gene expression manifested by tardigrades (water bears) exposed to multigenerational spaceflight with ground-based stresses we have begun gathering transcriptomic datasets from terrestrial stresses. In addition we have performed functional experiments to assess which candidate genes from our transcriptomic datasets are functional mediators of desiccation (drying) tolerance.\nOur major findings from these endeavors have been published in Boothby et al., 2017 (Boothby TC, Pielak GJ. Intrinsically disordered proteins and desiccation tolerance: Elucidating functional and mechanistic underpinnings of anhydrobiosis. Bioessays. 2017 Nov;39(11):700119. Epub 2017 Sep 13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201700119\n; PubMed\nPMID: 28901557\n; Ed. Note 9/9/19: reported in August 2018 FY2018 Task Book report Bibliography ). These results will be summarized here briefly since detailed descriptions of the experiments, methods, and results are presented in publication.\nTo identify genes that might play a role in tardigrade desiccation tolerance, we extracted and sequenced RNA from tardigrades that had either been left unstressed in culture or desiccated. Comparison of transcript levels coming from each predicted gene was conducted and genes ranked based on fold change (how much expression of the gene increased during drying) and overall abundance (how many transcripts per million transcripts were coming from a particular gene).\nThe main takeaway from this comparison was that a class of tardigrade specific genes known as Cytosolic Abundant Heat Soluble (CAHS) genes are upregulated heavily during desiccation. We performed RNA interference experiments in tardigrades to reduce the level of expression of these genes and found that the animals no longer robustly survived drying when CAHS genes were targeted. We also found that expressing these genes in bacteria and yeast (which normally do not have these genes) led to up to two orders of magnitude increases (100X) in desiccation tolerance. Amazingly, when purified CAHS proteins were found to protect biological material (the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase) about an order of magnitude (10X) better than current FDA approved excipient trehalose and serum albumin.\nFinally, we correlate the protective capabilities of these CAHS proteins to their ability to form vitrified (glass-like) solids, as opposed to crystalline solids. These finding may be of interest to NASA, as this presents an avenue for stabilizing and protecting biological material in a dry state without refrigeration. This might be useful for prolonged storage of biomaterials on the ISS or other spaceflight missions where freezer and refrigeration space is limited or logistically difficult.\nExploring cross-tolerance between desiccation and freeze tolerances in tardigrades:\nTardigrades survive an amazing number of abiotic stresses, and in some cases the severity of these stresses is well beyond that tardigrades would ever experience in nature (e.g., temperatures close to absolute zero, thousands of gray of radiation, the vacuum of outer space). The question therefore arises--how did tardigrades evolve tolerance to stresses they have never experienced? One hypothesis is that as tardigrades moved onto land from the ocean (where they originally evolved) they developed desiccation tolerance in response to their new, dryer, conditions and as a by-product became tolerant to other stresses. If this hypothesis is correct, then the mediators that tardigrades use to survive desiccation should in theory be the same mediators they use to survive other stresses. To assess if this is true we performed transcriptome sequencing on tardigrades that had been frozen, and compared this data to our previous datasets (desiccated and unstressed).\nSurprisingly, we found that changes in gene expression between desiccated and frozen tardigrades are highly divergent. In fact, either stress condition is more similar to unstressed conditions than they are to each other. Most telling, we observed that expression of CAHS genes was not influenced by freezing conditions, and furthermore RNA interference targeting these genes did not result in statistical decreases in survival in tardigrades exposed to freezing conditions.\nThese results are presented in detail in Boothby et al., 2017 (Boothby TC, Pielak GJ. Intrinsically disordered proteins and desiccation tolerance: Elucidating functional and mechanistic underpinnings of anhydrobiosis. Bioessays. 2017 Nov;39(11):700119. Epub 2017 Sep 13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201700119\n; PubMed\nPMID: 28901557\n; Ed. Note 9/9/19: reported in August 2018 FY2018 Task Book report Bibliography ).\nWe are now delving more into our frozen transcriptome to identify functional mediators of freeze tolerance in tardigrades using a similar approach to the one taken for our desiccation study.\nUnderstanding to commonalities and differences between how tardigrades survive freezing and desiccation is an important facet of our overall strategy for this project, as spaceflight induced changes in gene response will ultimately be compared to ground-based stress responses. Comparing changes in gene expression for ground-based stresses now will help us understand the overlap with spaceflight induced changes later.\nHow do tardigrade CAHS proteins mediate desiccation tolerance?\nTo better understand of CAHS proteins protect tardigrades and other biological material and cells from the harmful effects of drying, and how these proteins might protect biological materials from other stresses (included spaceflight), we have been characterizing the biochemical and biophysical nature of these proteins.\nWe have discovered that these proteins behave in a very peculiar way. At room temperature and at concentrations greater than or equal to 30 g/L these proteins form reversible hydrogels. We have characterized the gel state of these proteins via cone plate rheometry as well as scanning electron microscopy. Both techniques clearly demonstrate that these proteins have classic gel-like behavior and morphology. In retrospect it makes sense that these proteins form hydrogels, as hydrogels are known to form vitrified solids when dried (see above).\nWe were curious if the gel state of these proteins is important for their protective capabilities. To probe this, we used 19-F NMR to look at the folded state of a test protein, SH3. SH3 is a ‘metastable’ protein, meaning that normally (in solution) SH3 is in a folded state ~50% of the time and in an unfolded state about ~50% of the time. This is easily measured using 19-F NMR. We first tested SH3 in solution, and as expected two clear peaks (folded and unfolded) were present. We then co-incubated SH3 with a CAHS protein (at increasing concentrations) and looked at the levels of folded and unfolded protein. We found that CAHS proteins had no noticeable effect on SH3 folding below 30 g/L. However, above 30 g/L of CAHS protein, there was a reduction in the level of unfolded SH3 protein, and a corresponding increase in folded SH3. Interestingly, 30 g/L is the concentration determined by cone plate rheometer as the gel point for these proteins. The hydrogels that CAHS proteins form are reverse and heat dependent. Therefore, we tested whether heating to induce the breakdown of the hydrogel influenced SH3 folding. We found when heated from 19C to 42C the CAHS proteins went back into solution (the gel state vanished) and there was a return of an SH3 unfolded population. Cooling this solution back down to 19C resulted in re-gelling of the CAHS proteins and a corresponding disappearance of the SH3 unfolded species and an increase in the SH3 folded species. Therefore, it appears that there is a strong correlation between the gelled state of CAHS proteins and their ability to stabilize proteins in a folded state.\nWe are now characterizing the sequence features of CAHS proteins at allow them to form gels. These studies are being conducted by making mutant versions of the proteins and testing their ability to form gels and protect biological materials.\nTesting and Validation for Flight Experiment\nThe bulk of this effort has been made in preparing for and performing our Science Validation Test (SVT-1).\nThe main goal of SVT-1 was to compare the efficacy of culturing tardigrades (Hypsibius exemplasris) using the CellMax and PI Start Kit (PISK).\nSyringes containing ~500 tardigrades or concentrated algae were prepared using the same stock cultures. Syringes were frozen at -80 degrees Celsius and either stored at this temperature or shipped on dry ice to NASA Ames.\nOn May 10th, tardigrades were injected into 3 PISK bioreactors (at NASA Ames) and 3 CellMax Bioreactors (at UNC).\nTemperature control for PISK bioreactors was carried out using integrated temperature control – which varied between ~15 – 17 degrees Celsius. Oxygenation for PISK bioreactors was carried out via gas dosing using medical grade air.\nTemperature control for CellMax bioreactors was carried out by placing the CellMax system in a controlled temperature chamber. The initial temperature used was 15 degrees Celsius, but was changed to 16 degrees Celsius to more closely mirror PISK temperatures. Oxygenation was not controlled, but rather relied on the passive transport of oxygen across the CellMax systems permeable tubing.\nEvery 7 days, up to day 21, subsamples (300 ul) were extracted from both PISK and CellMax bioreactors using syringes. These samples were stored at -80 degrees Celsius. At day 14, fresh algae (food source) was injected into each PISK and CellMax bioreactor. At day 28, the experiment ended and whole bioreactors were detached and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. PISK subsample syringes and bioreactors were returned frozen on dry ice to the Principal Investigator's (PI) lab at UNC.\nUpon receipt at the PI’s lab, samples were transferred from their shipping unit to a -80 degree freezer.\nTo compare the viability of culturing using the PISK, all samples were thawed. For each subsample (300 ul) the entire volume of thawed sample was analyzed by direct observation using a dissecting microscope. Total animal counts were taken and densities calculated. Similarly, for bioreactors, the entire contents of the bioreactor was thawed and transferred to a 15 mL tube. Three 50 ul samples were taken from each tube and total animal counts made and densities calculated.\nThe remaining bioreactor contents was fixed with RNAlater and processed for total RNA extraction.\nTardigrade Densities and Total Counts\nPrior to testing our definition for success was achieving Day 28 animal densities in the PISK bioreactors that were above or within 20% of the densities from our CellMax bioreactors. Our average PISK animal density at Day 28 was 357.8 animals/mL where as our CellMax Day 28 animal density was slightly lower at 282.2 animals/mL. By our original definition, the PISK successfully competed with the CellMax system with regards to effectively culturing tardigrades over a 28 day period.\nREPORTING IN AUGUST 2018\nWe have been preparing for our flight experiment. This has mostly manifested itself in the development of an SRD (Science Requirements Document), protocols, and coordinating with the engineering team who are doing some final tests on our bioreactor setup. Our next step will be to actually get our animals in the hardware and do ground tests.",

            "task_description": "Parasitoid wasps are obligate parasites of their insect hosts. Most parasitoid wasps of Drosophila attack larval stages of fruit flies and consume the developing host, while growing inside its body. A normal immune response to wasp attack consists of the so-called encapsulation response in which dozens of differentiated blood cells or hemocytes migrate toward the egg to tightly encase, melanize and kill it. Parasitoid wasps produce factors in their venom to disrupt this immune reaction to ensure their success.   In this study we examined the relative success of natural hosts and their parasites reared in space. We also assessed the effects of spaceflight on the immune physiology of Drosophila hosts and on parasite virulence.  Two host strains, without and with inflammatory tumors, and two wasp species, differing in infection strategies were used in the experiment. Using physiological, cellular and molecular readouts, we found:   (a) Flies without tumors and chronic inflammation were more sensitive to spaceflight conditions than tumor-bearing flies suffering from inflammation. Many essential genes in ‘healthy’ flies were downregulated. (b) Spaceflight spiked the expression of inflammation genes in fruit flies of both strains; space-travel enhanced tumor growth in tumor-bearing flies; larval progeny of these ‘space’ flies showed a higher tumor burden and were more strongly immune reactive than ‘ground’ controls. (c) Spaceflight did not significantly affect parasitic wasp development, emergence, or the expression of virulence genes; (d) Parasite mutants of one wasp species with defects in wing color, wing shape, and ovipositor morphology were identified and obtained.  Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to human and animal health during spaceflight. Our studies reveal the unique and shared effects of spaceflight on the physiology and gene expression on distinct strains of Drosophila hosts. They show that metazoan parasites retain their infection strategies in space and highlight the resilience of parasite development in the space environment.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Parasitic wasps of Drosophila are a powerful and increasingly well-characterized model for understanding longstanding questions about natural host/parasite interactions, allowing molecular genetic examination of both innate immune mechanisms in fly hosts and virulence mechanisms of their wasp parasites. Distant relatives of these parasitic wasps are used for biocontrol of agricultural pests worldwide.\nThe \"Earth benefits\" impact of our research are as follows:\n(a)  RNA-Seq analysis of adult fruit flies (wild type and mutants developing inflammatory microtumors) will help in understanding the effects of spaceflight in humans and develop countermeasures for immune dysfunction.\n(b) RNA-Seq analysis of parasite transcriptomes in response to spaceflight with emphasis on virulence-related genes is providing novel insights into how endoparasites (those that develop within their hosts) react to the pressures as they develop in low Earth orbit.\nWhereas RNA-Seq-based gene expression analysis is now a standard experimental approach in biomedical research, the paucity of space-related research opportunities applied to model organisms have not allowed the potential of such ‘omics’ approaches to be realized toward spaceflight experiments. Our studies of this unique host-parasite system are among the first of their kind and will provide foundational data and resources for future studies.\n(c) In addition, the isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understating of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology. Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The space environment is likely to have as yet unknown impacts on the animal immune function; refining our understanding of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space.\n(d) Four undergraduate students and one post-doctoral fellow were trained over last year.

            "task_progress": "Whereas previous spaceflight experiments in model organisms – such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and in humans – have shown that the immune system function in space is compromised, similar studies examining the immune system’s interaction with natural pathogens and parasites in space have not been undertaken. With increased investments and opportunities in spaceflight, space travel by humans is becoming more frequent and will even be the norm in the years to come. In this context, it is important to ask how spaceflight affects natural pathogens and parasites in model organisms and in human hosts, especially if the hosts have dysfunctional immunity or are immune-compromised. To address this question, we examined the effects of spaceflight in Drosophila melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to-and-back from the International Space Station, aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission in the spring of 2018.\nParasitoid wasps are obligate parasites of their insect hosts. Most parasitoid wasps of Drosophila attack larval stages of fruit flies and consume the developing host, while growing inside its body. A normal immune response to wasp attack consists of the so-called encapsulation response in which dozens of differentiated blood cells or hemocytes migrate toward the egg to tightly encase, melanize, and kill it. Parasitoid wasps produce factors in their venom to disrupt this immune reaction to ensure their success.\nThe experimental design of our project consisted of two host strains, tumor-free flies with normal immunity (control flies), and mutant flies with chronic inflammatory tumors, due to hyperactive immunity (CI flies). Each of these hosts was infected by either of two wasp species (fly-host co-cultures), that differ in their infection strategies. One wasp species modifies the shapes of hemocytes, whereas the other kills hemocytes, to block encapsulation and gain control over the host. Hemocytes fight off wasp infections by making up the wasp capsules. Parasite-free flies (fly-only cultures) were also included in the experiments as controls.\nWe examined (a) the relative success of hosts versus parasites, (b) the effects of spaceflight on the immune physiology of Drosophila hosts, and (c) the effects of spaceflight on parasite virulence itself. We also searched for the detrimental effects of space radiation on wasp morphology. Using physiological, cellular, and molecular readouts of the space-returned animals and their corresponding ground controls, we found:\n(a) Fewer than expected control flies returned to Earth, while the tumor-bearing CI flies succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. Thus, tumor-free control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight conditions than CI flies. This result is counter-intuitive and unexpected. Molecular analysis revealed that in the tumor-free control flies (but not in the mutant CI flies), many genes important for essential life functions were downregulated. Furthermore, the orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. In both fly strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins), that contribute to cuticle and chorion structures, were strongly affected in space.\n(b) Spaceflight spiked the expression of inflammation genes in fruit flies of both control and CI strains; space travel enhanced tumor growth in tumor-bearing flies; larval progeny of these ‘space’ flies showed a higher tumor burden and were more strongly immune reactive than ‘ground’ controls. In addition, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains and even though the control flies did not develop tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased.\n(c) Surprisingly, spaceflight did not significantly affect parasitic wasp development, or their emergence. In addition, the effects on the expression of virulence genes was also not significant. In one of the two wasp species, virulence particles were seen normally distributed within the hosts. Together these results suggest that the effects of the space stressors on the parasite, that develops within the fly host, are quite modest.\n(d) Orbiting ~400 kilometer above Earth, life in the International Space Station is subjected to somewhat higher levels of space radiation than organisms on Earth are. In this research project, we identified two parasite mutants of one of the two wasp species. These mutants show defects in wing color, wing shape, and ovipositor morphology. To identify these mutants, we examined the grandsons of the male wasps born in space. A mutant that affects wing color (aurum, for golden wings, instead of the normal grey wings) breeds true, while the other mutant in which wing shape is affected (kona, angular wing shape relative to the normal round edge), cannot lay eggs in hosts due to structural defects in the ovipositor. These genetic variants are the only live mutant strains for this class of parasites and will be useful for research on host-parasite interaction studies on Earth.  Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to human and animal health during spaceflight. Our studies reveal the unique and shared effects of spaceflight on the physiology and gene expression on distinct strains of Drosophila hosts. They show that metazoan parasites retain their infection strategies in space and highlight the resilience of parasite development in the space environment. Continued analysis of such systems, using model hosts and their various parasites, will help establish multigenerational studies and obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.",

            "task_description": "Beneficial microbes play a significant role in the normal development of animal tissues. Through the formation of healthy stable associations between host and symbiont, particularly during post-embryonic development, carefully regulated developmental pathways can be induced.\nIn this experimental research plan, we propose to examine the impact of microgravity on the normal molecular interactions between host and symbiont. To examine these effects we propose to use the model system between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. For over two decades this squid-vibrio model has served as an ideal ecosystem to examine the influences of mutualistic bacteria on animal development. To simulate microgravity, rotating bioreactors called high-aspect-ratio rotating wall vessel bioreactors (HARVs) will be used to provide a low-shear environment for both the host and symbiont, thereby simulating microgravity. Specifically, we propose the following:\nObjective 1. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.\nObjective 2. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria exposure under microgravity conditions.\nObjective 3. Develop a flight-ready microtiter plate for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis in this new hardware.\nThe proposed work has several implications for the field of space biology. First, by examining how normal healthy symbioses are initiated and maintained under microgravity conditions, we can begin to determine the sensitivity of these ecosystems to perturbations in the space environment. Secondly, we can assess the genetic and metabolic responses to gravity in the presence and absence of symbiosis, potentially identifying previously unknown triggers or cues associated with post-embryonic animal development.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "All animals form symbiotic associations with bacteria. These ubiquitous interactions are essential for the normal development and health of the host organism. This project helps to improve our understanding of the molecular cross-talk that occurs between animals and microbes by delineating those genes and pathways that are influenced by gravity.

            "task_progress": "A. Project Overview – This project examined the impact of microgravity on commensal, non-pathogenic microbes that associate with animal tissues. To address this issue we conducted an integrative study in which the responses of both animal host and microbe were examined in situ under simulated microgravity conditions. The long-term goal of the research was to assess whether those interactions between animal cells and mutualistic bacteria undergo a significant alteration in cell-cell communication, immune response, and physiology under microgravity conditions. The overall objective of this proposal was to examine the genomic expression patterns of a host symbiotic squid Euprymna scolopes in response to the luminescent bacterial symbiont, Vibrio fischeri. The results of this study helped identify those genetic pathways that are differentially regulated in the host animal in the presence and absence of mutualistic bacteria under simulated microgravity conditions, thereby improving our understanding of human health in the space environment.\nB. Major Findings and Outcomes of Research\n1. The symbiotic V. fischeri appear to modulate the host innate immune and oxidative stress response of the host light organ during modeled microgravity conditions. Using RNA-seq we analyzed the transcriptome of the host light organ (i.e., the site of symbiosis) of the squid in the presence (symbiotic) and absence (aposymbiotic) of beneficial V. fischeri under simulated microgravity conditions. At 12 h post inoculation both the symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with hemocyanin, oxidative stress, and the innate immune system. However, by 24 h post inoculation only the aposymbiotic animals exhibited an upregulated stress response, whereas those animals exposed to V. fischeri no longer showed the stress response suggesting that V. fischeri is helping to modulate the host response. Results were published in Casaburi et al., 2017 – See cumulative bibliography for citation; reported in FY2018 report.\n2. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shedding by V. fischeri is increased under simulated microgravity conditions. Under modeled microgravity conditions V. fischeri releases a statistically higher amount of the virulence factor LPS, known to cause apoptosis and inflammation in both mutualistic and pathogenic microbes. The LPS production is primarily associated with flagellar movement and by knocking out flagellar production and motion the amount of LPS produced under both microgravity and gravity conditions was reduced. However, even with the removal of the flagella, the LPS shedding was still statistically higher in modeled microgravity conditions compared to gravity conditions. We have ascertained that under modeled microgravity the V. fischeri membrane integrity is compromised and is more susceptible to antibiotic treatment. We are examining whether we can further inhibit the differential shedding of LPS under modeled microgravity conditions.\n3. Sequencing and closure of the Euprymna scolopes genome revealed two evolutionary mechanisms for symbiotic organ evolution.  Using the RNA-seq data generated during this project we generated a reference transcriptome for the host animal and use that as a scaffold to close the genome of E. scolopes. Although this task was not originally part of our project goals the data was invaluable in providing a closed genome for the squid-vibrio research community. Analysis of the genome and reference transcriptome revealed that there are two distinctive evolutionary processes associated with the origin of symbiotic organs in animals. A manuscript is currently in press at PNAS.\n4. Modeled microgravity alters the innate immune pathway of host squid. Using the new technique NanoString, we complemented the previously generated transcriptomes by analyzing the differential gene expression along additional time points (0, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24 h) and have generated a new model of the receptor and signal cascade of the innate immune system. We have also determined that modeled microgravity impacts the expression of the innate immune genes and we have identified key parts of the pathway that are being disrupted. (Publication in preparation.)\n5. Modeled microgravity does not significantly alter the transcriptome of the symbiont V. fischeri; however, the global regulatory gene hfq is critical to regulate the bacterial stress responses in low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). The transcriptome of the bacterial symbiont was examined during both exponential and stationary phase growth and results indicated that modeled microgravity had no significant impact on gene expression at 12 and 24 h. However, when the global regulator gene hfq was deleted from the bacteria, there was a pronounced change in gene expression under LSMMG conditions. There was a dramatic increase in the number of transcripts associated with TCA cycling and stress responses suggesting that the Hfq protein serves as a critical regulator for the bacteria under modeled microgravity conditions.

Our approach spans comprehensive phenomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics strategies, and is incisively and uniquely melded via deployment of an integrated computational biology (ICB) approach we are pioneering. Our plant lines include wild type, various mutants we have generated with different lignin amounts through manipulation of the multigene family encoding arogenate dehydratases, and other lines enhanced in carbon assimilation capacity, and combinations thereof. We consider this places us in an unprecedented position to investigate how plants function in altered gravity environments.\nWe are very well positioned for incisive spaceflight and definition stage (1g) studies to investigate gene/metabolic network relationships and adaptations resulting from varying lignin and carbon assimilation levels, e.g., on photosynthesis; C allocation; water use efficiency (WUE); vascular plant growth/development; vasculature performance; auxin transport; and gravitational adaptations. Our  overarching hypothesis is that a comprehensive interrogation (an integrative omics study) of our Arabidopsis lines with varying lignin levels and/or modulated carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) or combination thereof will identify gene/metabolic networks, mechanisms and/or pathways that are differentially modulated at 1g and on exposure to microgravity, i.e., various omics (phenomics,  transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and ICB) will allow us to study these in a truly unprecedented way.\nOverall objectives:\n1. Establish multi “omics” effects of modulating lignin and CCM levels i) at 1g and ii) in spaceflight.\n2. Compare/contrast data, using an ICB approach, to better define and understand gravity sensing and responses, and if threshold/induction parameters are modified or changed, when lignin and CCM levels are varied.\nMore specifically, we address distinct hypotheses for our various teams, and integrate, dissect, and incisively analyze them holistically in a manner hitherto not possible. These 5 hypotheses include that: modulating lignin and CCM levels differentially affect carbon assimilation/re-allocation, photosynthesis, and WUE (Team 1); modulating lignin and CCM levels differentially affect secondary and primary metabolite levels (metabolomics) (Team 2); system-wide modification in the transcriptome occurs through a common transcriptional regulatory mechanism, and transcriptome/proteome “discrepancies” result from over-simplification of transcript analyses (Team 3); differential alterations in lignin and CCM levels can often be attributed to overall distinct changes in protein expression and phosphorylation patterns in a defined set of proteins (Team 4); an integrated omics analysis will provide urgently needed new insights into global effects on plant biological processes at both 1g and in microgravity (Teams 1-4). Each hypothesis draws upon the most advanced technologies available for study. We consider that our ICB approach will transform omics analysis through our advanced instrumentation and analytical tools. We will utilize (or design) computational tools/mathematical algorithms for integration and correlation of high resolution phenotype measurements (phenomics) with 'low' resolution global subcellular system measurements (transcriptomics, etc.) through 'nth' dimensional analysis.\nOur study aligns with Research Emphasis 1 and 3, and decadal survey elements in Cell, Microbial, and Molecular Biology (CMM-3, CMM-5), Organismal and Comparative Biology (OCB 2-5), Developmental Biology (DEV-4), and Plant and Microbial Biology, chapter 4 (P2).

Lignin provides plant cell wall reinforcement, thereby enabling plants to stand upright. Lignin-reduced genotypes, unable to stand upright, were utilized to determine whether structural lignin reinforcement was required in microgravity on ISS. These genotypes offered the exciting opportunity to investigate the central question as to whether there was a threshold lignin level needed for Arabidopsis to stand upright in microgravity.\nConsortium Team Partners: This included research scientists from Washington State University (WSU), University of New Mexico (UNM), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and ISS astronauts.\nObjectives and results:\n1).

By contrast, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of corresponding biochemical pathway steps generally showed increased abundances, but such responses were ultimately futile in restoring either lignin or secondary metabolite levels.\nISS prototype APH flight unit installation and functional verification: Astronaut Ricky Arnold completed on-orbit Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) installation, with first power-up and 5-day functional checkout on December 01, 2017. Science Carrier with WT Arabidopsis and dwarf wheat seeds in the ISS APH prototype were then successfully flood filled. Plants seemingly looked healthy over a 37-day growth period in Spring 2018.\nISS and KSC Arabidopsis genotype sequential grow-outs: This was the inaugural investigation for the ISS APH prototype, and the project was named PH-01 by NASA personnel. 192 Arabidopsis rosette leaf and stem tissues were collected for multi-omics analyses at circa 6 week growth/development/lignification. Roots were not harvested as APH Science Carrier technical design precluded this.\nPH-01 Grow-out 1: 46 Arabidopsis plants (Day 45) harvested on ISS stored in –160 °C GLACIER freezer until return to Earth (Splashdown, Pacific Ocean, January 13, 2019), with frozen Arabidopsis samples transported and delivered to Institute of Biological Chemistry (IBC), Washington State University (WSU). Samples were immediately stored at –80 °C at WSU until needed. KSC Ground Control Arabidopsis tissues (from 46 plants) were transported/delivered in frozen form to IBC/WSU and stored as above.\nPH-01 Grow-out 2: PH-01 Grow-out 2 was highlighted in NASA’s first 8K video (1.2 M views to date since its release 5 years ago;\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/8k-science).\n43 similarly frozen plants, following harvesting on Day 45, were returned to Earth January 7, 2020, then transported/delivered frozen to IBC/WSU and stored as above. KSC Ground Control Arabidopsis tissues (from 40 plants) were also transported/delivered in frozen form to IBC/WSU and stored as above.\nAPH plant health, plant genotype validation, and APH functional performance assessments: Overhead and side camera images were used daily to assess plant health and growth, and stem orientations, during ISS and KSC Grow-outs. Plant growth was estimated by measuring rosette leaf areas, where it was concluded that ISS-grown plants lagged in growth/development relative to KSC counterparts. PAM photosynthesis measurements showed higher variability on ISS, relative to KSC, presumably reflecting higher stresses experienced on ISS. Both ISS and KSC grown Arabidopsis genotypes, nevertheless, all looked robust and healthy visually.   Stems of ISS lignin-reduced mutants were, however, unable to stand upright, and subsequently discovered have to abnormal stem vasculature cross-sections when compared to KSC grown specimens – all consistent with a higher lignin level threshold being needed to grow upright, even in microgravity. This was an unexpected finding, and opposite to conventional wisdom.\nArabidopsis tissues, for multi-omics analyses, had genotypes validated on return to Earth. Of the 192 specimens evaluated by PCR, 4 rosette leaf samples did not have the genotypes as assigned to their designated APH Science Carrier position number, and these were accordingly amended.\nISS and KSC ICB multi-omics analyses: The comprehensive analyses and ‘big data’ compilation represented a significant spaceflight (ISS) multi-omics ICB baseline study for Arabidopsis. However, meaningful integration of multi-omics data is a well-known problematic issue across all biology disciplines. Accordingly, our inter-disciplinary team effort focused upon integration and analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics (including initial emphasis on secondary and primary metabolites, lipids, and lignin). Our approach was designed to tease out key ISS spaceflight environment effects relative to KSC counterparts.\nICB metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics analyses: ISS lignin levels were generally lower than KSC Ground Controls and resulting from slower plant growth on ISS. Secondary metabolite (stem and rosette leaf) profiles for both ISS and KSC Grow-outs had similar profiles, with flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, glucosinolate, and shikimate-chorismate pathway levels generally becoming (increasingly) lower in lignin-deficient genotypes. The mainly primary metabolite analyses of stems established shikimic acid and phenylpropanoid levels on average also decreased in genotypes most lignin-deficient, relative to WT, for both stem/rosette leaf tissues in ISS/KSC Grow-outs 1 and 2. Aromatic amino acids, Phe and Tyr, in stems showed similar trends whereas in rosette leaves results were more varied for the same genotypes.  In contrast, bona fide biochemical steps for the above secondary metabolite pathways generally showed increased proteome and transcriptome abundances in lignin-deficient genotypes, but these were again futile in restoring either lignin or secondary metabolite WT genotype levels, whether ISS or KSC grown.\nTowards determining ICB transcriptomic and proteomic effects on photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and photorespiration: Our ICB approach also targeted photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and oxidative phosphorylation to evaluate whether photosynthesis and photorespiration were affected. Transcription profiles from Grow-out 2 (with transcripts from chloroplast and mitochondrial encoding proteins retained) indicated that Photosystems I and II subunits were down-regulated in a lignin-reduced genotype (ISS vs KSC), as were two rate-limiting Calvin cycle enzymes.  Our preliminary analysis of global transcript levels clearly revealed a dramatic shift in transcriptome machinery and Calvin cycle proteins, but it remains to be determined whether one or more mechanisms are responsible for the varied genotype responses to differing lignin contents. Proteomic analyses were apparently similar, together with indications that photorespiration had increased in lignin-deficient genotypes.\nTowards better understanding ICB transcriptomic and proteomic effects for radiation and DNA repair on ISS-grown Arabidopsis genotypes: Numerous genes associated with base/nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination were statistically differentially expressed (DE) in the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment. The largest lignin-deficient mutants had more DE, suggesting different genotype responses to increased radiation in the ISS spaceflight environment. Proteins related to radiation damage repair in ISS Grow-out 1 also increased in abundance, as compared to KSC counterparts. DNA repair and recombination proteins, DNA replication, and homologous recombination proteins were additionally affected. This observation may suggest that plants with reduced lignin levels were more prone to DNA damage in the ISS spaceflight environment.\nTowards determining ICB single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects on ISS grown Arabidopsis genotypes: Our transcription analysis unexpectedly suggest that mutation rates might be lower in ISS vs KSC samples. This was unexpected given the ISS spaceflight environment (including radiation and microgravity) experienced. A provisional hypothesis for these results includes possibility of over-expression of DNA repair mechanisms resulting from exposure to the ISS spaceflight environment. This would be consistent with the observed differential regulation of DNA repair mechanisms observed. Such over-expression could cause more mutations to be corrected, as compared to the baseline rate of mutations observed with KSC samples. Alternatively, ISS plants were possibly more stressed due to microgravity and increased radiation, thereby (at least in part) causing slower organismal growth rates. Slower growth rates would correspond to slower and fewer cell divisions, which could conceivably reduce the number of observed mutations across all cells in each tissue sample.\nTowards correlating ICB proteomic and transcriptomic ISS spaceflight responses as regards cell signaling and microbial perception/susceptibility for ISS Arabidopsis genotypes: Initial analysis of differential expression observed in ISS (as compared to KSC) samples revealed more differential regulation in leaf compared to stem tissues. This trend was present in both transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, albeit to a lesser extent with protein abundance differences. Functional Term enrichment analysis showed photosynthesis-related proteins significantly down-regulated in leaf samples on ISS compared to KSC, this being consistent with previous studies of plant responses to stress conditions.   Up-regulation at the transcript level for leaf samples on ISS was concentrated in signaling, and related genes, as well as genes involved in systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Various proteins related to cell signaling followed the same trend and increased in abundance in Arabidopsis plants with least lignin contents. For stem samples on ISS, no GO terms were significantly enriched among protein sets, but for transcriptomic features, down-regulation of growth and development and up-regulation of defense responses and signaling highlighted the list of regulatory differences. Several disease resistant proteins, and precursors to a hypersensitive response (HR), were significantly upregulated, perhaps suggesting attempted acclimation to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment.  Exosome and membrane trafficking proteins are often involved in protection against pathogenic attack. As lignification also plays a role in plant-pathogen/microbial defenses, it may be that ISS grown plants with reduced lignin levels are more prone to increased pathogen susceptibility in the spaceflight ISS microgravity environment.\nTowards completion of IBC multi-omics analyses and visualization: Significant progress was made in integrating/comparing the diverse multi-omics datasets to gain both new and comprehensive insights into the systems-level response(s) to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment with the six Arabidopsis genotypes. Metabolomics data was used as a cross-check.  Pathway analysis used targeted and untargeted approaches. The former involved extracting features from each dataset associated with various structural (biochemical) pathways and comparing fold changes in ISS vs KSC across genotypes. The latter involved use of a LANL developed tool OPaver (Omics Pathway Viewer). Opaver enabled us to map differential expression/abundance values onto curated KEGG pathway maps for multi-omics datasets. Our analysis to date indicates that some metabolic pathways were augmented by the ISS spaceflight environment conditions vs KSC, but analysis is still ongoing.\nOutreach:\nOutreach was an important component of this ISS/KSC study, but with no direct support from the NASA supported project here. The Outreach components are summarized further below.\nSummary and future steps: An important and continuing contribution was in providing the best possible multi-omics integration analyses for the various Arabidopsis genotypes grown on ISS and at KSC. Our massive datasets and other documentation, although embargoed until publication, are currently being provided to NASA Gene Lab for curation, as well as to data repositories required for publication. It is anticipated that our multi-omics integration will continue to take an additional 12 months or so to fully complete – including giving additional attention to effects of radiation on ISS and potentially different effects on the various Arabidopsis genotypes.   Ongoing analyses include determining the full extent of physiological modulations induced in the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment, by: 1) more detailed mapping of transcripts to specific intra-cellular compartments (i.e. chloroplast, mitochondria, etc.) in order to more fully understand how microgravity on ISS modulates various metabolic pathways; 2) deducing what trends may be uniquely attributed to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment; 3) further addressing the proposal hypotheses that system-wide modifications noted in ADT KO and WT Arabidopsis genotypes may be caused (in part) through a common transcriptional regulatory mechanism.\nGlossary: Metabolomics here included analyses and quantification of secondary metabolites (many with plant defense functions), lipids (largely fatty, waxy, or oily compounds), primary metabolites (considered essential for plant growth and development), and lignin. Transcriptomics and proteomics were used for detection of gene expression and corresponding protein/enzyme profiles (and their individual abundances) at the circa 6 week harvesting stage for both ISS and KSC Grow-outs. Phenomics included photosynthesis measurements using a hand-held pulse-amplitude monitoring (PAM) device, used for the first time on ISS, as well as in monitoring of rosette leaf tissue areas and of ‘bolting’ stem orientations during Arabidopsis growth/development/lignification. Cell wall anatomical analyses of both ISS and KSC Arabidopsis stems were used to determine whether ISS grown Arabidopsis stem vasculature differed from corresponding KSC Ground Controls.\nUnexpected setbacks: Germination and plant death/dying difficulties were experienced in both ISS Grow-outs. This required analysis of ISS APH functionality data records, as such difficulties did not occur during KSC Grow-outs. It was concluded that there was uneven APH watering in growing all needed plant genotypes and, in particular, for ISS Grow-out 1, as well as intermittent ISS APH partial lighting failures for Grow-out 2. Furthermore, analysis of water availability at different growth positions in the APH on ISS was a complication that can hopefully be better teased out from further analyses of multi-omics and ISS APH data for both Grow-outs. In both cases, together with slower growth on ISS, only one 6 week harvest was possible for multi-omics analyses.\nSupplementary (Publications to Date, Newsletters, Seminars/Lectures, Presentations, Significant Media Coverage, Training, and Outreach)\nPublications:\nHöhner, R., Marques, J.V., Ito, T., Amakura, Y., Budgeon, A.D., Jr., Weitz, K., Hixson, K.K., Davin, L.B., Kirchhoff, H., and Lewis, N.G.  2018.

He carried out/refined Arabidopsis growth conditions using the Science Carrier that was to be fitted into the APH. The Washington State Space Grant Consortium kindly provided supplementary support for both high school and undergraduate participation. Mr. Pezeshki successfully completed his Senior Project, and which led to several successful outcomes. He gave two posters (one at WSU for the University Showcase, and a second one in October 2017 in Seattle at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) in a session for High School students nationwide). He was also supported by a travel grant from ASGSR to present his work.  Some of Mr. Pezeshki’s activities included:\n•\tSieving, washing, and autoclaving of Turface arcillite particles used as the growing substrate for plants on board ISS, as well as preparation of foam and gauze templates to support the seeds and plants in the final assembly of the Science Carrier unit.\n•\tRecording and editing videos to present to NASA KSC personnel, so that they could review our plant harvesting and processing methods used for RNA, protein, and metabolite extraction. These videos were instrumental for assessing constraints involved in foil pack dimensions required for plant samples for adequate preservation during storage and for rapid processing upon return to Earth. This was helpful for developing procedures necessary for optimizing astronaut crew time spent on harvesting and critical storage of samples in the limited freezer container space aboard ISS.\n•\tAssistance with transgenic plant sample preparation for PCR gene screening analysis. This involved DNA extraction from freshly harvested plant leaves, and use of these samples as DNA templates for the PCR mixtures. Samples were amplified using a thermocycler instrument and then run on an agarose gel for a qualitative analysis assessment.\n•\tDeveloping protocols for harvesting and processing different parts of Arabidopsis plants which included separating leaves, stems, siliques, flowers, etc., and then later on grinding tissues and preparing extracts suitable for our multi-omics studies. He continuously assisted in preparing plant tissue samples for metabolomic analysis. He also prepared a video presentation on this that was also very helpful for the NASA scientists/astronauts by recording this entire process beginning from harvest to extraction.\n•\tStudying effects of humidity on metabolite levels at different harvest times. Mr. Pezeshki individually processed leaf and stem tissues of four and six weeks old Arabidopsis wild type plants grown under low and high humidity conditions. He studied the growth and development (stem length and weight) of Arabidopsis wild type plants harvested at different time intervals. He also successfully completed this experiment without assistance. After he had expertise in preparing tissue samples suitable for metabolomics, he was assigned to study the metabolomics of NASA-SVT (Science verification test) samples.\nPhD students Kim K. Hixson, Qingyan Meng and Jorgen Tacetta: Both K.K. Hixson and Q. Meng completed their PhD degrees (N. G. Lewis, Advisor) in the Molecular Plant Sciences program, Washington State University. Dr. Hixson is currently a Senior Research Scientist at PNNL, and Dr. Meng is a Research Associate in the Lewis Laboratory).  Jorgen Tacetta is in good standing in his Ph.D. studies.\nOutreach:\n•\tThe New Mexico Space Grant Consortium helped to fund a year-long collaboration between Dr. Hanson and the Explora science museum in Albuquerque. They developed and piloted a monthly course called \"Extraterrestrial Botany\" for around twenty students across the city who were in 5th through 9th grade. Ten sessions were developed and taught by a team of 2 post docs (1 female), two technicians (both female, 1 Hispanic), a female graduate student, and three undergraduates (2 female, 1 Hispanic), plus Dr. Hanson and two staff members at Explora. The project involved learning about challenges of space exploration, relevance for life on Earth, and the student assisted with data collection and analysis from the APH-01. Feedback from families and Explora was extremely positive.\n•\tDavid Hanson was lead organizer for a NASA supported In-flight Education Downlink with Astronaut Christina Koch on International Space Station (\nhttps://news.unm.edu/news/nasa-astronaut-chats-live-with-500-students-at-unm).\nThis event had an audience of over 700 people, including over 500 K-12 students that traveled to UNM to participate in person - as well as others watching via an internet live stream (live.unm.edu). The event had many hands-on activity booths from local STEM education programs and guest presentations by NASA scientists and student interns. It was also co-hosted by The Children’s Hour radio program and part of a subsequent hour-long show that was broadcast nationwide. Research from PH-01 was highlighted in the live event (found online at live.unm.edu as well as directly through the NASA past downlinks site-\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/stem-on-station/downlinks.html)\nand on the radio show (\nhttps://www.childrenshour.org/kids-in-space/).\n•\tNorman G. Lewis and Laurence B. Davin partnered with Ms. Kathy Lucchesi (K-7/8 teacher), at McCaffrey Middle School in Galt, California, and their largely Hispanic students. Supplemental funding was provided to the school by NASA and the California Space Grant Consortium so that these middle school students could safely follow and utilize many of the plant growth and development protocols developed for the ISS experiments. One purpose was that the students could  grow plants under similar conditions and obtain information and insights on how the research impacts or benefits life on Earth and beyond (in the future).\no\tDrs. Lewis (Washington State University) and Dr. Sato (NASA Ames) visited McCaffrey Middle School on September 28, 2017, to see first-hand the work underway. Both visitors gave talks on the project, as well as the broader ramifications of NASA research.\no\tThe Galt Herald wrote an article on this visit (\nhttp://www.galtheraldonline.com/news/mccaffrey-students-reach-for-the-stars-in-a-joint-experiment/article_b7047f9e-a93e-11e7-b016-d79e90b47bc5.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=user-share)\n, and the student’s progress was further publicized through the NASA Space Biology Facebook (\nhttps://www.facebook.com/spacebiology/).\no\tProgress with the students was also followed through regular Skype and/or FaceTime team meetings, with Drs. Lewis, Davin, and Costa (WSU). Dr. Hanson (University of New Mexico) provided tutorials on photosynthesis and the use of a FluorPen for their studies.\no\tWritten materials on, and seeds for, the experiments at hand were also routinely provided. The additional aim was in helping teach and inspire these young students about the joys and fun of the scientific method in experimental plant biology. Periodically, middle school students presented results to Dr. Lewis over where such work was being routinely evaluated.\no\tAstronaut Sunita Williams, Dr. Lewis (WSU IBC) and Dr. Sato (NASA Ames) visited the school on April 13, 2018. Astronaut Williams gave presentations on her time on International Space Station and answered questions from students.  The Galt Herald (\nhttp://www.galtheraldonline.com/news/mccaffrey-students-visited-by-space-explorer/article_144aa81a-4334-11e8-842f-f7106ee5d2d7.html)\nand the Lodi News-Sentinel (www.lodinews.com/news/article_982e5434-3faa-11e8-b4e1-db589601c0df.html?mode=story) wrote articles on her visit, and the visit was further publicized through the NASA Space Biology Facebook (\nhttps://www.facebook.com/spacebiology/).\no\t McCaffrey Middle School Students also presented their work on #PlantHabitat01 to the Galt School Board on  (See post at:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/spacebiology/posts/917222148451703).\no\tMs. Lucchesi, her students, and Dr. Lewis visited NASA AMES Research Center, May 28, 2018.

Surprisingly, the small worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a good, cost-effective model for studying the effects of spaceflight upon muscle. Our past experiments on Earth and on the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that the expression of key muscle genes that encode members of a muscle attachment complex is reduced in C. elegans during spaceflight. A key open question is if and how these changes in gene expression result in reduced muscle strength in response to spaceflight. While reduced force production is documented for astronauts, it is yet to be demonstrated for C. elegans. To address this critical knowledge gap, we developed a tiny new device that enables continuous measurement of worm muscle forces. Using this device, on Earth, we have shown that defects in muscle attachment complexes lead to decline in worm muscle strength. Motivated by these past flight data and ground results, we propose to (a) demonstrate the flight-readiness of our miniaturized device for quantitative characterization of muscle strength of C. elegans, (b) test our hypothesis, based on past flight data, that muscle strength decreases in flight as a result of altered muscle gene expression in the worm, and (c) quantify muscle strength loss in spaceflight across multiple worm generations. Successful measurements of muscle strength in flight will make C. elegans a much more complete and comprehensive genomic model for muscle physiology, enabling meaningful translation of discoveries made in C. elegans to astronauts. Our proposed studies have important spin out implications for sarcopenia (an urgent public health problem on Earth) and may produce a terrestrial model for testing potential therapeutic interventions for muscle strength decline in flight.",

            "task_progress": "A major impediment to long-duration space travel is loss of muscle mass and strength during spaceflight. Surprisingly, the microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) is a good, cost-effective model for studying the effects of spaceflight upon muscle. Our past experiments on Earth and the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that the expression of key muscle genes that encode members of a muscle attachment complex is reduced in C.elegans during spaceflight. A key open question is if and how these changes in gene expression result in reduced muscle strength in response to spaceflight. While reduced force production is documented for astronauts, it is yet to be demonstrated for C.elegans.\nTo address this critical knowledge gap, we developed a miniaturized device dubbed \"NemaFlex\" that enables continuous measurement of worm muscle forces based on deflection of soft micropillars. We integrated the NemaFlex device into a worm loading apparatus, so that gravid adult animals of a specific size can be sorted from mixed cultures and evaluated for muscle strength in individual chambers. The spaceflight hardware and worm culture bags were flown as the Micro-16 experiment to the ISS on February 20, 2021, as part of the Northrop Grumman Cygnus NG-15 cargo mission. Experiments were successfully conducted with the crew recording videos of worms deflecting the micropillars in the NemaFlex device. The key results from the spaceflight investigation are: (1) The body diameter of wild-type worms decreased compared to ground controls, potentially due to altered metabolism; (2) The muscle strength of space-adapted worms was lower than that of corresponding worms cultured on ground. Thus, the Micro-16 experiment showed that muscle strength decline occurs in a physiologically relevant animal model, similar to that found in astronauts.\nThe scientific impact of this study is significant as it opens avenues for future investigations to identify drugs that could alleviate the muscle strength decline in space. This spaceflight project contributed to training of more than a dozen personnel, including students and postdocs, on C. elegans, microfluidics and space biology. The funded work resulted in 16 peer-reviewed publications, several student awards, outreach to K-12 students and commercialization of new technologies.",

            "task_description": "Yeast chemical genomics is a powerful tool that is being applied to drug discovery.  This approach allows the study of compound-target relationships in the context of a living cell with a systems biology view that includes both the cell target and the interdependent networks that respond to chemical stress. The modulation of yeast colonies, especially the redox potential, allows study of different drug pathways.\nThis application investigates microbial metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast.  Our previous work has largely defined yeast cellular stress defense response to microgravity, but stress defense responses are only involved in the survival of yeast in liquid cultures.  It has recently been found that survival of plate-based yeast colonies is dependent on signaling mediated through ammonia which drives the multicellular yeast colony to differentiate into two populations, L or lower cells and U or upper cells.  These two populations have different metabolic pathways and establish a cycle of nutrients that allows the U cells to continue to proliferate at the leading edge.  Without ammonia signaling, the entire colony dies. Lack of convection in space is likely to dramatically impact signaling by ammonia, a volatile gas. We postulate that the flow of nutrient and ammonia signals will differ in microgravity where there is little to no convection. We hypothesize that yeast colony survival in microgravity depends on ammonia mediated metabolic adaptation and cell differentiation rather than on stress defense. To test our hypothesis, we will identify the mechanisms mediating colony stratification into U and L cells under multiple gravitational environments: microgravity emulated by Rotating Wall Vessel and Random Positioning Device, static one g cultures, and ultimately microgravity of space flight. Our experimental model will compare liquid and solid phase yeast cultures and make use of available mutant strains of yeast with deletion of the enzymes involved in ammonia signaling and the connected alternative metabolism activation, enzymes involved in stress responses, and the Msn4 promoter and SSA4 gene that we have previously identified as mediating response to microgravity.  Relevant metabolic pathways will be studied using green fluorescent protein-linked reporter genes that can be analyzed by confocal microscopy of intact colonies, and flow cytometry of cells divided into L and U populations by sucrose density centrifugation. There are similarities between multicellular yeast colonies and tumors of clusters of mammalian cells in tissue culture.  Thus insights into the effect of microgravity on cell to cell signaling may have far-reaching applications.\nMicrogravity could provide a physiologically responsive test bed for drug pathway analysis at diverse redox states.",

            "task_progress": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al. 2014; Kachroo et al. 2015; Nislow et al. 2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al. 2009a; Ayer et al. 2014; Herker et al. 2004). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based colonies (Cap et al. 2009a). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colony is dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification of the population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling (Cap et al. 2009a). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays using a deletion series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small molecules in vivo including chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al. 2010). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colony on solid agar models many of the changes seen within solid tumors (Cap et al. 2009a, 2010, 2012a, d).\nYeast is also a popular model for studies of cellular responses to microgravity and microgravity simulations. Multiple flight experiments have verified that S. cerevisiae remains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism [e.g., increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and Volz 1979) and phenotype [e.g., increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al. 1996)]. Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responses of liquid culture yeast to real (e.g., space flight) microgravity and simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al. 2007, 2008a, b; Hammond et al. 1999; Johanson et al. 2002; Nislow et al. 2015). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role in the responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al. 2015). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al. 2008a).\nThe first steps in this initiative were to validate assays for reactive oxygen species and glutathione in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during microgravity simulation.\nThe effects of space flight on yeast have high concordance with agents that induce a very low intracellular redox state, and induce a massive efflux of glutathione. These results raise important issues. Can the reduced redox state during space flight be reproduced and modulated in ground-based simulations? Will this allow definition of unique drug pathways, as a low redox state mirrors the electrophilic properties of mitochondria, where many drugs are metabolized? Unfortunately, assays for redox status and its major cellular determinant, glutathione, are diverse, often cell type specific, and we lack an accepted probe set for yeast studies. This paper validates fluorescent probes for glutathione and reactive oxygen status in yeast to support mechanistic studies of microgravity and drug metabolism. The plethora of fluorescent reagents for reactive oxygen species and glutathione can be bewildering, and makes head-to-head comparisons of all the alternatives impractical. These reagents measure the physiological milieu of reactive oxygen species and diverse thiols, rather than specific individual molecules. We report that in yeast, monochlorobimane (mBCL) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DC-FDA) are suitable for fluorometric and flow cytometry studies of glutathione and reactive oxygen species, respectively. Both dyes have low background fluorescence, predictable loading, good retention, and are non-toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both dyes show concordance with other fluorescent and biochemical assays of reactive oxygen species.\nThe second step in this initiative was to establish the timing, optimal media (rich versus poor) a dynamic range of rotational interventions for low redox potential in giant yeast colonies.  Giant yeast colonies develop a low redox potential, which mimics the electrophilic milieu of both the mitochondrial drug metabolizing compartment, and the hypoxic core of many tumors. The major metabolic mediators of this low redox potential include ATP, glutathione, NAD+/NADH, and NADP+/NADPH. Ammonia signaling is the critical mechanism that induces stratification of the giant yeast colonies to allow a low redox potential. Comparison of two powerful investigative models for drug pathways using Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been compounded by the use of different growth media and stimuli to the system. Chemogenetic profiling, which uses a pool of yeast deletion mutants to determine survival changes, is heavily slanted to the use of rich media. Giant yeast colonies studies are heavily slanted to the use of poor media. The current study answers three questions. First, what are the differences in redox potential and its major metabolic mediators in giant yeast colonies over time? Metabolic status is assayed as glutathione content, redox potential, ATP content, and ratios of NAD to NADH and NADP to NADPH. Second, how does rich versus poor media affect physiological responses of giant yeast colonies? Third, how does clinorotation affect redox potential and its metabolic mediators? Clinorotation is of interest because it randomizes the gravitational vector. That in turn should disrupt the convection-medicated ammonia signaling known to drive giant yeast colony stratification and differentiation. This study demonstrates that the low redox potential status in tumors and drug metabolizing areas of mitochondria can be reproduced in giant yeast colonies grown on both poor and rich media. The study defines the time course and effects of middle molecule mediators from glutathione and ATP to the NAD family of mediators. Rotation proved to be a potent way to selectively modulate ammonia signaling, redox potential, and metabolic mediators.\nThe third step in this initiative was to determine if lack of convection of gaseous ammonia in true microgravity changes the stratification and expansion of in giant yeast models of differentiation and tumorgenesis.\nLittle is known about the effects of space flight on yeast growing as a colony on agar. On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al. 2009b, 2012b, c). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly, thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity driven convection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeast colony differentiation (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). It is not known how the absence of convection seen in microgravity might affect this process.\nTo answer this question, we studied giant yeast colonies formed in true microgravity (i.e., space flight) and in two ground-based simulations of microgravity: rotation and random positioning. Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during space flight (Hammond and Hammond 2001; Lee et al. 2014; Birdsall et al. 2016). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cells and gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al. 2016). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of ‘gravity-vector-averaging’, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al. 2014). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and true microgravity (Grimm et al. 2014), and controversy as to whether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al. 2004; Murdoch et al. 2013; Wuest et al. 2017).\nMetabolic adaption in giant yeast colonies is triggered by the depletion of nutrients in the agar and to enhance this process colonies are typically grown on nutrient-poor agar (Cap et al. 2009a; Palkova et al. 1997). In contrast, studies of yeast in liquid cultures, including chemical genomic assays, tend to use rich media. To evaluate the role of nutrients, we conducted parallel studies of yeast on both nutrient-rich (YPD) and nutrient poor (YE) media.\nThree major analyzes were conducted in yeast grown as giant colonies under true and simulated microgravity. First, we measured the expression of a series of genes likely to be affected by microgravity using clones engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Table 1 lists the clones used and the rationale for their selection. ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies (Cap et al. 2012a, d). BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in space flight (Walther et al. 1996). TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox (Birdsall et al. 2016; Cap et al. 2012d) and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species (Trotter and Grant 2005). EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect (Kshirsagar and Parker 2004).  Second, we evaluated the dependence of two stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, on the stress promoters, Msn4 and Sfp1 (Johanson et al. 2002). We have previously shown that in liquid yeast cultures, SSA4 and RPL34b have novel transcription dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 during space flight that differs from ground-based controls (Coleman et al. 2008a).\nThird, we evaluated the viability and induction of apoptosis in the giant yeast colonies and the dependence of these outcomes on the stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1. The differentiation of giant yeast colonies in terrestrial analyzes is dependent on the promoters Msn4 and Sfp1 (Cap et al. 2012b) but the effects of microgravity on this process are not known.\n100 µ l of stationary culture inocula of each yeast strain were placed in 5 ml of fresh YPD or YE media and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 30°C. Omniwell plates prefilled with 40ml of YE or YPD agar were spotted with 60 µ l of the overnight liquid culture with forty-eight spots per plate. To minimize dehydration after drying the Omniwell lids were sealed to the base with Durapore tape and the plates were placed in plastic Ziploc™ bags. The plates were cooled to 4°C and were divided into five sets of four plates - one set for each of the five growth conditions. Each set contained a full series on YPD agar and a full series on YE agar.\nFlight and static ground control plates were sent to Kennedy Space Center in chilled shipping containers. Just prior to flight, working in a cold room, the plates were transferred to barcoded Ziploc™ bag and stacks of eight were placed in Lexan bags and then into plate habitats (PHABs;\nhttp://www-bioserve.colorado.edu/tech_Sheets_pdfs/SelectBioServeHardware.pdf\n; BioServe Space Technologies, CO). The PHAB is a sealed container that allows for gas exchange but meets NASA safety requirements for levels of containment. (\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/life_support_systems/crew_payload/index.html\n). PHABs were placed in cold bags at 4°C, and remained chilled for five days during handoff to the SpaceX-8 rocket. Flight samples were flown to the International Space Station (ISS). Approximately two days post-launch, the growth of the yeast on ISS was initiated by transferring the PHABs to Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4 (CGBA4) (Hoehn et al. 2004) that was set to 30°C (BioServe Space Technologies, CO). After 28 days in flight, CGBA4 was commanded down to +4°C. The following day the PHABs were moved back to cold bags, and returned to Earth the next day on the Dragon capsule. Plates remained chilled for a total of six days during undocking, return to Earth, salvage, and transport to the lab for flow cytometry analysis.\nThe second set of plates, the static flight controls were loaded into a second set of PHABs at Kennedy Space Center and handled to match the exact timing and temperature profile of the flight samples. Ground controls were conducted with a 24-hour offset relative to the flight samples and the static controls in PHABs followed the same temperature changes as the flown samples.\nA third and fourth set of samples were subjected to Wall-Vessel rotation or random positioning (RPM) during growth. The timing of the rotating and RPM cultures matched that of the flight samples with the exception that they were grown at ambient laboratory conditions (25°C) rather than 30°C and they were not placed in PHABs. To control for the difference, an additional set of static ground controls were maintained in plastic bags at 25°C and also not placed in PHABs. Results from the two set of static controls, PHABs/30°C versus no-PHAB/25°C, did not differ (Pearson correlation >95%) so data from the two were pooled in the statistical analyzes. Similarly, we could not detect any differences due to plate position of the replication using any of the modalities studied (Pearson correlation >95%).\nWe have previously reported on the effects of media and rotation on the viability and redox potential in giant yeast colonies in ground-based studies (Birdsall et al. 2016). In this report, we extend analysis to include giant yeast colonies in the true microgravity of space flight as well as in the microgravity simulation by random positioning (RPM) and 2D rotation (Rotating Wall-Vessel head) positioning. Defining the utility of microgravity and microgravity simulations is confounded by use of different microgravity simulations, different media, and different outcomes. This study is a systematic examination of the effects of true microgravity versus common microgravity simulations, and nutrient rich media versus nutrient poor media, on major mechanistic mediators including shear stress promoters Msn4 and Sfp1, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis. This lays the ground work for future yeast experiments to study cell-to-cell interactions, cell signaling, cell survival, colony differentiation and aging, mechanisms of drug action, and characteristics of tumor generation.\nCell death by necrosis and apoptosis increased in flight as shown by multiple modalities: uptake of propidium iodide up, expression of caspase, and binding of annexin V. Induction of apoptosis by simulated microgravity has been seen with other cell types including human lymphocytes (Ward et al. 2006). This increased cell death was greatly increased by deletion of either of the stress responsive promoters Msn4 or Sfp1. The finding of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is further evidence for activity of both ammonia signaling and stress defense pathways, as ammonia signaling utilizes mostly caspase independent pathways (Vachova and Palkova 2005) and stress defense is mediated mostly by apoptosis as well as autophagy and necrosis (Farrugia and Balzan 2012).\nThe changes in INO1 and SSA4 genes are significant in both random positioning with gravity vector averaging and rotation techniques but oppositely directed to the space flight changes, underscoring the uniqueness of the effects of true microgravity. During culture on the ISS, yeast cultures are also exposed to increased radiation (Nislow et al. 2015). Our previous studies using yeast deletion series in liquid culture to evaluate the effects of space flight revealed two dominant responses: radiation/DNA repair and reactive oxygen pathways (Nislow et al. 2015). We conclude that the ISS provides a unique suite of stimuli with distinct set of responses: the question is how to translate these properties to i) further NASA’s program objectives, ii) support commercial development, and iii) address unmet clinical needs.  We found differences in the responses of yeast in the rotating wall vessel versus random positioning models in both ammonia-dependent and stress-dependent changes, providing clarity to the controversy as to whether the random positioning device is a form of rotation, or a distinct stimulus (Klaus 2001; Klaus et al. 2004). These differences included gene expression changes mediated by shear stress promoters, redox status, and apoptosis. Hence, we conclude that the forces induced by random positioning and rotation are distinct. Many resources are available for scientists seeking to study the effects of gravity on biologic systems (Brungs et al. 2016; Frett et al. 2016) and researchers should be mindful that fluidity of the culture milieu and shear stress at the membrane surface are likely to be important variables affecting how cells sense gravity (Kohn et al. 2017; van Loon 2008). In our model system composed of a near-solid colony of yeast, receiving nutrients from an agar gel at its base, and using a gas, ammonia, as one means of driving differentiation within the colony, space flight, rotating wall vessel and random positioning generate different effects. In free-floating liquid systems such as U937 cells growing in suspension (Bradamante et al. 2006), HUVEC cells adherent to Cytodex beads (Bradamante et al. 2006), or thyroid cells growing as spheroids (Warnke et al. 2016) rotating wall vessel, random positioning machines, and space flight had very similar effects.\nThe ability of physical methods to manipulate yeast colony redox, apoptosis, and stress defense status is important at multiple levels of organismal biology. Gene deletion, although targeted to a single locus, will often cause follow-on effects in multiple integrated pathways, especially when promoters are deleted (Park et al. 2011). Further, there are clinically important applications. Analysis of yeast survival pathways offers powerful techniques to address drug metabolic mechanisms for repurposing of pharmaceuticals (Lee et al. 2014), including identification of unique targets (Blackman et al. 2012) and buffering pathways required to respond to drugs. Further, yeast colony differentiation recapitulates many of the stratification mechanisms of tumorigenesis (Cap et al. 2012a, d; Birdsall et al. 2016). In conclusion, by allowing graded manipulation of a combination of convection and ammonia signaling, while avoiding secondary effects of gene deletion, these physical techniques are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.  The fourth step in this initiative was to determine the gene pathways, which mediate space based changes in giant yeast colony differentiation as a tumorogenesis model.\nOur data shows that space flight on the ISS appeared to have a unique pattern on DNA damage.  The logical next step is to combine this genome sequencing data with functional data in order to investigate the biological consequence(s) of deleting a particular genes and the subsequent accumulation of mutations.\nThe hypothesis to be tested is that yeast double deletion pools can be used to identify genes conferring resistance to space/cosmic radiation.\nThe traditional approach is to create double mutants that contain combinations of each mutation of interest (the query mutation) with a mutation in a second gene (Dixon et al., 2009).  This experimental approach exploits the phenomenon of synthetic lethality in which a combination of mutations in two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a mutation in only one of these genes is not, in itself, lethal.  Synthetic lethality is currently of great interest in the study of cancer.  Synthetic lethality can help us understand how cells become cancerous by overcoming the redundant cellular quality control mechanisms.  It can also be a potential way to selectively kill cancer cells by identifying drugs that can target and inactivate synthetic lethal genes that act in concert with cancer-driver genes. Our previous radiation work in space has not addressed synthetic lethality at all.\nWe generated double mutant libraries in which the mutated DNA repair gene (mutation #1) is paired with a homozygous deletion of another yeast gene (mutation #2).  Each pool contains approximately ˜ 4600 double-mutant strains, representing deletion of each of the nonessential genes in the yeast genome combined with mutation #1. In “fitness profiling” the mutants were grown and the relative quantity of each clone was measured (Roemer et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010).  The samples were flown cold to the ISS, allowed to grow while exposed to cosmic radiation on station, and returned to ground.  Recent innovations in sample preparation allowed us to fly these experiments at ambient temperatures, which required minimal crew input to initiate the experiment, and produced a small payload. Furthermore, because the experiment was limited by nutrient availability (e.g., the yeast grow until the nutrients are depleted then remain in a quiescent state), the experimental set up is a closed system that did not require any additional intervention or specialized post-experiment storage requirements. Finally, the generation of these double mutant pools provides sufficient stock material for ~5000 ground based follow-on experiments using the sample aliquots, and can be stored indefinitely.\nTo prepare the second mutation in each clone, both copies of each of the ˜ 4600 nonessential genes in the yeast genome is removed by genetic engineering.  The mutated clone is able to thrive so long as there is no external stressor targeting that particular gene’s protein.  However, in the presence of the stressor (e.g., cosmic radiation), the clone is overwhelmed and grows less well compared to clones with irrelevant mutations.  To discriminate the clones in the series, each clone’s deleted gene has been replaced with a unique DNA bar code.  The entire series can be grown together in the presence of the stressor, the DNA extracted, and the numbers of each clone quantified by high throughput sequencing or hybridization to gene chips (Smith et al., 2010).  The ‘clone-identifying’ barcode is unique to each clone, but the insert is flanked by up and down DNA sequences that are identical in every clone so that the extracted DNA for all clones can be amplified together.  All of the techniques proposed have been used and validated in space flight (Johanson et al., 2007; Nislow et al., 2015).\nMultiple double mutation pools were prepared corresponding to sentinel DNA-sensitive mutant strains. These pools were made robotically, rapidly, and inexpensively (Giaever and Nislow, 2014).    The result of the chemogenomic assay is a quantitative metric, termed \"fitness\", presented as a list of genes ranked in order of their importance for growth and survival in the presence versus the absence of the stressor (space flight/cosmic radiation vs ground).  Accordingly a ranked list of all genes in the genome was generated for each experiment and then compared using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to define those pathways and processes that were affected by growth in microgravity using Cytoscape (Wallace et al., 2011).\nDetecting differentially fit genes from next generation sequencing or microarray data involves a set of statistical tradeoffs. Standard methods look for genes by relying on elementary test statistics using data from one gene at a time (such as t-tests, or contrasts from ANOVA models). Gene lists are obtained by filtering statistics by attempting to control overall type-I error, or false discovery rate, or by filtering using a user specified cutoff level. The tradeoff between controlling Type I errors, due to the large number of comparisons, and maintaining power can be handled in a variety of ways. These methods include but are not limited to False Discovery Rate analysis including Storey statistics, Bayesian analysis, and many other mapping techniques.\nSpecific comparisons provide internal controls. We were able to identify most of the nonessential genes previously shown to be involved in nucleotide excision repair, in cell cycle checkpoints, in homologous recombination, and in post replication repair after other forms of radiation damage. This validates the space-based assay by acting as a positive control.\nSecond, comparison is being made of the ISS data to existing data sets in this model  on UV irradiation, alkayating radiomimetic agents, and our prior ISS data. Especially in the deletion pool using the wild type background, this should elucidate if the changes in space have unique pathways.\nThe experiments performed in space flight and ground-based controls directly address Human Research Program and Space Biology Science Plan's research goals, objectives, and guiding questions that underlie our project's unifying hypothesis: \"Microgravity-induced changes in yeast are induced, at least in part, through changes in density driven ammonia convection and the subsequent effects on Msn4- and Sfp1-dependent genetic and cellular differentiation of giant yeast colonies.\"  Each experiment is identifying specific target genes and the transcription factors that mediate the changes using reporter synthetic genetic array methodology or gene expression.\nThe Micro 9 experiment flew on SpaceX-8, spending one month on the ISS.  There were zero defects in either the ISS or parallel ground control experiments.  All four experiments included static and rotated ground controls.  Experiments 3 and 4, ground controls with a random positioning machine, were also conducted.\nExperiment 1.  Evaluate the role of ammonia and reactive oxygen species in the response to space flight using synthetic gene array technology.    \tThe yeast deletion series were prepared in a background of suppressed thioredoxin reductase activity (TRR1DAmp).  Thioredoxin reductase is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species.  Yeast deletion series were also prepared in a background of deleted SOK2, so that they are unable to synthesize ammonia, a key signaling molecule in the biochemical differentiation of giant yeast colonies.  Responses in these series were compared to yeast deletions series in a wild type background.\nIndividual clones were spotted on rich agar for fitness profiling.  Pools of each series were also spotted on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor agar as nutrient status affects generation of reactive oxygen species.  The agars were prepared with and without addition of the DNA-damaging agent 0.1 mM doxorubicin, as an additional stressor.\nExperiment 2:  Evaluate the response to space flight with radiation-sensitive clones.    \tEach of the 26 rad deletion addresses a different DNA damage response with different specific target gene and transcription factor responses in ground-based studies.\nExperiment 3: Evaluate the role of Sfp1 and Msn4 transcription factors in the expression of SSA4 and RPL34B by giant yeast colonies grown in real and emulated microgravity.  \teGFP-expressing SSa4 (YER103W) and  RPL34B clones with and without deletion of Msn4 & Sfp1 transcription factors were used.  RPL34B and SSa4 were selected because  we had previously found that their dependence on Msn4 and Sfp1 is altered in microgravity in liquid cultures.  Specific clones were:  Ssa4 (YER103W); Sfp1 delta Ssa4; Msn4 delta Ssa4; RPL34B (YIL052c); Sfp1 delta RPL34B; Msn4 delta RPL34B.  Yeast were evaluated for shear stress gene expression, cell death, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry.\nExperiment 4:  Evaluate the expression of genes in giant yeast colonies grown in real and simulated microgravity.    \teGFP-expressing yeast clones were spotted on nutrient rich and nutrient poor agar.  Yeast were evaluated for shear stress gene expression, cell death, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry.\nThe rationale for the clones selected is as follows:  ATO3, INO1, SSA4, and RPL34b are known to be upregulated in different strata as yeast differentiate into giant colonies in ground studies.  BEM1 was included as an index of bud scarring, which is known to be altered in liquid cultures of yeast in space flight.  TRR1 was included because giant colony differentiation on the ground and in rotation is accompanied by changes in redox and TRR1 is the key control enzyme in production of glutathione, the most abundant thiol buffering cellular reactive oxygen species.  EDC3 was included as it is often constitutively expressed, proving a control for a field change effect.\nFor all samples, DNA has been extracted, the reporting bar codes have been amplified by PCR, and sequencing libraries prepared.  Next generation sequencing has been completed, as has initial analyses by Gene Set enrichment Analysis (GSEA).  Visualization and probability modeling by Cytoscape and ClueGO is ongoing.\nAll OMICS data will be annotated and deposited in the NASA GeneLab portal.\nReferences\nAyer, A., Gourlay, C.W., Dawes, I.W.: Cellular redox homeostasis, reactive oxygen species and replicative ageing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

A role of the vacuole in controlling gravity perception is well accepted, but the molecular mechanisms by which the vacuole interacts with amyloplasts or regulates their sedimentation during gravitropism are yet to be identified. We recently uncovered a novel vacuole phenotype in agravitropic mutant alleles of VTI11 in Arabidopsis. We predict that this vacuole phenotype of vti11 mutants has negative effects on the organization of actin cables or the cortical endoplasmic reticulum, and therefore prevents amyloplast sedimentation. In addition, we have uncovered a novel regulation of vacuolar membrane fusion by phosphoinositides. Based on our results, we developed the hypothesis that mechanisms of vacuole remodeling that are mediated by phosphoinositide signaling are critical for the perception or transduction of the gravitropic signal in plants. A unique assay for vacuole fusion that we developed will be used to determine the role of specific cellular components in membrane fusion and gravity perception. The specific aims of this research project are to: 1) Determine subcellular phenotypes that impair gravity perception in itt3/vti11. 2) Identify the role of phosphoinositides in gravitropism.  3) Determine the role of the Adaptor Protein (AP-3) complex on vacuole biogenesis and gravitropism.\nOverall, this research will improve our understanding of vacuole biogenesis, the interactions between the vacuole and other cellular components involved in gravity perception, and the role of phosphoinosidides in gravitropism.",

The proposed ISS-MO establishment will lead to long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics, addressing recommendation P1 of this solicitation. It will also provide answers to NASA Space Biology Guiding Questions CMM-1, CMM-4, and CMM-5.\nThe ISS-MO project's methodology will serve as the foundation for an extensive microbial census, offering significant insight into spaceflight-induced changes in the populations of beneficial and potentially harmful microbes. Additionally, it will provide NASA with both a mechanistic understanding of these changes (e.g., cataloging population changes and mapping/linking these to environmental niche and genomic changes), as well as insight into practical countermeasures for mitigating risks to humans and environmental systems.\nThe ISS-MO team will use existing ISS sample collection technologies to generate an initial microbial census. Following their return to Earth, samples from the various ISS modules will be analyzed using standardized technologies from the Mars Program-funded projects.\nThe proposed ISS-MO project includes the delivery of a database that compiles the genomic sequences and genetic information for all the microbes encountered within the ISS habitat. Using this data, NASA can more accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to providing microbial profiles, the ISS-MO team will identify which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health. Furthermore, specific ISS-MO project aims will enable us to resolve applicable NASA-Human Research Program integrated research plan risks.",

Subsequent microbiological analyses using traditional methods noticed no anomaly and were also not able to predict the causative microbial agents. The next-generation sequencing study provided NASA with the ability to assess the spectrum of microorganisms associated with the ISS surfaces and would help to predict possible microbial agents that might affect crew health. The results of the present study also exhibited presence of representative human associated (skin, gastrointestinal track, wounds, etc.) bacterial commensals and opportunistic fungal pathogens. Furthermore, based on the phylogenetic affiliation it is possible to determine whether these viable microorganisms are hardy and robust that have been previously reported to survive in oligotrophic environments (cleanrooms, hospital, commercial airliner, etc.).

            "task_progress": "Objectives. The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo and crew, that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. The NASA Space Biology program funded a study to catalogue ISS environmental microbiome (Microbial Tracking – 1; MT-1). Several defined locations were systematically collected from 3 consecutive flights and microbial census was generated using advanced molecular microbial community analysis “omics” techniques, supported by traditional culture-based methods. Similarly, an Inflated Lunar/Mars Analog Habitat as a ground control system and SpaceX CRS (Commercial Resupply Service) vehicles to trace source of any possible contamination were examined and results presented. The 3-year funded 5 year time period of the MT-1 experiments was completed and the information produced would serve as the foundation for an extensive microbial census, offering significant insight into spaceflight-induced changes in the populations of beneficial and potentially harmful microbes. The safety of crewmembers and the maintenance of hardware are the primary goals for monitoring microorganisms in this closed habitat.\nThis study provides the first comprehensive catalogue of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries. The outcomes of the MT-1 microbiome study presented here may enable the development of suitable countermeasure technologies allowing to eradicate problematic microorganisms for human habitation in space and in confined built environments on Earth (e.g., medical, pharmaceutical, and spacecraft cleanrooms). These data sets were placed in the NASA GeneLab that is open to the scientific research community to encourage innovation.",

We will expose the well-characterized Aspergillus nidulans fungus under microgravity, which has already been shown to produce biotherapeutic compounds on Earth conditions in support of the development of pharmaceuticals (e.g., anti-osteoporosis agents). When demonstrated for the production of biotherapeutics in space, such an approach will potentially benefit astronauts during longer missions and enhance utilization of the International Space Station (ISS) for future pharmaceuticals development in space.\nThe IMPAS project seeks to answer the follow hypothetical question: Since Aspergillus nidulans exhibited production of antibiotics on Earth, do these fungal cells yield useful biotherapeutic secondary metabolites when grown in stressed microgravity conditions? Metabolomic characterization of both flight and ground control specimens will answer this question, which may lead to the discovery of potentially useful biotherapeutic compounds.\nThe IMPAS team will use the well-characterized model filamentous fungi A. nidulans to test the hypothesis. The team will characterize the profile of wild-type A. nidulans and three different mutant strains. The first is a strain deficient in nonhomologous end joining, an important mechanism for DNA damage repair. The second contains a deletion in a gene involved in the epigenetic regulation of secondary metabolites. The third features an overexpression of the gene for a global regulator of secondary metabolism, LaeA. The team will study the effect of microgravity on the production of fungal metabolites, as well as test the hypothesis that spaceflight alters fungal gene regulation, resulting in changes in metabolite production. Once the fungi are returned to Earth, state-of-the art molecular tools will be used to characterize the “omics” of these organisms.\nThe broad, long-term goal of this project is to study the changes encountered in various aspects of fungal “omics” under microgravity, as well as the production of fungal secondary metabolites. Natural products discovered from traditional discovery programs, such as lovastatin (a polyketide by Aspergillus terreus) and penicillin (a nonribosomally synthesized peptide by Penicillium chrysogenum), have demonstrated that filamentous fungi are a rich source of chemotherapeutic agents against a variety of diseases. Genome sequencing of various natural product-producing organisms have shown that, even in well-characterized organisms like A. nidulans and A. terreus, the biosynthesis pathways of the vast majority of natural products are still unknown, largely because they are silent until specific conditions trigger their expression. Research from Clay Wang’s (Principal Investigator) laboratory and others have shown that in filamentous fungi secondary metabolite production is highly sensitive to growth conditions. In addition, the IMPAS team has shown that many secondary metabolism pathways are triggered specifically in harsh or stressful conditions. Thus, hidden within these fungal genomes is a treasure trove of natural products yet to be discovered.\nThe proposed IMPAS project will address the effects of microgravity and the space environment on fungal growth and physiological responses in spaceflight (P1 and P2). The relevant Space Biology guiding questions for the IMPAS project are: CMM-1c (alteration in gravity affects microbial replication including genetic and metabolic regulation); CMM-4 (does the enhanced secondary metabolite production or other genetic changes observed occur in fungal species?); and CMM-5 (physiological responses to spaceflight).",

In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the SM global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and SM biosynthesis was observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism.

            "task_description": "This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.\nIn a corollary set of experiments, we are utilizing next generation sequencing techniques to assess the effects of long term exposure to radiation on the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in a variety of model systems. The most comprehensive view of this process has come from yeast which, owing to the conservation of this essential pathway, shares homologs of their human DNA repair counterparts. A key observation from our group and others is that different types of DNA damage require unique repair genes and proteins. Accordingly,  we are studying the cellular response to energetic particle radiation experienced in space using whole genome sequencing of thousands of yeast cells exposed to a large matrix of space-specific conditions.\nWe hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.\nThe proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station (ISS); (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data; (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.\nTo test our hypothesis, we will:\n1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated microgravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.\n2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated microgravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme that is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.\n3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground-based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force.",

The long term goal is to use this information to unveil drug metabolism pathways in the unique metabolic environment provided by microgravity.\nWe propose to establish a sustained genomics platform on the ISS to understand the long term effects of the radiation, and other features of the ISS environment, on crew health by dissecting the essential processes of DNA damage and DNA repair. This has broad Earth benefits in understanding effects and optimization of medically necessary radiation therapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents.\nThe APEX-02-2 work  quantitatively measures radiation damage to yeast DNA exposed to space radiation. Using state of the art technologies, the science team can, for the first time, conduct a highly powered, genome wide analysis of mechanisms of radiation damage in space. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating space based radiation damage.\nBy using yeast strains to understand the effects of space based radiation stresses at the cellular level, a greater knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms at work in cells will be gained. A hallmark of radiation stresses is that they induce physiological responses; primary among them are DNA damage. As yeast is a model eukaryotic organism, DNA damage changes caused by radiation could lead to a greater understanding of these processes on Earth, thus benefiting all citizens. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating clinical radiation damage.\nYeast deletion project is a project to create data for a near-complete collection of gene-deletion mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each strain carries a precise deletion of one of the genes in the genome, and has been functionally characterized. We have now cloned the 6,000+ strains of the yeast deletion series into the background of 10 separate deletion clones of genes known to play a major role in responses to radiation damage."

We have been able to determine specific target genes and mechanistic pathways determining them, including transcription factors, in a variety of space based models using background deletion of several radiation protection genes, as well as stimulation of the system with multiple drugs. In particular, we can now address whether metformin, a drug originally utilized in diabetes, but shown to have cancer protective properties, may be a useful radiation countermeasure.

            "task_description": "Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.\nPlants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development, and reduces yield.\nIn animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).\nIn all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast (8-10) and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.\nWe believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.\nWe also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.\nWe also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.\nIn conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.\nREFERENCES\n1.

These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to a variety of plant cellular stress responses. We successfully completed both of the preflight tests (science verification test (SVT) and experiment verification test (EVT)) to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the plant samples returned from BRIC-22. On August 14, 2017 our experiment was launched on board the SpaceX-12 ISS resupply mission and was successfully executed by ISS astronauts. The samples were preserved on orbit and underwent atmospheric reentry on board the same Dragon capsule in September of 2017. At the same time a duplicate of the experiment was grown at the Kennedy Space Center using temperature conditions which were matched to the flight conditions. We extracted RNA from both sets of samples and performed RNA sequencing in order to better understand what genes would be turned on and off specifically by spaceflight conditions in wild type plants and our mutant plants. We observed changes in the way that thousands of genes were activated in response to these conditions between flight and ground conditions and are submitting our results for peer review.\nMeanwhile, further research on these stress regulating genes and the Arabidopsis mutants that were tested in BRIC-22 is also being completed in continuing ground-based studies. Through a better understanding of these gene’s function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses.",

Furthermore, we have shown that these transgenic mice, mCAT mice, had reduced oxidative damage in the bone compared to the wild type (WT) littermate after spaceflight simulation treatment.

We tested various antioxidants diets, antioxidant injections, anti-inflammatory injections, and dried plum diet. We have shown that the dried plum diet completely prevents radiation-induced bone loss, most probably by reducing the early pro-osteoclast cytokines signaling, and protecting the osteoprogenitors bone forming cells.\n(b) In vitro protection of bone forming osteoblasts from radiation. We tested various antioxidants to protect osteoblasts from radiation, and found that superoxide dismutase (SOD) protects osteoblasts from low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) such as gamma irradiation, but not from high-LET irradiation such as Iron. This provides a platform to look at the differences in terms of oxidative damage and DNA damage between low-LET and high-LET irradiation.\nIn summary, all our data provides further insight in the mechanisms of spaceflight-induced bone loss and we found a potential novel radiomitigant.",

NOTE 12/11/2017: Continuation of \"Novel Explorations Into the Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--NNX12AO65G,\" per PI move from University of Mississippi to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.]\nThe major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.\nThese experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will be launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.\nA significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Studying the effects of gravity and light on basic cellular mechanisms in plants, this project is relevant to the emphasis on using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system in developmental biology. Since plants will be a necessary part of bioregenerative life support needed to send humans to Mars and beyond, the knowledge obtained from our spaceflight experiments will be critical for developing ways to effectively use plants in the bioregenerative life support systems. These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth."

            "task_description": "A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increase susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.\nIn short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in \"Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration\" including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA (NASA Research Announcement).",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.\nUnderstanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. For example, loss of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma is a commonality abound spaceflight/disuse, aging, Type 2 diabetes, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oxidative stress appears to be at the root of nNOSµ loss in theses muscle myopathies.  Out laboratory seeks to understand the underlying redox mechanisms that leader to perturbation in nNOS function and thus myopathy."

            "task_progress": "Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that adapts rapidly to changes in mechanical loading by altering its cross-sectional area and mass. The reduced mechanical loading of spaceflight causes postural muscles in the lower extremities and flexors in the upper extremities to lose fiber cross-sectional area and force-generating capacity. Muscle atrophy and weakness may then impede mission objectives, increase the risk of injury, and increase susceptibility to damage upon reloading. Muscular alterations with spaceflight are therefore a critical limitation to performance during spaceflight missions and a serious health concern for astronauts.\nExcessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is considered an important component of muscle myopathy with unloading. ROS are produced from the mitochondria and non-phagocytic NADPH-oxidases (NOX) in skeletal muscle fibers and thought to contribute to atrophy through activation of proteolytic pathways. In addition, ROS may initiate a signaling pathway that results in disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-complex (DGC). The DGC serves as an interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix and is responsible for the detection and transmittance of load necessary for regulation of various cellular processes. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others indicates that ROS-induced atrophy is related to disruption of the DGC and translocation of the mu(µ)-splice variant of nNOS from the sarcolemma into the cytosol. nNOSµ is then thought to directly stimulate FoxO3a and ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1, atrogin-1), leading to muscle fiber atrophy.\nThe purpose of this investigation is to identify oxidant-related mechanisms that lead to disruption of the DGC, translocation nNOSµ, proteolysis, and thus atrophy. Our central hypothesis is that ROS, produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria, cause translocation of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis and suppressing protein synthesis. Our experimental design consists of a series of studies utilizing a rodent hindlimb unloading model of spaceflight to: (1) identify NOX dependent signaling of nNOS translocation, FoxO3a activation, and muscle fiber atrophy, and (2) determine the redox regulatory role in DGC disruption with mechanical unloading and atrophy. In addition, additional investigation has been commenced to better translate these findings to spaceflight, where we have begun to use pharmaceutical (Losartan) and nutraceutical (fish oil + curcumin) interventions to limit unloading-induced atrophy.\nData that has been collected thus far indicates that: (1) administration of a potent antioxidant, the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134, prevents unloading induced atrophy during a short-term (54  hr) unloading protocol. Reduced atrophy was related to decreased expression of NOX subunits, ROS production, and markers of ROS-related signaling/damage. In addition, nNOS translocation was prevented with EUK-134 administration as well as related activation of proteolysis through FoxO3a dephosphorylation; (2) EUK-134 also prevented unloading induced atrophy during a longer 7-day unloading protocol, an effect also related to decreased ROS production and nNOS translocation as well as activation of anabolic pathways; (3) More specific targeting of ROS production by using a NOX-2 inhibitor, gp91 ds-tat, and mitochondrial ROS inhibitor, SS-31, has also resulted in reduced muscle fiber atrophy following a 7-day unloading protocol. Interestingly, an interaction between these two sources of ROS has also been suggested with our pilot data; and lastly, (4) pharmaceutical inhibition of angiotensin II receptor I (AT1R), and (5) a nutraceutical interventions with fish oil + curcumin, respectively, have demonstrated similar results.\nIn summary, inhibition of ROS appears to be effective in limiting skeletal muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading. Inhibition of ROS is related to augmented anabolic and reduced catabolic signaling as well as translocation of nNOS, and the source of ROS production may be from both the mitochondria and Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase. Future studies will focus on finalizing the 7-day EUK-134 interventional study including measurement of fractional synthesis rate; further delineating the mechanisms responsible for reduced atrophy with peptidyl inhibition of ROS using gp91ds-tat to target Nox2 and SS-31 to target mitochondria. We will also utilize a genetic ablation of Nox2 (gp91phox-/-) to further establish its role in unloading induced atrophy; and establishing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical interventions in preventing unloading-induced atrophy. In addition, fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and rate of protein degradation will be assessed in future experiments.",

            "task_description": "The spaceflight environment influences immune cell distribution, ex vivo responses to antigen, and cytokine expression. However, few studies have characterized the impact of the spaceflight environment on the host immune response following an in vivo immune challenge, particularly those involving B cells and antibody production. The International Space Station (ISS) provides an ideal laboratory within which investigators can explore this unique environment and its impact on the host response. Through the use of a mouse model (with an immune system that closely parallels that of humans), we will establish a link between exposure to the spaceflight environment and decrements in immune system activation. This study is significant because it will directly test the hypothesis that host immunological health will be compromised in space.\nOn-orbit Flight Activities, Procedures, and Timeline\nMice will receive health checks upon unloading and transfer from the Transporter to the Habitat after capsule docking no later than 24 hrs after hatch opening. Animal health will then be monitored daily via continuous video recording from one camera at a time from all of the Habitats on-orbit (including other investigations which may be running concurrently) and down-linked to Ames science staff. Ground personnel shall have the option of programming or manually controlling which camera is being down-linked and recorded at any given time. Water levels will be checked every 3-4 days. After a minimum of 14 days after animal transfer from the Transporter to the Habitat, all 20 mice will be moved to the MSG and receive intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle (5 mice), Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine (5 mice), CpG ODN adjuvant (5 mice), or TT vaccine + CpG ODN adjuvant (5 mice). The dose of TT and/or CpG ODN will be 10 microg/ mouse and 40 microg/ mouse, respectively.  Pre-mixed doses will be prepared preflight in 100 microl saline and stored at -20 to -30°C until the appropriate time point. All injections and blood draws will use a 1 mL 26G 3/8” tuberculin syringe.  All injections will be i.p.\nBefore use, the CpG adjuvant must be stored at -20°C or colder until use and the TT vaccine must be stored at 4°C. At 14 +/- 2 days after injection, mice will be transferred to the MSG and sacrificed via an i.p. injection of 100/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine mixture, followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately following the blood collection, the spleens from the mice will be removed, sectioned into halves, and placed in a frozen environment (minimum temperature -80°C) until returned to Earth. Following spleen collection, the remains of the mouse carcass will be wrapped in tin foil, put in a zip-lock bags and placed in a -80°C environment (or colder) to preserve the tissues for future biospecimen sharing. Blood must not be allowed to sit at ambient temperature for longer than 1 hour post-collection; if operational requirements require the blood collected to be stored in excess of 1 hour before centrifugation, the blood must be transferred to a 4°C environment until centrifugation, for a period not to exceed 4 hours. Blood collected will be separated into solid and serum/plasma fractions by centrifugation and frozen at -80°C until returned to Earth. Storage times for both spleen and blood of up to 6 months at -80°C are acceptable.\nTime\nActivity &\nEstimated Time Required\nThermal Req.\nComments, Location &\nSpecial Considerations\nLaunch to L + 45 days\nAnimal health checks via video monitoring; water    level checks every 3-4 days\n20 – 30°C\nVideo downlink required for health checks\nTransfer to Habitat + 14 d\nAll 20 mice will be transferred to habitat\n20 – 30°C\nRequires transfer to and from Habitat with MTB;\nInjection + 14d +/- 2 d\nAt specific time points, all 20 mice will be    removed from AEM and given appropriate injection\n20 – 30°C / -80°C\nRequired transfer to MSG for injections\nDissection + 0 d\nMice euthanized, blood drawn and centrifuged and    spleen sectioned and frozen.

Habitats will be kept at a regular 12hr:12hr day:night light cycle to match the day/night programmed to be synchronous with the crew’s day/night cycle upon arrival. Water refill of habitats shall be performed. To prevent rodent food bars from becoming too hard or soiled, they will be replaced with a fresh food bar plate (from 4°C storage) at a time to not exceed 30 days after the introduction of mice to a Habitat.\nGround Activities Accompanying On-orbit Activities and Timeline\nGround controls will be run following spaceflight environmental parameters in orbital environmental simulator(s) (OES) chambers at KSC ACF. Delay between launch and start of environmental controls may be up to 8 days, depending on the logistics and capability of the telemetry system. Mice will be housed in flight Habitats with RFB diet and lixit water to match on-orbit groups. The operations done on ground will be conducted to match the same relative time points during the day/night cycle of the animals on-orbit, so that procedures on ground control mice are conducted at the same points in the animals’ circadian rhythm.\nEach experimental group for ground controls will be doubled to improve the statistical significance of the experiment with a total of 40 mice (4 groups of 10). Therefore, 2 Transporters will be required for the flight in orbital environmental simulator(s) (OES) that have been programmed with telemetry data from the flight. At the same relative time point (accounting for delay in starting ground controls after flight) the mice are transferred from the Transporter to the Habitat, the 40 ground control mice will be transferred from the 2 Transporters into 4 Habitats, and maintained in OES programmed with telemetry data from the ISS. OES shall be programmed to mimic the following conditions experienced by the Transport and then the Habitat: CO2, O2, temperature, and humidity.\nInjection and dissection must be performed as close as possible to how they are done on-orbit. In particular, the time of day that mice are sacrificed and dissected on the ground should match the same point in the circadian rhythms of the mice on-orbit. However, dissections or ground control mice can be conducted on standard laboratory benches/tables with chairs that are more ergonomic to the operators. For ground controls, dissection pins or needles may be used to pin down mice for dissection, as can spray bottles of wetting the mice before dissection. Flight hardware is required when it may affect the tissue dissection or preservation, such as having flight cold blocks in mini cold bags for tissue freezing.\nMice will receive health checks daily via video in the Habitat and water levels will be checked every 3-4 days. After a minimum of 14 days in the OES, all 40 mice will receive an i.p. injection of vehicle (10 mice), TT vaccine (10 mice), CpG adjuvant (10 mice), or TT vaccine + CpG adjuvant (10 mice). At 14 +/- 2 days after injection, mice will be sacrificed via an i.p. injection of 100/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine mixture, followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately following the blood collection, the spleens from the mice will be removed, sectioned into halves, and placed in a frozen environment (minimum temperature -80°C) until returned to Earth. Duration for which blood is stored at ambient or 4°C shall be matched as closely as possible to the timelines the same procedures will be performed on-orbit. Blood collected will be separated into solid and serum/plasma fractions by centrifugation and frozen at -80°C until returned to the laboratory of the PI. Storage times for both spleen and blood of up to 6 months at -80°C are acceptable.\nTime\nActivity\nThermal Req.\nComments, Justification, Special Considerations\nBeginning of ground controls to +45 days\nAnimal health checks; water level checks every 3-4 days\n20 –    30\no\nC\nVideo downlink required for health checks\nTBD, depending on delay in ground controls and    on-orbit timelines\nAt specific time points, all 40 mice will be    removed from AEM and given appropriate injection\n20 – 30\no\nC\nTransfer from cages to a regular lab bench and    back w/ standard cages.\nTBD, depending on delay in ground controls and    on-orbit timelines\nMice euthanized, blood drawn and centrifuged and    spleen sectioned and frozen\n-80\no\nC\nProcessing of blood in a centrifuge, and storage    of samples at -80\no\nC",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "According to the National Institute of Aging (NIA), “Life expectancy nearly doubled during the 20th century with a ten-fold increase in the number of Americans age 65 or older.”  Furthermore, “there are approximately 35 million Americans age 65 or older, and this number is expected to double in the next 25 years.” Consequently, there is a rapidly growing need to understand the mechanisms underlying age-associated illness. Indeed, in the last decade, research has repeatedly demonstrated an impact of aging on immune function. Low-grade increases in circulating inflammatory cytokine secretion are often associated with senescence. Furthermore, studies suggest that these disruptions are likely due to decrements in cellular repair mechanisms and/or increases in antigenic load. Given this disruption in immune function, it is perhaps not surprising that many of the diseases associated with aging — such as type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease — have strong inflammatory underpinnings.\nThere are strong indications that the physiological effects of spaceflight are also similar to those seen in senescence. For instance, evidence suggests that age-associated enhancements in inflammatory cytokines are linked to changes in adipose tissue and energy balance. Similar links between metabolism, adipose tissue, and inflammation have also been shown to manifest in astronauts and animal models after exposure to spaceflight.  We propose to use long-term exposure to the spaceflight environment to model the effects of aging on immune function. Although these initial studies involve mice, the next obvious step in this work will be to work directly with astronauts.  Because astronauts tend to be extremely healthy, these effects will not be influenced by confounding factors such as clinically relevant, age-related disease. Also, because the effects of spaceflight on immunity are temporary, generally returning to baseline levels post-flight, this will ultimately give us some insight into whether or not the effects of aging are, indeed, reversible.\nAlthough many different aspects of immune function are influenced by both aging and spaceflight, these experiments will focus on B cells and the generation of antibodies.  Specifically, we will use next generation RNA sequencing techniques to characterize the B cell Ig heavy chain in animals that are challenged with tetanus toxoid.  The Ig heavy chain is the component of antibodies responsible for identifying specific sections of the tetanus toxoid, thereby coordinating subsequent immune responses.  Comparisons will be made between the B cell repertoires generated on ISS and on Earth.  The changes in B cell Ig heavy chain usage will provide indications whether the spaceflight environment affects the B cells that respond to antigen.  This, in turn, will help us understand the impact of aging on B cell function.\nWe anticipate that we will obtain several data sets which have relevance to spaceflight and/or have general significance to understanding host immune responsiveness.  These data include:   1)\tData that show that spaceflight either maintains or alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts;     2)\tInformation that demonstrates how immunization with an immunogen, commonly used in human medicine, alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts in the absence of the spaceflight variable;    3)\tDeterminations how activation of B cells through Tlr9 receptors alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts.\nWe will ascertain if activation of B cells through Tlr9 receptors can reverse any impact that may occur during spaceflight."

            "task_progress": "Project History and Review of Specific Aims\nThis project was submitted and funded in response to the NASA Research Announcement NNH12ZTT001N: Research Opportunities in Space Biology. This multidisciplinary project was to include three independent investigators and two institutions (Loma Linda University/LLU and Kansas State University/KSU, in addition to NASA). Since then, due to a series of unpredictable events, this project has evolved to include a number of ground-based analog studies, multiple analyses of flight tissues, and an actual flight study. We designated this experiment as Tetanus Antibody Response from B-cells In Space (TARBIS).\nThe original project involved three different experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to characterize different aspects of the antibody response. We proposed to immunize mice with the established tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine. This would allow us to generate an antigen-specific antibody response in our mouse model while using a clinically-relevant antigen. Our goal was to determine the impact of the spaceflight environment on primary and secondary antibody responses. C57BL/6J mice were challenged with a TT vaccine either before launch or during their stay on the ISS, as appropriate. Blood and spleen were to be collected in orbit from mice 2 weeks after primary or secondary immunization. Vaccination and assessment schedules would have been matched in ground-based controls. The antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatment groups.\nDue to the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and a greater-than 2-year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved in 2015 to modify the aims of NNX13AN34G to include a Flight Definition Phase. Much of the work between 2015 and 2018 involved completing the Flight Definition phase work and publishing the results. In 2017-2018, we requested a funding augmentation and began preparations for our spaceflight mission. As this process evolved, two of our originally proposed experiments were combined into one flight experiment. During this period a Co-Investigator, Dr. Keith Chapes, announced that he would be retiring from KSU. With his retirement, all experimental operations were moved to LLU. Previously, this work was completed at KSU in Dr. Chapes’ lab. Dr. Chapes continued his role as a Co-I as an independent consultant. In 2019, this experiment flew as TARBIS/Rodent Research-12. In the years between 2019 and the present, we were involved with a number of other flight-related opportunities, including several Biospecimen Sharing Program dissections and RR-18.  Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted and delayed multiple activities during this period.     Flight Definition Phase Work\n1. Analysis of spleen tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research - 1 (RR-1) verification flight.\nWe analyzed spleen RNA from these tissues (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 ground controls). We have determined IgH usage of the spleen B cells in these mice (flight vs. ground controls). We also generated total RNASeq on the RNA to have a matching data set to the liver RNASeq that is being done by the NASA GeneLab.\nWe analyzed GeneLab sequencing data that was available from the GeneLab database (GLDS-47, GLDS-48). The number of immunoglobulin reads (either heavy or light chain) were quite low, less than 1% of what we had obtained in preliminary analysis of spleen cells and tissue. We first attributed this low yield to short sequencing reads from the HiSeq sequencing method that Genelab did and provided in the database. Therefore, we sequenced both splenic (funded by another grant) and liver RNA from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) validation flight, which was made available by the NASA Ames Research Center (n=3 ground, n=3 flight). RNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (300bp, 2x) at the Kansas State Integrated Genomics Facility. Sequencing data was quality trimmed using CLC Genomics Workbench and mapped to reference libraries obtained from the  ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database. Data sets were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for Complementarity Determining Region 3 (CDR3) characterization.\nThe analysis of liver (quantified as part of the tissue sharing grant, NNX15AB45G) vs. spleen (quantified as part of THIS grant) reads indicated that liver immunoglobulin gene reads range from 0.26% of spleen immunoglobulin gene reads to 0.91%. The number of reads ranges from less than 100 to no greater than 622, depending on the sample. Although useful, publishable data from the spleen can be obtained (preliminary data presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) and presented in the GeneLab workshop by Chapes and Ward), the liver sequencing will not provide meaningful immunoglobulin gene data, even when the more comprehensive MiSeq next generation sequencing (NGS) platform is used to sequence. The liver data won’t be of any value and will not fulfill our goal of doing tissue comparisons. Other data from the MiSeq NGS data sets will be useful for other data mining attempts and will be made available to the GeneLab. Therefore, these sequencing runs allowed us to narrow our focus and not waste time on liver analyses. [Ed. Note: For information on the tissue sharing grant, see NASA Grant # NNX15AB45G; PI: Chapes. For ASGSR and other References, see the Cumulative Bibliography for this project.]\n2. An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight.\nIn this protocol, mice were subjected to AOS. Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways: phosphate buffer saline (PBS), unmethylated cytosine–guanine dinucleotide motifs (CpG), tetanus toxoid (TT), and TT with CpG. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we sacrificed the mice and collected a variety of tissues for further analysis. These are the same treatment groups that were proposed for our ISS studies. We used female C57BL/6J mice, 10-12 weeks old at the start of unloading. Independent variables were Tetanus Toxoid, CpG adjuvant, and hindlimb unloading. Blood and spleen were analyzed as part of this grant (NNX13AN34G). Assays at Loma Linda University included blood, TT specific IgG, IgA, IgM, and non-specific Ig levels. Kansas State University completed analyzing the IgH & IgK repertoire based on RNAseq.\nThe AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during spaceflight (Chapes, Mastro et al. 1993). [Ed. Note: See References.] Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 (5 mice per treatment group); Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 (5 mice per treatment group). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS. Two weeks later, the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways: PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG. Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we sacrificed the mice and collected a variety of tissues. This protocol was followed so that when mice were flown to the ISS, we would have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables. Serum, spleen, liver, and bone marrow were collected specifically to compare with our flight project.\nBriefly, we were able to confirm that i.p. injections – as opposed to the more typical intramuscular (i.m.) injection for vaccines – of TT resulted in an antibody response and that this response was augmented by an order of magnitude when mice were also given the CpG adjuvant. However, AOS had little impact on the ability to generate TT-specific antibodies, at least in the blood. AOS increased circulating corticosterone levels and a number of cytokines/chemokines, including GCSF, IL-1a, IL-5, IL-6, IP-10, and KC.\nImpact of AOS on the Spleen Ig Repertoire\nWe explored the impact of skeletal unloading using the AOS model and mice were experimentally challenged with TT and/or the adjuvant CpG. AOS did alter constant gene usage, resulting in higher levels of IgM and lower levels of IgG. CpG also altered constant gene region usage, increasing usage of IgA. Significant changes could be detected in multiple V-, D-, and J-gene segments in both the heavy and light chains in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatments. Analysis of class-switched-only transcripts revealed a different pattern of V-gene segment usage than detected in the whole repertoire and also showed significant alterations in gene segment usage after challenge. Alterations in V/J pairing were also detected in response to challenge. CDR3 amino acid sequence overlaps were similar among treatment groups, though the addition of CpG lowered overlap in the heavy chain. We isolated 3,045 whole repertoire and 98 potentially TT-specific CDR3 sequences for the heavy chain and 569 for the light chain. Our results demonstrate that AOS alters the repertoire response to challenge with TT and/or CpG.\nImpact of AOS on the Bone Marrow Ig Repertoire\nIn the same AOS experiment, the bone marrow antibody repertoire was characterized – including V-, D- (heavy only), and J-gene segment usage, constant region usage, CDR3 length, and V(D)J combinations. We detected changes in gene-segment usage in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatment in both the heavy and light chains of bone marrow B cells. Additionally, changes were seen in the class-switched VH-gene repertoire. Alterations were also detected in V/J pairing for both the heavy and light chains, and changes CDR3 length. We also detected lower levels of CDR3 AA overlap than detected in the splenic repertoire. These results demonstrate that AOS, TT, and CpG alter the bone marrow antibody repertoire; however, it is still unclear from both the spleen and the bone marrow data whether there is a loss of host antigen-specific responsiveness because of the change in gene use.\nMiSeq analysis of the spleen was completed at KSU. Originally, we had intended to perform a similar analysis of the liver. However, as described above, this analysis was ineffective and we opted to analyze bone marrow instead. In addition, we characterized changes in circulating corticosterone and found that AOS led to a significant increase. Furthermore, we noted a trend for the AOS response to be augmented in TT treated mice.\nAlthough the tissue analyses were slightly different from those described in the original proposal, the aim of doing multiple tissue assessments/comparisons was accomplished. This is a high-science return. We also believe that results from these studies will augment the data from the flight experiments, confirming the efficacy of AOS as a model for spaceflight for immune endpoints.\n3. NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Anti-orthostatic Suspension Experiment in Collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Blaber.\nDue to the nature of the studies described above, we were unable to use the blood or spleen tissue collected in the LLU experiments described above to characterize the impact of unloading on WBC populations. Furthermore, the funding and flight requirements for our flight project did not allow us to compare male vs. female mice. Fortuitously, the opportunity arose to look at blood populations in a study with a design similar to our own. This project involved Elizabeth Blaber, Ph.D. at Ames Research Center. [Ed. Note: See Space Biology projects under PI: Blaber in the NASA Task Book.]\nThe focus of Dr. Blaber’s study was to study the impact of p21 on bone, muscle, and stem cells. Male and female mice were suspended for 15 or 30 days (the latter timepoint is very similar to the 28 day unloading in our AOS studies). At the appropriate timepoint, mice were sacrificed and tissues were collected immediately. We characterized blood populations using an ABC Vet automatic hematology analyzer. In addition, we collected adrenals, brain, cerebellum, eye, liver, and skin tissue and froze them in liquid nitrogen. Although we were primarily interested in the wild type controls for this study, we collected tissues from both wild type controls and the p21 knockout mice.\nOur analyses of the blood indicated that unloading decreased all of the major leukocyte population counts. This decrease was generally more pronounced in the lymphocyte subset than in the other populations. Female mice tended to have higher cell counts than males, but there was no significant unloading x sex interaction on any subset. Finally, counts were similar between wild-type controls and p21 knockouts for all populations.\n4. Tetanus Toxoid Validation Test\nIn 2018, we were told that our flight experiment would be the focus of Rodent Research - 12 (RR-12). Because our initial assessment of the tetanus toxoid was several years old, we ran a small verification test on a new lot of the toxoid to ensure that biological activity of the vaccine would be as expected during the launch. This dose response study focused around the dose optimized in previous tests. Endpoints include TT-specific IgG levels. This experiment was performed in March of 2019. While we were able to verify that the same dose of TT could be use with in RR-12, we found that the CpG adjuvant was not as effective as in previous experiments.  As a consequence, we were approved to double the CpG dose as part of the flight experiment.\n5.  An Analysis of the Effects of Spaceflight and Vaccination on Antibody Repertoire Diversity\nAs part of this project, our group had the opportunity to examine the antibody repertories in C57Bl/6 mice after a number of different situations. These data allowed us a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that antibody diversity can be altered by physiological adaptation. That is, spaceflight, simulated spaceflight and/or immune responses are disruptions in stable environment and affect antibody diversity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed antibody diversity, as expressed by CDR3 amino acids, in four experiments and five data sets we have generated, using analyses frequently used to assess communities in ecological contexts; specifically, the Shannon Index (SI), an established measure of diversity. We discovered a trend towards lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in SI between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the antibody repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.\n6.  A Comparison of Unamplified and Massively Multiplexed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification for Murine Antibody Repertoire Sequencing\nWe started this project with the hypothesis that an unamplified Immunoglobulin gene data set would provide comparable results to those seen in the commercially amplified data sets. However, there were no immunoglobulin repertoire studies done to compare data obtained using amplification techniques compared to the repertoire in a total RNASeq library. Concurrent with performing these analyses, we discovered that the required sample preparation for commercial sequencing also varied. Therefore, we found it necessary to examine the impact of sample preparation as part of our effort. This preflight verification work compared a data set generated using unamplified total RNA (TRNA) to commercially amplified data sets. We examined the role of commercial amplification and cDNA generation methods, as well as the impact of the starting material on sequence output.  We found that sequencing of unamplified splenic RNA provides a realistic snapshot of the total splenic B cell repertoire. We also demonstrated that a good understanding of the bioinformatics workflow and reporting of the methodology is critical and cannot be understated. We established that there are cellular biases and transcript stability differences within B cell subpopulations. However, for the purpose of assessing a whole tissue B cell repertoire, unamplified RNASeq was capable of providing a valuable glimpse of the most prevalent B cell clones. Most importantly, an unamplified data set may detect V-gene segments that amplified data sets miss.\nFlight Activities\nOur flight investigation was launched on NG-11 out of NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility (Wallops) on 4/17/19. At the request of NASA, this flight experiment combined experiments 1 and 2 of our original proposal, including: 1) a primary challenge in space, and 2) a primary challenge pre-flight + a secondary challenge in space. Members of our team participated in the baseline, environmental control, and vivarium control vaccinations and tissue collection at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). All of these events were on a 3-4 day delay after similar procedures were performed by the ISS astronauts. Collected tissues for ground controls were frozen and shipped to LLU and stored in our freezers at -80°C. A subset of the flight blood and spleen samples were returned from the ISS and shipped to LLU to our lab in August 2019. The remaining samples and frozen carcasses of our flight mice were returned and shipped to LLU in January 2020.\nWe performed a tetanus toxoid specific IgG/IgA/IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on the blood samples from this study. There were some issues with the samples brought back from the ISS. Specifically, there was significant lysing of the red blood cells (RBCs) and we were unable to separate the cells from the plasma in roughly half of the cells. However, despite these difficulties, we were able to detect Ig in the appropriate samples.\nThe data suggest that both the CpG adjuvant and a secondary inoculation with the vaccine increased the antibody responses as expected on the ground. The difference in scale for the primary vs. secondary response figures indicates that under normal circumstances, B cell memory developed and responded as expected. However, both the primary and secondary responses were drastically inhibited after flight. There are several possible reasons for this. Decreases in the efficacy of 1) the adjuvant, 2) antigen presentation, 3) B cell memory development after the primary injection, or 4) overall cell death in B cell counts are all possibilities. The approval of our last flight experiment (where both the primary and secondary inoculations occur in orbit) is crucial to help identify the actual mechanism.\nSummary of Work: 2020 - 2021\nCOVID-19 Related Delays\nLoma Linda University went on COVID-related lockdown in March 2020. At that time, all staff were strongly encouraged to work from home if possible. Much of the work associated with this grant involved tissue processing and data analysis. While the data analysis could continue (we were able to get permission for our postdoc to connect remotely to our server), the tissue processing was put on hold. This coincided with a shutdown at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for both COVID-related issues and a temporary university-wide power failure that halted processing for several weeks.\nDue to the uncertainty related to COVID, both of our postdocs (Drs. Trisha Rettig and John Tan) opted to move on to other positions. Dr. Rettig left for a position in industry on 10/5/2020. Dr. Tan moved on to a faculty position within LLU on 6/30/2020. Similarly, our research technician, Nina Nishiyama, moved on to go to graduate school at the University of North Carolina on July 17, 2020.\nSummary of Work 2021 - 2023\nPersonnel Changes\nIn 2021, we requested an augmentation to continue the work on this project due to a variety of COVID-related delays and personnel changes. As part of this request, we included salary for half of a technician, a postdoc and a grad student. The funding was approved and the revised cooperative agreement was signed in December of 2021. For well over a year, we were unable to identify a grad student and post-doc to continue working on this project. This was likely due to 1) the difficulties associated with COVID, 2) the national downturn in grad school applications, and 3) the timing for the additional funding (i.e., in the middle of Loma Linda University’s academic year). We were finally able to identify both a grad student and post-doc at the end of 2022.  However, shortly thereafter, our grad student had to take a prolonged leave of absence due to health-related issues.  He returned to work in the summer of 2023.\nChanges in Antibody Repertoire Analysis\nAfter several delays and mishaps beyond our control, we had to make a change in our analysis, switching our antibody repertoire analysis away from the facility at Kansas State University and going with the company iRepertoire. For the first 4-5 months of 2022, we dealt with supply chain related delays trying to get the samples checked and prepped to send. We were finally able to send these tissues out to begin processing in the summer of 2022.\nTissue Collection with BSP\nFor about three weeks in October of 2021, personnel from the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at NASA  Ames Research Center (Ames) traveled to Loma Linda University to help with the tissue collection from the RR-12/TARBIS mice (frozen in orbit at the time of the mission). This was originally supposed to happen back in 2019 but was delayed considerably for a variety of reasons, including COVID-related facility shutdowns. These tissues were either shipped to Ames and added to the BSP tissue archives or shipped to co-investigators for analysis.\nAdditional Opportunities in Collaboration with Dr. Xiao Wen “Vivian” Mao\nIn January-February of 2022, several members of the TARBIS team joined Dr. Xiao Wen Mao in support of her RR-18 Live Animal Return (LAR) tissue collection at the Roskamp Institute in Florida (NASA Grant #NNX15AB41G). Although Dr. Pecaut is a Co-investigator on Dr. Mao’s grant, he also collected additional tissues as part of the BSP (specifically, spleen). Because our RR-12/TARBIS tissues were collected and frozen in orbit, we were not able to perform any functional assays or flow cytometry-based phenotype analysis. Fortunately, Dr. Mao’s flight parameters were very similar to one of our RR-12 flight experiments (i.e., ~ 4 week flight time). Therefore, we used this opportunity to do phenotyping and cytokine expression to complement our antibody analysis from our previous flight. This also complements our ground-based centrifuge study (\"Spaceflight Impacts the Microbiome-Brain Axis\" or “SIMBA”, NASA Grant #: 80NSSC19K1038) which was also for 4 weeks. This analysis is ongoing.\nIn April-May of 2022, Dr. Mao’s second RR-18 dissection occurred. This study was designed to look at the recovery responses 2-3 months after landing. Although we do not have RR-12/TARBS data that would directly correspond with this recovery period, we felt knowing the phenotype distribution and cytokine responses would inform us of the long-term consequences of spaceflight on populations critical to the antibody response.\nCurrent Status\nThroughout the final months of this project, both our post-doc and graduate student have been working on analyzing the data generated by iRepertoire.  This analysis is ongoing even though the funds for this project have ceased.\nREFERENCES\nChapes SK, Mastro AM, Sonnenfeld G, Berry WD.

            "task_description": "This research proposal is aimed at better understanding the basic bone biological effects of various osteoporosis treatments as therapies for reducing or preventing bone loss due to space flight. The project will study hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, which is a technique that is well established as an effective and informative ground-based analog for studying the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system. In order to better understand the detailed effects of each, the treatments will be studied separately. The four treatments to be examined include two anabolic (bone building) therapies and two anti-resorptive therapies. One anabolic approach will use voluntary exercise and the other a new osteoporosis drug (anti-sclerostin antibody). Anti-resorptive drugs are the most popular for treating clinical osteoporosis and achieve their benefits by preventing bone resorption, which is part of the normal cycle of bone replenishment. Furthermore, the treatments will be used as pre-treatments and only administered prior to HU exposure. This is not realistic for astronauts, but it will allow more in-depth study of the fundamental nature of each treatment, and it will also align with the anticipated requirements of possible follow-up space flight experiments using the same rat animal model. The experiments to be conducted will characterize beneficial effects of pre-treatment upon bone loss due to HU as well as bone recovery following HU and return to weightbearing. Bone properties will be quantified using CT-based analyses, histological techniques for assessing bone cell function, as well as biomechanical testing to measure strength.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Completion of the studies outlined in this research proposal will provide new insights into the basic nature of the effects of exercise and pharmaceutical agents and how these interact with mechanical unloading and recovery therefrom.  Removal of weightbearing through hindlimb unloading is a severe and acute form of mechanical disuse that has been shown to simulate many of the effects of microgravity exposure due to space flight on the musculoskeletal system. Hindlimb unloading also induces many musculoskeletal system changes that are similar to accelerated aging as well as other disuse scenarios such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular impairment.  Thus, insights gained should also help advance basic understanding of the fundamental biology associated with Earth-bound clinical medicine as well as space flight effects.  Future space flight experiments can be designed to replicate the research to be conducted in this proposed project, and comparing results from the two will provide essential and more detailed understanding of the full efficacy, as well as limitations, of the adult rat HU model as a ground-based analog for human space flight.  Studying these treatments separately is not necessarily realistic for actual mission scenarios, but the results will nevertheless provide evidence-based rational data for contemplating and designing possible co-therapies using either combinations (simultaneously) or possible sequential scheduling protocols."

            "task_progress": "As explained in previous year progress reports, an adjustment was made during year 1 to reverse the order of the two animal experiments.  In the proposal, the first set of animal studies (Experiment 1) was to address Specific Aim 1, which compares two anabolic pre-treatments, but we decided to change this to address Specific Aim 2 first.  A major consideration driving this change was to allow more time to acquire the Sclerostin-Antibody drug.  Four experimental groups were needed for each of the two sets of animal experiments as further described below.\nAnti-Resorptive Pre-Treatment Animal Work: The two anti-resorptive pre-treatments are both bisphosphonate drugs, specifically risedronate and alendronate.  The overall protocol structure can be defined as follows:\nPre-treatment (PT) period = days 0 to 28\nHindlimb unloading (HU) period = days 28 to 56\nAmbulating recovery (AR) period = days 56 to 112\nThe four groups are defined as follows:\nControl (CON) = normal cage activity for PT, HU, and AR periods\nHU Control (HUC) = normal cage for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nRisedronate (RIS) = RIS for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nAlendronate (ALN) = ALN for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nThe animal experiments were conducted in three cohorts of animals due to constraints and considerations associated with animal housing space, animal cages, and personnel requirements.  Each cohort involved 45-50 animals, with the scheduling timetable as follows:\nCohort 1 – 27 May 2014 to 9 Oct 2014\nCohort 2 – 15 July 2014 to 25 Nov 2014\nCohort 3 – 30 Sept 2014 to 10 Feb 2015\nAll animal experiments included in vivo measures that were made on all animals every 28 days.  The main assessment conducted was pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans, which are made at the proximal tibia metaphysis (PTM) and tibia diaphysis (TD) of anesthetized animals.  In addition, blood was drawn at 28-day intervals for possible serum analysis of bone activity biomarkers.\nAnabolic Pre-Treatment Animal Work: The four groups identified for the anabolic pre-treatment studies are defined below along with a schematic depiction of the animal protocols.  The two anabolic pre-treatments are pharmaceutical administration and mechanical loading through exercise.  The specific pharmaceutical agent used was an anti-sclerostin anti-body compound provided by Lilly (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) through a Material Transfer Agreement.  The mechanical loading anabolic treatment consisted of a voluntary rat jumping protocol intended to simulate resistance exercise.\nThe overall protocol structure is again defined as follows:\nPre-treatment (PT) period = days 0 to 28\nHindlimb unloading (HU) period = days 28 to 56\nAmbulating recovery (AR) period = days 56 to 112\nThe four groups are defined as follows:\nControl (CON) = normal cage activity for PT, HU, and AR periods\nHU Control (HUC) = normal cage for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nSclerostin Anti-body (SCL) = SCL for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nExercise (REX) = REX for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR\nThe same in vivo measures were made on all animals every 28 days; specifically, pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans were made at the PTM and TD of anesthetized animals, and blood was drawn at 28-day intervals for possible serum analysis of bone activity biomarkers.\nMajor milestones for the anabolic pre-treatment portions of the project are summarized as follows:\nJuly – December 2015: •\tMaterial Transfer Agreement (MTA) completed July 2015 ; •\tReceipt of initial shipment of Scl-Ab October 2015\nNovember – December 2015: •\tPilot study for Scl-Ab dosing ; •\tPilot study for voluntary jumping exercise\nJanuary – September 2016:\n•\tAnimal work for Scl-Ab drug pre-treatment conducted in 3 cohorts:\nCohort 1 – 26 Jan 2016 to 22 June 2016 (20 Scl-Ab; 5 REX)\nCohort 2 – 18 Apr 2016 to 31 Aug 2016 (13 Scl-Ab)\nCohort 3 – 5 May 2016 to 14 Sept 2016 (12 Scl-Ab)\nSeptember – December 2016: •\tContinued refinement of voluntary jumping exercise details and new cages\nJanuary 2017 – April 2018: •\tAnimal work for voluntary jumping exercise (REX) conducted in 4 cohorts  \t\tCohort 1 – 10 Jan 2017 to 16 May 2017 (10 REX)\nCohort 2 – 13 June 2017 to 14 Nov 2017 (10 REX)\nCohort 3 – 13 Sept 2017 to 10 Feb 2018 (10 REX)\nCohort 4 – 12 Dec 2017 to 8 Apr 2018 (10 REX)\nAs reflected above, a decision was made to stagger the two parts of the anabolic pre-treatment arm of the project.  The Scl-Ab (pharmacologic) pre-treatment part was done first and was completed in September 2016.  The voluntary jumping exercise (REX) pre-treatment part was resumed in January 2017 and continued into to 2018.  Two factors prompted the strategy to stagger the Scl-Ab and REX parts of the study.  First, the duration of the window of availability for the sclerostin anti-body compound was uncertain, so it was deemed best to acquire all of the material that was promised as soon as possible and reasonable.  The second factor was that the voluntary jumping exercise required additional refinements and adjustments in order to make it practical and effective for the remaining 40 animals scheduled to conduct the jumping exercises.  Five animals were included in the first cohort of the Scl-Ab pre-treatment part, and the knowledge gained from that was used to adjust and improve the process.  Most prominently, the customized cages required for acclimating, training, and exercising the animals needed to be redesigned and new ones constructed.  Consequently, the first of the four remaining REX cohorts was not started until January 2017.  In addition, the labor-intensive nature of the jumping exercise training protocol dictates a maximum of 10 animals per cohort, as reflected in the summary above.\nAn overall summary of the major in vivo and ex vivo measurements is as follows.\nIn Vivo Longitudinal Measures\nDensitometry by pQCT (left tibia; proximal metaphysis and midshaft) ; ~ vBMD, BMC, cross-sectional area, cross-sectional moment of inertia, etc.\nEx Vivo Endpoint Measures\nDensitometry by pQCT (tibia; proximal metaphysis and midshaft): ~ vBMD, BMC, cross-sectional area, cross-sectional moment of inertia, etc.\nDensitometry and microstructure by microCT (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN) ; ~ trabecular microarchitecture, vBMD, BMC, TMD, etc.\nStatic and dynamic histomorphometry (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN): ~ trabecular, cortical, MS/BS, MAR, BFR, etc.\nBone Strength (tibia metaphysis RPC, tibia & femur midshaft, FN): ~ ultimate load, stiffness, ultimate strength, elastic modulus, toughness, etc.\nMuscle Weights (hindlimb posterior crural muscles): ~ wet weights for gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris\nAll in vivo pQCT measurements have been made and data analyzed.\nAlmost all of the ex vivo measurements have been completed as well.\nResults have been disseminated to date primarily through conference abstracts, posters, and presentations, as indicated in the Bibliography section.  One journal article has been published.\nTwo PhD students are finishing their dissertations in fall 2019 (Jessica Brezicha) and spring 2020 (Scott Lenfest).  These dissertation research projects focus on the two anabolic pre-treatments, sclerostin anti-body and voluntary jumping exercise, respectively.  Because of the sequential and inter-dependent nature of the animal experiments, outcome measures gathered, and subsequent data analyses, dissemination through journal articles has been delayed.  Publications should be readily forthcoming from the completed dissertation work of these two PhD students.  Publication of the earlier results for the two bisphosphonate drug pre-treatments is also being coordinated with publication of the anabolic pre-treatment results to permit detailed comparisons and more in-depth consideration.",

However, studies of edible produce during spaceflight have been limited, leaving a significant knowledge gap in the methods required to grow safe, acceptable, nutritious crops for consumption in microgravity. The “Veggie” vegetable-production system on the International Space Station (ISS) offers an opportunity to develop a “pick-and-eat” fresh vegetable component to the ISS food system as a first step to bioregenerative supplemental food production. We propose growing salad plants in the Veggie unit during spaceflight, focusing on the impact of light quality and fertilizer formulation on crop morphology, edible biomass yield, microbial food safety, organoleptic acceptability, nutritional value, and behavioral health benefits of the fresh produce. Phase A of the project would involve flight tests using leafy greens. Phase B would focus on dwarf tomato. Our work will help define light colors, levels, and horticultural best practices to achieve high yields of safe, nutritious leafy greens and tomatoes to supplement a space diet of prepackaged food. Our final deliverable will be the development of growth protocols for these crops in a spaceflight vegetable production system.\nSpecific aim 1: Evaluate the effects of four light treatments and two different fertilizer compositions on the yield, morphology, organoleptic acceptability, and nutritional attributes of leafy greens during flight-definition and flight testing.\nSpecific aim 2: Perform cultivar selection and evaluate the effects of four different red: blue light treatments and two different fertilizer compositions on the yield, morphology, organoleptic acceptability, and nutritional attributes of dwarf tomato during ground and flight tests.\nSpecific aim 3: Perform hazard analysis, develop plans for minimizing microbial hazards, and screen flight-grown produce for potential pathogens.",

            "task_progress": "Status  Pick-and-eat Salad-crop Productivity, Nutritional Value, and Acceptability to Supplement the International Space Station (ISS) Food System (VEG-04A, VEG-04B, and VEG-05) is a set of hybrid experiments of plant research with human organoleptic and behavioral research. These experiments are sponsored by the Human Research Program but are implemented in partnership with the Space Biology Program.  The VEG-04 flight experiments were conducted in 2019, and the VEG-05 experiment was conducted on ISS Dec. 2022 through March 2023. Because of the delay, an additional component was added to this experiment, known as HRF VEG (which stands for Human Research Facility – Veggie). The HRF VEG experiment consists of collecting data-of-opportunity from other space biology investigations with plants that were conducted on the ISS between the VEG-04 and VEG-05 tests. Data collected are specific to the human research foci of this project and include only behavioral health and performance data with the Veggie Questionnaire and Profile of Mood States data collected and Organoleptic acceptability data on the crops.     I.\tUpdates   A.\tStudent Augmentation of Grant  A student augmentation grant titled “Pick-and-Eat Salad-Crop Nutrition & Next-Generation System Designs” was awarded by the Human Research Program to PhD student Jess Bunchek associated with this larger project. This augmentation enabled nutritional analysis of crop samples grown in the EDEN ISS plant production facility at the German Neumayer Station III in Antarctica and the aeroponic nutrient solutions with which the crops were grown. These data will provide a better understanding of crop nutrient composition across different plant production platforms and across a long-duration expedition in an isolated, confined, extreme environment that has similarities to a space mission. With this augmentation, Jess was able to attend the HRP Investigators Workshop and present “Nutrition of Antarctic-Grown Crops to Supplement the Crew Diet, with Applications for Spaceflight.” A manuscript highlighting this experimentation is expected in FY24.\nB.\tVEG-04A and B  VEG-04A was conducted during Increment 57-58 and ran from June 4, 2019-July 9, 2019.  VEG-04B was conducted during Increment 61-62 and ran from October 1, 2019-November 28, 2019, and both had ground controls run ~48 hours later.  Science samples were returned from the ISS and were processed for microbiological food safety and chemical analyses.\nAn article, Pick-and-eat space crop production flight testing on the International Space Station, was published in Feb. 2024 in a special edition of The Journal of Plant Interactions, Article Collection on “Plant Astrobiology.” The citation is:\nJess M.

In the Veggie unit, during spaceflight, salad plants will be grown, focusing on the impact of light quality and fertilizer formulation on crop morphology, edible biomass yield, microbial food safety, organoleptic acceptability, nutritional content, and behavioral health benefits of the fresh produce for the Solanum lycopersicum \"Red Robin\" dwarf Tomato cultivar. The VEG-05 experiment will test different red-to-blue light ratios using the Veggie units on the ISS. Tomato plants will be grown in Veggie for ~100 days and astronaut crewmembers will provide plant care and pollination, and harvest fruit 3 times during and at the end of this growth period. Crewmembers will be asked to complete self-report surveys, including the Profile of Mood States – Short Form (POMS-SF) and a Veggie-specific questionnaire pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. They will also be asked to perform an organoleptic evaluation of a portion of the fresh produce they consume at harvest.\nConsumed tomato samples will have their mass measured on ISS prior to crew consumption, and half of the produce will be frozen and returned to Earth for post-flight microbiological food safety and nutritional analysis. The goal of this experiment is to help define light colors and horticultural best practices to achieve high yields of safe, nutritious appealing tomato fruit to supplement a space diet of prepackaged food.\nVEG-05 Flight Operations  SpX-CRS-26 launched the VEG-05 payload on Nov. 26, 2022, and it docked on Nov. 27. Initiation of VEG-05 was started on 12/9/2022, but challenges led to subsequent initiation activities on 12/12/2022 and plant growth initiation on 12/14/2022, with the first ground control started 12/16/2022. This was later terminated due to poor germination and a second ground control was run 2/1/2023-05/12/2023. Both flight and ground control ran 100 days, with harvests of fruit at day 83, day 90, and day 100. In total, from the five surviving red-rich lighted plants in flight, only 5 ripe fruits were produced, and from the four surviving blue-rich lighted flight plants, 10 fruits were produced with only 6 of these ripe by day 100. A large number of photos and some video tours are part of the plant data collected. Due to the challenges with growth enumerated in the previous report, all planned activities were not accomplished. Human subject surveys were conducted but there were insufficient fruit samples for sensory evaluation. All fruit and plant samples were returned frozen at or below -80ºC. Plant samples included leaves and adventitious roots of surviving plants. Water samples were returned from root mat reservoirs, with the post-growth samples collected the day after harvest. Only a few swabs were taken from the flight Veggies from bungees only, due to harvest activities running over time. The planned samples from bellows and the Veggie fans were not collected. Pillows 1, 3, 7, and 10 were also collected and returned for analysis of roots, wicks, and substrates.\nBecause of the small sample sizes and factors affecting growth on the ISS, the objectives of assessing the light quality effect (red: blue light treatments) will not be fully achieved. Revised objectives of this study include comparing stressed flight plants with normal ground plants to determine the impact of plant overwatering stress in space on food safety and the plant microbial community, to determine nutrient content changes in fruit and leaves from stressed plants, and to evaluate stress metabolism changes in returned tissue by transcriptomic analysis. Postflight analysis was conducted with the following analyses being prioritized: A. culturable microbiology and food safety as well as molecular microbial community analysis of 1. ripe fruit; 2. leaves, stems, and adventitious roots; 3. pillow components (roots, wicks, and substrates); 4. swabs; and 5. water samples from root mats before and after growth. B. transcriptomics of leaf tissue and adventitious roots, and C. elemental analysis of leaf tissue.  Unfortunately, there was insufficient tissue to conduct the analyses of leaves; however, elemental analyses were performed on a few of the harvested fruit.\nMicrobial Analyses  Total Culturable Microorganisms were assessed with determinations of Aerobic Plate Counts (APC)/Bacteria and Total Yeast and Mold Count.  Specific pathogens were screened for including Generic E. coli/Coliforms using Petrifilm, Salmonella sp. using enrichment/selective media, and Staphylococcus aureus using Petrifilm. Any colonies that grew in these methods were isolated and identified using the Biolog MicroID system and MicroSEQ fungal and bacterial gene sequencing ID. Screening for selected pathogens yielded negative results and this was confirmed by community 16S and ITS sequencing.\nWe observed no difference between red-rich and blue-rich treatments in bacterial and fungal CFUs in-flight samples. The red-rich ground control surface swabs and adventitious roots had significantly lower bacterial counts than the blue-rich treatment, while the fungal counts were lower in the red-rich wicks, leaves, and adventitious roots. Blue-rich fruit samples, surface swabs and leaves were lower in the ground controls than in the flight samples for both bacteria and fungi.\nMolecular Analyses - Microbiome  Community sequencing was performed using the 16S rRNA gene for bacterial taxonomic identification with the QIIME 2.0 with Silva approach. ITS was used for fungal taxonomic identification using KRAKEN2 with the UNITE database.\nIf we look at a heat map of the total microbiome, we see differences between flight and ground, and we see that true roots (from plant pillows) and adventitious roots had higher community diversity than leaf or fruit samples. When we look at 16S details by sample we see Pseudomonas dominating many of the samples, and if we remove that we start to see different clustering appear.\nMolecular Analyses - Transcriptome  Transcriptomics of leaf and adventitious roots sampled was performed with the GeneLab RNA-Seq Consensus Pipeline-RCP. We looked at the percentage distribution of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in adventitious roots and leaves of ground and flight plants grown with either the red-rich or blue-rich lighting treatments and saw that leaf and root tissue in blue-rich lighting showed a higher percent of DEGs.\nWhen Principal Component Analyses (PCA) are performed on these data, we start to see leaf and root DEGs clustered based upon condition (flight versus ground) and gene expression completely separated based on tissue type, but there is overlap in both tissue types between flight and ground. If PCA plots are coded to differentially represent red-rich and blue-rich treatments, there is considerable overlap between ground and flight samples in red-rich treatments, but blue-rich samples segregate between these locations.\nWork is underway to interpret the differential gene expression observed in VEG-05. In leaves, there is strong differential regulation of genes in blue-rich grown samples in flight. Biological processes are identified, such as light-harvesting photosystem I, cell division, and protein regulation. There is a different group of upregulated genes in blue-rich grown ground control leaf samples with functions such as cell cycle regulation and protein biosynthesis being modified. In adventitious roots, we see some similar responses as in the leaf tissue including changes in photosynthesis, ATP energy production, and protein biosynthesis. This is not unexpected because the adventitious roots did contain some chlorophyll.\nIn the red-rich grown plant samples, there were fewer DEGs. For leaves, these involve respiration, mitochondria and energy production in the form of electron transport. In adventitious roots, DEGs are showing that these are responding to red-light differential regulation in photosynthesis and energy production, protein biosynthesis. When gene ontology is looked at, we start to see a broad categorization of the genes involved. For adventitious roots under the same conditions, we see similar responses to the leaves but also responses to stress, hydrogen peroxides catabolic processes or redox stress.\nOverall, there appear to be more DEGs in leaf and adventitious root samples in blue-rich light compared to red-rich light. A functional enrichment analysis of DEGs showed similarities between leaf and adventitious root samples, as expected. Some of the hallmarks of spaceflight were detected in flight samples including stress response, lignin, radiation stress, and hydrogen peroxide catabolic processes. Further analyses are underway, and two manuscripts on the VEG-05 plant data are being prepared. While not generating the desired information on spaceflight growth responses of healthy crops, our team is hopeful that these analyses will shed light on tomato responses to stress in this environment as plant overwatering stress is a mission-relevant condition that could occur in future space crop growth systems.\nBehavioral Health data from VEG-04, HRF VEG, and VEG-05  Plants as a Potential Spaceflight Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) Countermeasure  Plants are a potential countermeasure for the stresses of living in space. Caring for plants and eating fresh food have been shown to serve as a psychological benefit for previous astronauts and for others in analogous environments such as Antarctica (Schlacht et al., 2019, Vessel & Russo, 2015). Gardening can be therapeutic and has been used as such in terrestrial settings (Odeh & Guy, 2017). These effects may carry over or even be more pronounced in austere resource-limited environments such as spaceflight. It can reduce stress and increase sensory stimulation and enjoyment (Vessel & Russo, 2015). Growing crops for consumption may also offer astronauts a form of meaningful and engaging work as they care for living things in an austere environment away from Earth’s nature and as they provide sustenance for their crew. Additionally, fresh produce may enhance the diet and encourage consistent consumption by avoiding menu fatigue, which may further support psychological health and well-being by supporting a healthy brain and body (Douglas et al., 2022). Despite these potential benefits, difficulty in crop production and struggling or dying plants may reduce positive effects. The data on the psychological effects of growing crops in spaceflight is limited.\nAs such, we examined behavioral outcomes associated with tending to plants and consuming crops grown during long-duration missions. Here, we further characterized which aspects of horticulture are most salient and psychologically beneficial to astronaut health and well-being. We hypothesized that engaging with plants during a mission would have a beneficial effect as evidenced by reported positive mood and enhanced well-being, meaningfulness, connection to Earth, relationships, and performance. We also hypothesized that interacting with the plants would be a source of positive sensory stimulation for the crew. Preliminary in-flight data analysis results are described below. More comprehensive analyses are underway in preparation for the final report.\nMethods for the In-flight Phase for BHP Aims  Participants  Participants were 27 astronauts who interacted with the plant systems VEG-04, VEG-05, and HRF-VEG (Human Research Facility – Veggie). HRF-VEG data were collected from other space biology investigations of plants that were being conducted on the ISS between the VEG-04 and VEG-05 tests. HRF-VEG data included VEG-03 I, J, K, and L and PH-04. Total N sizes noted below vary by different plant activities, depending on what each astronaut may or may not have experienced during their mission. There was a total of 106 in-flight observations.     Measures  POMS-SF. The Profile of Mood States Short Form (Curran et al., 1995) was given to participants every three weeks around plant growth. Results forthcoming.  BHP Veggie Questionnaire. The Behavioral Health and Performance Veggie Questionnaire was given to participants monthly, beginning with plant growth initiation. Plant and crop growth experience items examined enjoyment and time spent performing specific activities with the plants; behavioral health outcomes such as engagement, demanding, meaningful, and effects on well-being, mood, performance, and relationships with others; connections to the Earth; desire to work with and eat plants; sensory stimulation for sight, smell, touch, and taste; human factor aspects of time, training, and supplies; and experiences with struggling or dying plants. Items were initially offered on a 201 or 101-point visual analog scale (VAS), with higher ends of the scale indicating more positive outcomes, e.g., enhanced enjoyment, meaning, and engagement. The lower ends of the scale were anchored with more negative outcomes, e.g., diminished enjoyment, etc. The scale midpoints were neutral in that they neither enhanced nor diminished. Data was binned to a 7-point Likert scale at the direction of the study’s biostatistician for use in our analyses. Participants selected a specific survey version based on whether they interacted with the plant system(s) or not, and we included only the scores from the crewmembers who participated in any given activity.\nPreliminary Results and Discussion for BHP Aims  Generally, engaging in tasks related to the plants and crop growth (a.k.a., Veggie tasks), was enjoyable. The highest ratings were related to consuming the harvested plants and voluntary viewing, suggesting that some crewmembers found time to experience the plants and nature as a source of enjoyment. Tending to the plants was also moderately enjoyable (e.g., plant thinning, pollinating, wick opening, and harvesting), indicating that there are BHP benefits from this work task.\nThe BHP impacts of whether the task was engaging, meaningful, supported well-being, or was demanding for a crewmember also indicates generally positive trends. Engaging, meaningful, and supporting well-being were strongly, and positively correlated with each other, which is consistent with behavioral health and workplace research that suggests that engaging and meaningful work can support well-being. Scores for these three positively-oriented variables increase over time, suggesting that the benefits of working with plants – that is, seeing them grow, tending to them, continuing to enjoy them as nature, and ultimately, consuming the fresh produce – becomes a greater source of behavioral health benefits as the long-duration mission continues.\nFor plant activities, not only are they generally enjoyable for those crewmembers engaging with the plants, but the data show voluntary viewing, watering, harvesting, and consuming as consistently, positively related to the task being engaging and meaningful, and enhancing well-being. Preliminary analyses suggest that working with plants in space as well as consuming them, can be a behavioral health countermeasure for long-duration spaceflight. Additional analyses will be completed for the final report and a publication is in the works.\nReferences  Curran, S. L., Andrykowski, M. A., & Studts, J. L. (1995).

            "task_description": "NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow\nTissue degeneration and the failure of normal stem cell-based tissue regeneration in microgravity pose significant risks for astronaut health during long-duration spaceflight missions. The immediate degenerative effects we understand best are those studied during short-term Low-Earth orbit spaceflight experiments and include rapid microgravity adaptive bone and muscle loss, loss of cardiovascular capacity, defects in wound and bone fracture healing, and impaired immune function. Although bone loss in space has been studied in both humans and rodent models, such as mice, the precise mechanisms by which bone loss occurs are still currently debated. Rapid bone loss has been well documented within the first couple of days of spaceflight and has been attributed to increased osteoclast resorption of trabecular bone; however, this effect seems to be a rapid and short term response to unloading. Perhaps of more relevance to long duration spaceflight missions is the possible slowing or alteration in bone growth that occurs in microgravity, characterized by a decrease in the osteoblast population of both cortical and trabecular bone. Furthermore, osteoblasts have been shown to exhibit altered cell growth and proliferation, further indicating a role for loss of bone growth in addition to osteoclast-mediated bone degradation in spaceflight-induced osteopenia.\nDuring our previous short-duration (15 days) spaceflight studies with mice, we have addressed the problem of regenerative deficits in microgravity, with a specific focus on bone tissue and bone marrow stem cells. We have found that microgravity impairs the ability of mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes. Furthermore, we have investigated the impact of altered somatic stem cell regenerative capacity on bone tissue, and found significant degeneration of bone tissue due to both increased bone resorption and decreased regenerative bone formation. Through these studies, we also identified a significant molecular mechanism, activation of the cell cycle arrest molecule CDKN1a/p21, in proliferating osteoprogenitors on the bone surface and proliferating chondrocytes that may account for the observed alterations in tissue regeneration in space. Global gene expression studies of bone and bone marrow isolated from space-flown mice also showed significant alterations in proliferation and differentiation pathways. Altered gene expression included several genes highly relevant to regenerative health including cold inducible RMNA binding protein, DNA damage inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), and interleukins IL1ß and IL1F9. Furthermore, we found down-regulation of a master controller for oxidative stress mitigation in both bone tissue and bone marrow, NFE2L2 (Nrf2), suggesting increased levels and susceptibility to reactive oxygen species. Taken together, this data indicated that CDKN1a/p21 could be an important mechanism for the regulation of tissue regeneration in response to alterations in mechanical load.\nAs CDKN1a/p21 can be induced by oxidative stress, and as mechanical unloading is also thought to induce oxidative stress, we hypothesize that oxidative stress induced by mechanical unloading could induce p21 over-expression during spaceflight resulting in the observed inhibition of regenerative bone formation in space. Therefore, the aims of this proposal are to firstly build upon our previous spaceflight results by using the CDKN1a/p21 knockout (KO) mouse to investigate the role of CDKN1a/p21 in regenerative arrest induced by ground-based models of microgravity (hindlimb unloading) and secondly, to elucidate the molecular mechanism connecting mechanical unloading to oxidative stress and CDKN1a/p21 induction.",

            "task_progress": "To achieve the above, we firstly aimed to conduct a hindlimb unloading experiment with KO (knock out) mice and test the hypothesis the CDKN1a/p21 pathway is part of the molecular mechanism for microgravity inhibition of mesenchymal stem cell-mediated bone tissue regeneration in-vivo. We also aimed to conduct a uniaxial mechanical load test with CDKN1a/p21 KO stromal mesenchymal stem cell cultures to test the hypothesis that mechano-stimulation may directly down-regulate CDKN1a/p21 levels in stem cells undergoing regenerative differentiation through either transcriptional or translational mechanisms. Finally, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the CDKN1a/p21 pathway in osteoprogenitors is regulated by oxidative stress in-vivo.\nDuring my NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) appointment, we made significant progress on all aims of the above research plan. Additionally, we wrote and were awarded a NASA spaceflight grant to investigate the influence of microgravity on osteoprogenitor differentiation into mineralized nodules on the International Space Station (ISS) using the Bioculture System hardware, enabling us to specifically compare and contrast ground-based differentiation under conditions of increased mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, we have published 4 articles in peer-reviewed journals (3 research articles and 1 review article) based on our previous spaceflight experiments showing inhibition of stem cell regenerative capacity in space and activation of CDKN1a/p21 as a potential molecular mechanism causing this inhibition. These papers pave the way and lay foundations for the research articles that will be published based on the specific role of CDKN1a/p21 on regenerative bone formation.\nOverall, these studies have significantly contributed to our knowledge of how mechanical unloading regulates stem cell-based tissue regeneration and the role that CDKN1a/p21 plays in this process. The spaceflight grants that were awarded during this NPP fellowship will enable us to further elucidate the specific role of CDKN1a/p21 on mesenchymal stem cell proliferation, differentiation and regeneration capacities during microgravity exposure on the ISS.",

            "task_description": "This project seeks to use an unbiased genome-wide approach to define the changes in DNA methylation that occur in Arabidopsis during spaceflight, in order to better understand the spectrum of responses that allow adaptation to the spaceflight environment. This project is one of both discovery on a genome-wide scale and application to specific hypotheses. We propose replicated whole genome bisulfite sequencing in Arabidopsis roots and leaves to discover and quantify 5-methylCytosine (5mCyt) epigenetic modification, coupled with RNASeq examination of the comparable transcriptomes to both quantitatively and qualitatively assess spaceflight-associated DNA methylation on transcript profiles. We will then test the hypothesis that methylation is involved in spaceflight adaptation by similarly examining methylation mutants.\nEpigenetic features play a role in the regulation of gene expression and the subsequent response of an organism to its environment. DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification that is not directly coded into the genome sequence and yet can modify expression and be inherited for at least for one generation. Several groups, including ours, have shown that large numbers of plant genes are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight.\nWe now have extensive preliminary data that show significant genome-wide 5mCyt modification differences in spaceflight plants compared to ground controls.\nThe tactical objectives of this proposal are: 1) Bisulfite whole genome sequencing will be used to generate maps of spaceflight-induced changes in 5mCyt at single base-pair resolution for roots and leaves. 2) RNASeq will be used to digitally quantify and qualitatively assess transcriptome in the same samples, as differential methylation has been functionally linked to changes in both promoter regulation and structural changes in RNAs. These data will characterize functional impacts of spaceflight induced across the entire genome. 3) DNA methylation mutants will be used to directly test the hypothesis that epigenetic modification of DNA is a key aspect of spaceflight adaptation.\nElucidating the spaceflight methylomes of plants contributes to the fundamental understanding of how biology responds and adapts to the spaceflight environment, and also provides insight in the adaptive strategies plants use in the face of novel stimuli outside of their evolutionary experience. The long term goal of this line of inquiry is to understand how the methylome contributes to the adaptive strategies of plants to novel environments.",

            "task_progress": "In this final year of the grant, the returned plant samples were extracted and evaluated, and then ensuing molecular data analyzed. So far, these data have contributed to two  additional manuscripts; one in press, and one in the final stages of preparation. A synopsis of the results and conclusions follow:\nHarvests\nPlants for SVT (Science Verification Test) and EVT (Experiment Verification Test) were grown in VEGGIE and were harvested at 11 days.  Each plate was harvested to a single Falcon tube containing RNA later.  Samples were then stowed at -80Deg Celsius until returned to the Principal Investigators (PIs).  Harvest from station was monitored by the PI via video communication from their lab in Gainesville, FL.\nPost-Harvest Analysis\nSamples for both flight and ground control were transferred by the PI to the University of Florida for analysis of quality and quantity.   Samples were warmed and separated into root and leaf tissue, hypocotyl tissue was removed and stored for future analysis.  Plates were then separated into 4 replicates, each having two plates within a replicate.  A portion of the plants (2-4) were removed from each plate for RNA extraction, and then depending on genotype, 4-20 plants that were left on the plate were used for DNA extraction.\nExtraction of Nucleic Acids from Flight and Ground Control Samples\nRNA extraction was completed using a Qiagen RNeasy Plant kit.  DNA extraction was preformed using a method developed in-house for high levels of clean genomic DNA.  All sample material provided enough nucleic acid material for downstream applications.\nImaging and plant growth: Images of the first plates in VEGGIE were taken on Day 4, Day 8, and Day 11 (harvest).  Due to excellent germination and growth all plates appear to have consistent growth. Photography of plates was sufficient for post-harvest analysis to provide data fro growth rates and morphometric analyses.\nMethylome Analyses: To examine the role of 5mCyt in spaceflight adaptation, the APEX04-EPEX experiment conducted onboard the ISS evaluated the spaceflight altered genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants (methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)) along with a wild type Col-0 control. The methylome data revealed that both elp2-5 and met1-7 mutants had, on average, significantly higher methylation levels in flight than in the ground controls for both leaf and root tissues, whereas there were no differences in methylation levels between flight samples and ground controls in Col-0 roots and leaves. Overlapping the differential gene expression data with differentially methylated cytosines within protein-coding gene regions revealed the complex transcriptional regulatory processes of adapting to spaceflight. The methylation mutants provided new insights into organ-specific adaptation to spaceflight. The results show that elp2-5 has a role in regulating root adaptation to spaceflight, whereas met1-7 has a more prominent role in the physiological adaptation of leaves. Gene ontology enrichment showed that a significant proportion of Col-0 differentially-methylated and expressed genes were associated with pathogen response consistent with previous reports. Met1-7 and elp2-5 showed enrichments unique to each organ and genotype. The major points of discovery were:\n- Spaceflight increases genome-wide DNA methylation levels in met1-7 and elp2-5 but not in the wild type Col-0 plants\nAverage genome wide methylation level profiles in spaceflight and on the ground.\n- Spaceflight changes in DNA methylation levels were associated with protein-coding gene regions.\n- Spaceflight alters the distribution and direction of differential methylated cytosines (DmCs)  and differential methylated regions (DMRs) in elp2-5 and met1-7 leaves and roots.\n- There is a positive correlation of differential DNA methylation and differential gene expression.     - The patterns of differential DNA methylation and differential gene expression in response to spaceflight differs among the methylation mutants and the wild type.\nGeneral conclusions\nA growing number of studies are showing evidence that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating stress responses and adaptation in plants. Understanding how plant systems adapt to novel environments, such as spaceflight, is important for advancing research in plant abiotic stress tolerance, which has valuable implications for ensuring food security in adverse environments. Previous spaceflight transcriptomic and proteomic data showed prominent spaceflight changes in genes typically associated with abiotic stress response on Earth. Therefore, to understand how plants adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight, it is important to investigate the epigenetic regulation of plants’ genes in spaceflight and identify specific marks that contribute to known gene expression patterns.\nIn this study, DNA methylation dynamics in the leaves and roots of wild-type Col-0 and two methylation mutant (elp2 and met1) Arabidopsis lines grown in spaceflight and on the ground were assessed with a single-base resolution. The genome-wide analyses presented here show that the mechanisms that regulate spaceflight responses also involve changes in DNA methylation status in an organ-specific manner. Although spaceflight did not induce large scale genome-wide changes in wild type Col-0 leaves and roots, spaceflight did induce significant genome-wide methylation changes in the roots and leaves of both elp2-5 and met1-7.\nSeveral observations reported here suggest that differential DNA methylation in response to spaceflight is highly organ-specific and affects a different set of genes, and the GO-enriched categories differed between leaves and roots in both the methylation mutants. Thus, the finding that global methylation patterns are drastically remodeled by spaceflight in an organ-specific manner could provide insight into how epigenetic marks influence plant genomes and transcriptional programs to respond and adapt to novel conditions.",

Because root growth and its architecture have recently been recognized as key contributors to plant productivity and adaptation to environmental stress, our research is also likely to have long-term impact in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. Furthermore, many of the behaviors under investigation involve auxin-related processes. This plant hormone is a key contributor to most aspects of plant growth, development, and response to the environment. Therefore, this project is likely to yield important new insights into some of the key mechanisms that control plant growth, development, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses."

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORTING NOVEMBER 2019:  Most of the studies of plant growth and adaptation to the microgravity environment have been carried out using Arabidopsis thaliana, a model dicot plant. However, most of the cultivated crops on Earth are monocots. Therefore, the purpose of our project was to investigate the impact of the microgravity environment present on the International Space Station (ISS) on the germination, growth, and morphology of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings, and evaluate their molecular adaptation to this environment using RNAseq analyses of transcription profiles. To do this, we first developed a new foam-based plant growth unit (named the APEX Growth Chamber), in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the Kennedy Space Center Flight Support Team. This chamber allows planting Brachypodium seeds within a block of foam on the ground, before flight. The seeds remain dry during take off and travel to the ISS. Upon arrival, an astronaut (Dr. Scott Tingle in our experiment) injects a nutritive solution into the foam, triggering seed germination and growth with the VEGGIE growth unit. Using this approach, we were able to grow 3 accessions of Brachypodium distachyon (Bd21, BD21-3, and Gaz-8) on ISS with four biological repeats per accession (four APEX Growth Chambers containing 24 seeds each). We also carried out two ground controls. One of these ground controls included germinating and growing the same accessions on the ground under conditions that mimicked those encountered on ISS, with a 48-h delay (ground control 1). A second ground control involved growing Bd21 seedlings under the same conditions for three days, followed by 5-min gravistimulation (GS) or 5-min mechanostimulation (MS) (ground control 2). At the end of each experiment, the seedlings were photographed, and the plant material was harvested and fixed in RNALater in KFT fixation units for subsequent analyses. Images were used to quantify root and shoot growth under both conditions, whereas plant materials were dissected to separate shoots and roots for subsequent expression profiling. RNA was extracted for RNASeq analysis. Our results show that the plants grown under microgravity displayed shorter, very hairy roots. Shoots were shorter in only one of the accessions tested (Bd21).\nExpression profiling revealed a large number of Bd21 genes whose expression either increased or decreased in shoots and/or roots under microgravity. Most of the differentially expressed genes were organ-specific, and did not respond to either GS or MS under ground-control conditions. The lists of microgravity-response genes were enriched for genes predicted to function in plant responses to environmental and oxidative stress as well as reactive oxygen species. They were also enriched for genes involved in radiation response, implying that Brachypodium might serve as a good model to investigate the effects of cosmic radiation on plants. Few of the microgravity-response genes were also differentially expressed in response to GS or MS on the ground. Those that did respond to both GS and microgravity constitute excellent candidates for a function in gravity signal transduction. Overall, our studies identify several genes and pathways that could be further engineered to improve monocot plant adaptation to the microgravity environment, facilitating their use in bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space-exploration missions.\nGround based studies were also carried out to investigate the natural variation that exists between Brachypodium accessions for root-growth and behavioral responses to GS. These studies led to the discovery of several key loci that may contribute to the regulation of proprioception in plants.\nExperimental Results and Conclusions\nDevelopment of a plant growth chamber to test Brachypodium distachyon seedlings growth under microgravity conditions\nTo test the ability of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings to germinate, grow, and adapt to the microgravity environment of the ISS, we developed a novel plant growth unit (named APEX Growth Chamber) in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the NASA Kennedy Space Center Flight Support team. This system is based on an Oasis foam-based growth system previously used by Dr. Levine to grow plants in space. With this setup, Brachypodium seeds are inserted pre-flight into a dry block of foam that is surrounded by gauze and a nylon mesh, and is mounted on a medium injection device within a Magenta-box assembly. The seeds are kept in a dormant dry state, unable to germinate during spaceflight to the ISS. When the experiment is ready for activation on ISS, an astronaut can easily inject liquid growth medium into the foam support through the injection device, thereby imbibing the seeds and triggering their germination under red light.\nThis novel plant germination and growth system had to be developed because early preparatory experiments had demonstrated that the far-red light pretreatment typically used to prevent the germination of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings on agar-based media during takeoff and travel to the ISS, has an opposite effect on agar-medium-embedded Brachypodium seeds, triggering their germination. An alternative light-based inhibition protocol we developed to inhibit Brachypodium seed germination during spaceflight could not be implemented because it required continuous seed exposure to blue-light and cold, thereby requiring excessive amounts of energy during a sensitive period of spaceflight.   Our flight experiment and corresponding ground control involved a total of 15 APEX Growth Units per condition, including 12 for each experiment, and 3 spare units. Three distinct accessions of Brachypodium distachyon were used, including Bd21 (whose genome serves as a reference for Brachypodium), Bd21-3 (which has been optimized for use in transformation experiments), and Gaz-8 (which displays different root-growth behaviors relative to Bd21 and Bd21-3 when grown on the ground). Four chambers (biological repeats) per accession were tested under microgravity conditions on ISS, and another four were exposed to 1-g on the ground under conditions that mimicked the flight experiment (ground control).\nThis material was prepared for flight to the ISS on March 27-30, 2018, and launched on Space X-14 on April 2, 2018. Upon transferring the 12 seeded APEX growth chambers from stowage into the ISS, astronaut Scott Tingle activated the experiment by injecting growth medium into the units on April 12, 2018. Seeds were allowed to germinate in the presence of red light for 24 hours, then blue and green lights were turned on and the plants were allowed to grow for three more days. At the end of this growth period, astronaut Tingle collected each APEX growth unit, took photographs of the seedlings growing on each face of the foam block, harvested the seedlings and placed them into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFT) for fixation in the presence of RNAlater. For each APEX Growth Unit, a few seedlings displayed roots that grew away from the foam surface and showed evidence of stress. These seedlings were harvested separately from those whose root tips were still contacting the block surface at harvesting time. Fixation in RNAlater was carried out at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The KFTs were then transferred to a cold storage device (-80°C) and returned to the ground on the Dragon capsule.\nThe environmental conditions experienced by the plants during their growth in VEGGIE on ISS were recorded, and then recapitulated in plant growth units at KSC during a first ground-based control. At the end of this experiment, the seedlings were also fixed in RNAlater at room temperature for 24 hours, then frozen at -80°C. These ground-control samples were also returned to the Principal Investigator (PI) laboratory, as were the pictures of seedlings grown under both microgravity and 1-g conditions.\nMicrogravity-grown seedlings are morphologically altered compared to ground-controls   The pictures of Brachypodium seedlings taken after 4 days of growth in the APEX Growth Units under microgravity and on the ground, were used to evaluate a potential effect of ISS-microgravity exposure on organs growth and seedling morphology. Seedlings of all three accessions displayed significantly shorter roots when grown under microgravity relative to ground controls. Furthermore, the shoots of microgravity-grown Bd21 seedlings were also shorter than ground controls, whereas those of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 were similar under both conditions. We conclude that Brachypodium distachyon accessions display distinct adaptive responses to the microgravity environment encountered on ISS. In addition to accession-specific alterations of organs growth, we also observed that the primary roots of microgravity-grown seedlings displayed longer root hairs than those of ground-control samples, and this phenotype was observed for all three accessions tested. This phenotype is rather surprising as previous studies had shown an opposite effect of microgravity on Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs (4).\nBrachypodium distachyon seedlings display organ-specific transcriptional responses to microgravity relative to ground control\nTo better understand the mechanisms that contribute to Brachypodium seedling adaptation to the microgravity environment of ISS, root and shoot tissues were dissected from frozen fixed Bd21 seedlings that had been exposed to the microgravity environment on ISS as well as ground-control materials. Total RNAs were extracted from these tissues and used to build TruSeq Stranded Total RNA libraries, which were sequenced in a Novaseq sequencer programmed to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. Library sequencing generated an average of 25 to 30 million reads per sample. Reads were trimmed to remove the adapter sequences using SKEWER, then filtered with FASTX_quality_filter to ensure that only high-quality reads (Phred scores above 35) are used for sequence alignments. The quality-filtered reads were mapped on the Brachypodium reference genome (version 3.1, from Phytozome) using the Bowtie2 algorithm. The TopHat 2 splice-junction mapper was used to compile transcript contigs, paying close attention to potential splice variants. HTseq-count was then used to define the numbers of reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) for genes and isoforms in each analyzed sample. DESeq (1) was used to normalize the numbers of reads and identify significantly differentially expressed transcripts. EdgeR (9) was also used as an alternative method to identify differentially expressed genes, and genes identified as significantly differentially expressed by both packages were retained for further analysis. The results of our DESeq comparisons are presented below.\nA principle component analysis (PCA) of expression profiles between experimental repeats revealed separate clustering between ground-control and microgravity-exposed samples, suggesting that there is more variation in expression profiles between environmental conditions than there is between repeats within a condition. Furthermore, ground-control root samples grouped more tightly in a sub-region of the PCA graph than those from microgravity-exposed root samples, suggesting a larger variation in expression profiles between repeats of the microgravity-exposed root samples relative to the ground controls.\nAnalysis of differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control seedlings identified 661 and 267 up-regulated genes in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively, relative to ground controls. Additionally, 1015 and 505 genes were found to be down-regulated in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively. A Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of these differentially expressed genes revealed an over-representation of genes potentially involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species and radiation, amongst other things.\nEven though many genes ended up being differentially expressed between microgravity and ground control samples, most were organ-specific. This is consistent with similar observations made with Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (5; 7). In fact, only 90 of the significantly differentially expressed genes are shared between roots and shoots. Of these, 35 are up-regulated and 30 down-regulated in both roots and shoots under microgravity. These genes constitute excellent candidates for a contribution to plant adaptive response to the microgravity environment of ISS. The remaining genes display opposite responses between shoots and roots. Several investigations of Arabidopsis seedling adaptation to spaceflight have also uncovered evidence of transcriptional responses involving genes that contribute to environmental and oxidative stress responses, as well as responses to reactive oxygen species (2-4; 6-8). On the other hand, our observation of enhanced expression of genes involved in radiation response under microgravity on ISS is particularly interesting considering the risks of exposure to cosmic radiations encountered by living organisms during spaceflight.\nA limited number of Brachypodium distachyon genes found to respond to the microgravity environment of ISS also respond to GS and/or MS on the ground.\nBecause Brachypodium distachyon seedling-organ responses to GS had not been previously characterized, we carried out a second ground-control experiment in this project, aimed at identifying genes whose expression is significantly altered in response to GS and/or MS. We germinated and grew Brachypodium Bd21-accession seeds in APEX Growth Chambers, within a VEGGIE growth unit at KSC under conditions that were programmed to mimic those recorded on ISS during the spaceflight experiment. After 4 days of growth, the APEX growth units were either gravity-stimulated by 180° reorientation, mechano-stimulated by 360° rotation, or not stimulated (control), and the seedlings were allowed to grow in their new orientation for an additional 5 min. Each treatment involved four repeats (four APEX Growth units). After stimulation, the seedlings were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (7/19/2018), then frozen at -80°C after 1 day at room temperature. These samples were returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and dissected to separate shoot and root tissues. RNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed (activated or repressed) in response to GS or MS. Similar sequence-analysis packages were used as those described above for RNASeq analysis of Brachypodium organ responses to microgravity.\nThis analysis revealed only small numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes between GS-/MS-induced samples and ground controls. It is, however, particularly compelling to note that 10 genes were found to be differentially expressed in response to both GS and microgravity exposure in roots. Six of these genes were repressed upon GS and activated upon exposure to microgravity, whereas the other four genes were activated in response to GS and repressed by exposure to microgravity. Therefore, these 10 genes constitute strong candidates for a contribution to gravity response in roots. They will be subjected to functional characterization.\nEqually interesting is another list of 10 genes that are transcriptionally responsive to both MS and microgravity exposure. Of these, eight were found to be down-regulated in response to MS and up-regulated upon exposure to microgravity, one was up-regulated in response to MS and down-regulated in response to microgravity, and the last one was found to be up-regulated in response to both treatments. One of these genes was also found in the list of 10 genes that are responsive to both GS and microgravity exposure. Overall, the latter group of 10 genes jointly regulated by MS and microgravity exposure are likely to contribute to plant responses to their mechanical environment. They will also be prioritized for further functional characterization.\nIn conclusion, we note that a vast majority of the genes found to be differentially expressed upon GS or MS on the ground are not transcriptionally responsive to the microgravity conditions experienced on ISS, suggesting that Brachypodium seedling organs interpret the microgravity environment of ISS very differently from GS and/or MS on the ground. This observation holds true for both shoot and root samples. It is compatible with similar observations made by others using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model (2-4; 6-8). A manuscript describing this work is in preparation.\nUsing a Genome-Wide Association Study approach to identify loci that contribute to root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior in Brachypodium distachyon seedlings\nIn addition to the APEX-06 experiment described above, we have also completed our comparative analysis of root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior on agar surfaces for 46 distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions, using time lapse-analysis of root-growth behavior coupled with automated computer-driven biometric analysis of imaged roots. Our quantitative analysis of root growth behavior included determinations of root growth rates, root tip angles from the vertical, and elemental curvatures along the roots.\nWhen growing on vertical plates, Brachypodium roots from most accessions grow straight down, as dictated by gravitropism. However, while doing so, the root-tip also tends to curve leftward and rightward of the vertical. The tip curvatures associated with these oscillations typically disappear as the differentially elongated cells migrate from the distal side of the elongation zone to more proximal regions, an auto-straightening process that is reminiscent of proprioception in animal systems. Upon 90-degree reorientation within the gravity field (gravity stimulation), the roots initiate a phase of rapid downward bending, which is followed by a second, slower phase of curvature response that is accompanied by root-tip oscillations similar to those preceding the gravity stimulus. Distinct Brachypodium accessions differ from each other in the frequency and amplitude of their root tip oscillations, as well as in the bending rate following gravity stimulation.\nTo better capture the genetic basis of variation between accessions for these traits, we developed a mathematical model that recapitulates the evolution of root tip angles from the vertical before, during and after gravity stimulation. When applied to the 46 accessions under investigation, this model is very effective at recapitulating accession-specific growth behaviors, with best-fit curves correlating well with the observed data (R-square larger than 0.9). These best-fit equations, along with Fast Fourier Transform analysis, allowed estimation of descriptive parameters for these behaviors, including root growth rate, rapid bending rates during phase 1 of gravitropism, and frequency and amplitude of oscillations.\nBecause each one of these 46 accessions had previously been subjected to genome sequencing, we were able to use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with these parameters. This analysis allowed us to identify linked loci whose contribution to oscillatory root growth behavior are being investigated using a combination of expression analysis, reverse genetics and cell biology approaches. A paper describing this research is also being prepared for publication.\nBroader Impact of Our Work\nOverall, these studies may impact our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of coordinated cell expansion and its roles in growth regulation, plant morphogenesis and plant organs' growth responses and adaptation to gravity and/or microgravity. In the longer term, our studies may enable us to engineer plants that are better suited to function as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space exploration missions, or more simply for effective growth and productivity in natural and/or agricultural ecosystems on Earth.\nNew Technology Development: The foam-based vessel (APEX Growth Chamber) we developed in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the KSC Flight Support Team has been submitted to NASA Technology Transfer System (KSC-14282).\nCited Literature\n1.

Bioinformatics 26:139-40\nJUNE 2019 REPORT: As summarized in our previous progress reports, we developed a novel plant growth unit (named APEX growth chamber) to support the growth of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings under microgravity in the International Space Station (ISS). This system is based on an Oasis foam-based growth device previously used by Dr. Howard Levine to grow plants in space (NASA Space Biology Program).  Our units were designed in a collaborative effort involving Dr. Levine and the NASA Flight Support Team. With this system, seeds are inserted pre-flight into a dry block of foam, which is mounted on a medium injection device within a Magenta box. The seeds are kept in a dormant dry state, unable to germinate during spaceflight to the ISS. When the experiment is ready for initiation on ISS, an astronaut can easily inject liquid growth medium into the foam support through the injection device, thereby imbibing the seeds and triggering their germination under red light.\nThe flight experiment and corresponding ground control were carried out in March 2018 (APEX-06 mission). These experiments involved a total of 15 APEX Growth Units per condition, including 12 for each experiment and 3 spare ones. Three distinct accessions of Brachypodium distachyon were used, including Bd21 (whose genome serves as a reference for Brachypodium), BD21-3 (which has been optimized for use in transformation experiments), and Gaz-8 (which displays different root growth behaviors relative to Bd21 and Bd21-3 when grown on the ground). Four chambers (biological repeats) per accession were tested under microgravity conditions on ISS, and another four were exposed to 1-g on the ground under conditions that mimicked the flight experiment (ground control).\nAs previously reported, this material was prepared for flight to the ISS on March 27-30, 2018, and launched on SpaceX-14 on April 2, 2018. Upon transferring the 12 seeded APEX growth chambers from stowage into the ISS, astronaut Scott Tingle activated the experiment by injecting growth medium into the units on April 12, 2018.  Seeds were allowed to germinate in the presence of red light for 24 hours, then blue and green lights were turned on and the plants were allowed to grow for three more days. At the end of this growth period, astronaut Tingle collected each APEX growth unit, took photographs of each face, harvested the seedlings, and placed them into KFT for fixation in the presence of RNAlater. For each APEX Growth Unit, a few seedlings displayed roots that grew away from the foam surface and showed evidence of stress. These seedlings were harvested separately from those whose root tips were still contacting the block surface at harvesting time. Fixation in RNAlater was carried out at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The KFTs were then transferred to a cold storage device (-80°C) and returned to the ground on the Dragon capsule.\nThe environmental conditions experienced by the plants during their growth period in VEGGIE on ISS were recorded, and then recapitulated in plant growth units at KSC during a first ground-based control. At the end of this experiment, the seedlings were also fixed in RNAlater. After similar storage under -80°C conditions, the samples were returned to the Principal Investigator (PI) laboratory, as were the pictures of seedlings grown under both microgravity and 1-g conditions. As reported last year, seedlings grown under microgravity displayed significant root-growth inhibition compared to ground controls for all accessions tested. The shoots of microgravity-grown Bd21 seedlings were also shorter than ground control, but those of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 were similar under both gravity conditions. We conclude that distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display distinct adaptive responses to the microgravity environment encountered on ISS. In addition to accession-specific slight alterations of organs growth, we also observed that the primary roots of microgravity-grown seedlings displayed longer root hairs than those of ground-control samples.\nTo better understand the mechanisms that contribute to Brachypodium seedlings adaptation to the microgravity environment of ISS, root and shoot tissues were dissected from frozen fixed Bd21 seedlings that had been exposed to the microgravity environment on ISS as well as ground-control material. Total RNAs were extracted from these tissues and used to build TruSeq Stranded Total RNA libraries, which were sequenced in a Novaseq sequencer programmed to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. Library sequencing generated an average of 25 to 30 million reads per sample. Sequence analysis involved a pipeline that included FastQC to control for the quality of sequence reads and filter out poor reads, Tophat2 to align each reads to the reference Brachypodium genome, Bowtie2 to build an index, HTseq to count the number of reads assigned to each annotated gene/transcript, and DEseq (R package) to evaluate differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control samples.\nA principle component analysis (PCA) of expression profiles between experimental repeats revealed separate clustering between ground-control and microgravity-exposed samples, suggesting that there is more variation in expression profiles between environmental conditions than there is between repeats within a condition. Furthermore, ground-control root samples grouped more tightly in a sub-region of the PCA graph than those from microgravity-exposed root samples, suggesting a larger variation in expression profiles exists between repeats of the microgravity-exposed root samples relative to the ground controls.\nInitial analysis of differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control seedlings identified 398 and 159 significantly up-regulated genes in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively, relative to ground controls. Additionally, 867 and 380 significantly down-regulated genes were found in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively. A Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of these differentially expressed genes revealed an over-representation of genes potentially involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli and oxidative stress, amongst other things.\nBecause the Brachypodium distachyon seedling organ responses to gravity stimulation have not been well characterized, we also carried out a second control experiment in this project, aimed at identifying genes whose expression is significantly altered in response to gravity- and/or mechano-stimulation.  As reported last year, we germinated and grew Bd21 seeds in APEX Growth Chambers, within a VEGGIE unit, under growth conditions that were programmed to mimic those recorded on ISS during the spaceflight experiment. After four days of growth, the APEX growth units were either gravity-stimulated by 180° reorientation, mechano-stimulated by 360° rotation, or unstimulated (control), and the seedlings were allowed to grow in their new position for five minutes. Each stimulus involved four repeats (four APEX Growth units). After 5-min incubations, the seedlings were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (7/19/2018), then frozen at -80°C after one day of fixation. These samples were returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where each sample was dissected to separate shoot and root tissues. RNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed between treatments. Currently, the analytical pipeline described above is being used to analyze the RNAseq profiles and identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed (activated or repressed) in response to mechano- or gravity-stimulation. The groups of genes found to be differentially expressed under microgravity on ISS will be compared to those that are differentially expressed in response to gravity- or mechano-stimulation under 1-g. Reverse genetics will then be used to investigate the contribution of these genes to plant responses to microgravity, gravity- or mechano-stimulation.\nIn addition to the APEX-06 experiment described above, we have also completed our comparative analysis of root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior on agar surfaces for 45 distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions, using time lapse-analysis of root growth behavior coupled with automated computer-driven biometric analysis of imaged roots. Our quantitative analysis of root growth behavior included determinations of root growth rates, root tip angles from the vertical, and elemental curvatures along the roots.\nWhen growing on vertical plates, Brachypodium roots from most accessions grow straight down, as dictated by gravitropism. However, while doing so, the root-tip also tends to curve leftward and rightward of the vertical. The tip curvatures associated with these oscillations typically disappear as the differentially elongated cells migrate from the distal side of the elongation zone to more proximal regions, an auto-straightening process that is reminiscent of proprioception in animal systems.

These best-fit equations, along with Fast Fourier Transform analysis, allowed estimation of descriptive parameters for these behaviors, including root growth rate, rapid bending rates during phase 1 of gravitropism, and frequency and amplitude of oscillations.\nBecause each one of these 45 accessions had previously been subjected to genome sequencing, we were able to use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with these parameters. SNPs showing significant probabilities of association with several growth parameters including the maximal rate of rapid bending and the amplitude of oscillations, have been identified and are being characterized. Overall, these studies have allowed us to identify linked loci whose contribution to oscillatory root growth behavior are being investigated using a combination of expression analysis, reverse genetics and cell biology approaches.\nOverall, these studies may impact our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of coordinated cell expansion and its roles in growth regulation, plant morphogenesis, and plant organs' growth responses and adaptation to gravity and/or microgravity.

            "task_description": "This research has capitalized on the capabilities of the VEGGIE hardware to address how spaceflight affects plant gene expression and growth related to low oxygen stress (hypoxia). Hypoxia is thought to develop in spaceflight as weightlessness nullifies the buoyancy-driven convection that usually aids in mixing and supplying gas (oxygen) around organisms. Our analysis of Arabidopsis grown on the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the BRIC17 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiment is consistent with the plants grown in space having experienced long-term hypoxic stress. These plants also showed hallmarks of up-regulating Ca2+- and reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) pathways (such as those supported by the enzyme RBOHD). Further, we have identified a Ca2+ transporter named CAX2 as playing a critical role in this hypoxic signaling system. We therefore have used the plant growth capabilities of the VEGGIE to significantly extend our insights into hypoxic stress. Wild-type, rbohD, and cax2 mutant seedlings were grown on orbit. After 8 days, samples were photographed, fixed in RNAlater using Kennedy Fixation Tubes, and frozen for subsequent post-flight analysis. For analysis, we have quantified patterns of growth and gene expression using the techniques of RNAseq and qPCR. In addition, analysis of a ROS reporter gene tagged with green fluorescent protein has been made using fluorescence microscopy. Comparison to plants grown on the ground help define how much of the responses seen on orbit can be explained by the development of long-term hypoxia linked to the microgravity environment. Results from this analysis are expected to advance our understanding of hypoxic response in plants grown in both space and on Earth in addition to testing whether the hypoxic Ca2+ signaling system provides targets for genetically engineering potential countermeasures to low oxygen stress.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research has addressed how spaceflight may induce stresses related to reduced oxygen availability in plants. The work has targeted the role of Ca2+ signaling and reactive oxygen species as components of this response to define molecular components of the system. The results from this work will both provide insight into a potentially important element of spaceflight-related stress and also help to define elements of the low oxygen response system that operates on Earth. Plants on Earth experience such conditions during flooding of the soil, when there is a large microbial population in the soil consuming available oxygen and even when the metabolic activities within the plant's own tissues are intense enough to consume available oxygen. These natural low oxygen events are sensed by plants and can lead to either changes in growth and development to accommodate or escape them, or in extreme cases they can lead to significant losses in productivity and even death. These spaceflight experiments on low oxygen sensing mechanisms will therefore help provide molecular targets for potential manipulation to help make plants more tolerant of low oxygen and so contribute to agronomically important traits such as flooding tolerance in crop plants."

            "task_progress": "APEX-05 mission and sample analyses: APEX05 successfully launched on SpaceX-13. Plants were grown on orbit in the Veggie hardware, were returned frozen, and gene expression analysis using RNAseq also successfully completed. The experimental plants grew for 8 days on orbit and showed the expected levels of vigorous development, comparable to the parallel ground controls. All flight success criteria and subsequent sample analyses were in the excellent range.\nThe overarching hypothesis for the APEX05 experimental design is that spaceflight imposes hypoxic and oxidative stress that will be disrupted in the cax2 and atrbohd mutants and that this will be reflected in the patterns of gene expression from plants growing on orbit. This idea is supported by direct analysis of various Arabidopsis ecotypes grown on the ISS and by comparison of the transcriptional responses from multiple plant spaceflight experiments analyzed using the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database, which aggregates much of the available data in this area. Comparison of gene expression patterns in flight vs ground samples for APEX-05 indicate these ideas are likely correct. The wild type control plants showed patterns of gene expression consistent with both hypoxia and oxidative stress as well as reduction in both root and shoot growth when compared to ground controls.\nAPEX-05 cax2 responses: The hypoxia resistant cax2 mutants showed reduced induction of hypoxia-related transcripts in spaceflight. Consistent with these observations, the cax2 mutants also showed high basal expression of several molecular markers of hypoxic response, suggesting they were constitutively adapted to hypoxia, even when O2 levels were normal. Further, in ground-based controls on Earth showed these mutants were resistant to hypoxia and to flooding stress (another low oxygen environment), again consistent with a constant hypoxia response pre-adapting them to this stress. CAX2 is a Ca2+ pump that should attenuate the Ca2+ signaling triggered by low oxygen levels and the cax2 mutants showed elevated basal Ca2+ levels and significantly higher hypoxia-induced Ca2+ signals, providing a potential mechanism for their constitutive and enhanced low O2 stress resilience.\nAPEX-05 rbohd responses: The wild-type plants in space also showed evidence of the induction of genes responsive to oxidative stress, such as a suite of molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein family. These genes were not induced in the rbohD mutant, which maintained growth in spaceflight above levels of the wild type control plants. In ground controls, the rbohd mutants also showed resistance to hypoxic and flooding stresses, suggesting hypoxia and ROS signaling may be intimately interrelated in spaceflight responses.\nGround-based analyses: As part of these studies a series of ground-based analyses have been conducted to help either develop assays for the spaceflight experiments, or to better define the Ca2+ and ROS-based signaling in plants likely triggered by spaceflight. An improved red-light based system to impose dormancy on Arabidopsis seeds to aid in their transfer to orbit for APEX-05 has been developed and a collaboration with the Townsend group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has led to production of a hyperspectral imaging system to investigate how this technology might be applied to monitoring plant stress in growth chamber environments such as the Veggie hardware used for APEX-05. During analyses of signaling events, a new plant-wide ROS and Ca2+ signaling system based on propagating waves of Ca2+ has been revealed. Additionally, a new transcriptional reporter for monitoring the dynamics of ROS-imposed stress throughout the plant has been developed.\nPresentations and Outreach/Education: The APEX-05 project has been presented at numerous national and international meetings including regularly at the Plant Cell Dynamics Meeting, the ISS Research and Development Conference, the annual meetings of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, and the American Society of Plant Biology, and at university venues ranging from South Dakota State to the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. APEX-05 has also been central to a series of outreach activities, being regularly presented at events ranging from University of Wisconsin sponsored outreach days (e.g., University of Wisconsin’s Science Expeditions) to presentations for high school students, undergraduates, and middle school and K-12 teachers (such as regularly at the BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute summer training program for teachers). APEX-05 has also been featured in some unique mentoring opportunities such as to multiple groups participating in the plant space biology themed First Lego League Championship over 2018-2019. Multiple cohorts of undergraduates have also participated in designing and fabricating hardware such as the red-light dormancy inducing system used in the APEX-05 flight or clinostats and low O2 chambers used in the ground-based controls for the APEX-05 experimentation.",

Change in organism used in this project, approved by NASA Headquarters.\nEnterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic human pathogen consistently isolated and detected by molecular analysis on board the International Space Station (ISS). The ability of this organism to survive outside of the human gut may have important implications for its spread to a new host environment.  The goal of this study is to characterize the desiccation survival capacity of ISS isolated E. faecalis strains and to investigate their pathogenicity in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. First, we shall provide the first comparative genomic information of E. faecalis strains to characterize strain-specific sequence variants and the identification of traits that may confer increased resistance to desiccation and antibiotics. We will also examine the presence of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) that confer bacterial resistance to foreign DNA and may provide an additional method of persistence to the transfer of mobile genetic elements. Phenotypic data will determine how desiccation tolerance varies, and how these variations relate to the clinical and commensal strain types. In vivo pathogenicity tests will culminate our investigation into the effect of E. faecalis biofilm morphotypes on the ability to establish infection in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. This work will help to determine genomic, phenotypic, and physiological basis for various desiccation and antibiotic resistance of ISS isolated E. faecalis, and provide insight to pathogenicity of spaceflight isolated microorganisms, where astronaut immunity is decreased and the availability of antibiotics is limited.",

Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS).

Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms. By harnessing the technology already onboard the ISS, the crew will then be able to achieve near-real time detection of isolates that may impact crew health.",

The objectives of the ISS-MOP project are to measure presence of viral and select bacterial and fungal pathogens and correlate their presence on crew. The effects of the spaceflight environment on viral and microbial pathogen dynamics are largely unknown and represent both a significant gap in our knowledge and an important opportunity to study the presence of microbial populations and predict health risks during long-term space exploration.\nThe hypothesis of the ISS-MOP project is that certain short-living viruses associated with inert environmental spaces in the closed habitat of the ISS can have an adverse influence on crew health. To test this hypothesis the team will catalog viruses associated with surfaces and air of the ISS modules using the all-encompassing Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array (LLMDA), which contains probes to detect not only viruses but also clinically important human bacterial and fungal pathogens. In addition, skin and saliva samples from crewmembers will be requested to test the hypothesis.\nThere are three aims proposed in this ISS-MOP project. While the cultivation-based assay (Aim 1) provides a valid estimation of microbial presence, it offers only a limited assessment of the phylogenetic/pathogenic diversity and physiological breadth of the microbial population present. Therefore, the team will use the novel and comprehensive LLMDA microarray, which is specifically designed to elucidate the pathogenic viral and microbial diversity profiles of complex samples to at least the species level (Aim 2). In addition, we will characterize the virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms associated with these pathogens from the ISS by developing a new Virulence and Antibiotic Resistance gene array and analyze the samples on this array. The final deliverable of the proposed project to NASA will be the ISS-MOP dataset, a compilation of all of the genomic sequences and genetic information of viruses and microbes encountered on and within the ISS habitat (Aim 3).\nThe objectives of the ISS-MOP project directly respond to the National Research Council Committee for the Decadal Survey on Biological and Physical Sciences in Space recommendation P1 where it states, “to establish a microbial observatory program on the ISS to conduct long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics.” The ISS-MOP project will also provide answers to NASA Space Biology Guiding Questions: How do alterations in gravity affect in microbial cells (CMM1); Does the enhanced virulence or other genetic changes observed with microbial cultures flown in space occur in other species (CMM4); and What are the genetic changes underlying physiological responses to spaceflight demonstrated in biological systems (CMM5).",

            "task_progress": "The International Space Station (ISS) is a uniquely enclosed environment that has been continuously occupied for the last two decades. Throughout its operation, protecting the health of the astronauts on board has been a high priority. The human microbiome plays a significant role in maintaining human health, and disruptions in the microbiome have been linked to various diseases. To evaluate the effects of spaceflight on the human microbiome, body swabs and saliva samples were collected from four ISS astronauts on consecutive expeditions. Astronaut samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and microarrays to characterize the microbial biodiversity before, during, and after the astronauts’ time on board the ISS. Samples were evaluated at an individual and population level to identify changes in microbial diversity and abundance. No significant changes in the number or relative abundance of taxa were observed between collection time points when samples from all four astronauts were analyzed together. When the astronauts’ saliva samples were analyzed individually, the saliva samples of some astronauts showed significant changes in the relative abundance of taxa during and after spaceflight. The relative abundance of Prevotella in saliva samples increased during two astronauts’ time on board the ISS, while the relative abundance of other commensal taxa, such as Neisseria, Rothia and Haemophilus, decreased. The abundance of some antimicrobial resistance genes within the saliva samples also showed significant changes. Most notably, elfamycin resistance gene significantly increased in all four astronauts post-flight and a CfxA6 beta-lactam marker significantly increased during spaceflight but returned to normal levels post-flight. The combination of both shotgun metagenomic sequencing and microarrays showed the benefit of both technologies in monitoring microbes on board the ISS. There were some changes in each astronaut’s microbiome during spaceflight, but these changes were not universal for all four astronauts. Two antimicrobial resistance gene markers did show a significant change in abundance in the saliva samples of all four astronauts across their collection times. These results provide insight for future ISS microbial monitoring studies and targets for antimicrobial resistance screenings.\nThe microorganisms present on ISS surfaces originate from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights, over another year and a half.  Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA, extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide to detect intact/viable cells, or left untreated, to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells. Treated and untreated DNA were analyzed; metagenomics analysis was also conducted on the DNA samples. Culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses were also performed to supplement the metagenomics results. The overall number of microbial species detected at each time point did not significantly change, but species profiles did. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant changes in the microbial populations between sampling time points but not across surface locations. The observed antimicrobial resistance gene profiles for the ISS surface samples were more stable over time, both temporally and spatially, with 29 antimicrobial resistance genes detected across all samples.  Metagenomic assembled genomes were able to be reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 metagenomic assembled genomes, which provided further insight into the functional capabilities of the microbiome of this unique built environment. The populations of bacteria and fungi collected from the eight ISS surfaces remained similar between locations but changed over the course of a year and a half. The microbial communities were dominated by organisms associated with the human skin, indicating a large exchange between the astronaut crewmembers and the ISS surfaces. Despite the changes in the microbial community, the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes was stable, indicating the persistence of genetic redundancy.",

This alone will provide critical and important information regarding the effects of these inducers on EBV reactivation in humans.  Clearly, after these molecular events are established in EBV, possible parallel mechanisms in VZV and CMV can be investigated in future studies. Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is 1 of the 8 human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well-documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood.\nWe studied the effect of 4 different types of radiation, (1) 137Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as 4 days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biologic effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points.",

            "task_description": "Maintaining musculoskeletal health during long-duration spaceflight is crucial for ensuring both mission success and full skeletal recovery upon returning to weight-bearing. Clinical and preclinical evidence indicates that cartilage degradation in the hip and knee joints occurs with reduced weight-bearing. Less well characterized are the damaging effects of spaceflight-relevant radiation on cartilage, including exposure to solar particle events (SPE).  Deterioration of the hip and knee joint during prolonged spaceflight has the potential to reduce an astronaut’s performance during a mission, cause arthritis, and negatively impact the astronaut’s long-term quality of life (QOL). Our study will test the hypothesis that mouse hip and knee joints exposed to microgravity on the International Space Station (ISS) or from reduced weight bearing via tail-suspended with or without exposure to spaceflight-relevant doses of radiation in Definition Phase studies will exhibit profound tissue degradation.  Additionally, this degradation can be recovered using aerobic (running) and resistance (climbing) exercise countermeasures.\nTo study these problems, we will determine the hip and knee joint damage that occurs in mice that will fly in space on the International Space Station for 30 days. This damage will be compared to the hip and knee joint damage in another group of mice kept on Earth that also will not have weight on the hip and knee joints for 30 days, with or without receiving radiation exposure that simulates a solar flare. Damage to the hip and knee joint structures will be determined using imaging techniques, engineering devices to measure tissue strength, stained tissue sections, and identification of the molecules that cause the damage. The ability to walk normally after 30 days of weightlessness will also be determined. Finally, we will determine if treadmill running or climbing can reverse any of the hip and knee joint damage caused by being in the weightless space environment.\nOur goal is to determine, 1] if hip and knee joint damage occurs in the weightless space environment, and 2] if recovery from this damage is possible with exercise.",

Our final conclusion was that spaceflight and reduced weight-bearing on the ground induce an arthritic response in the knees of mice, which can be reversed with a return to weight-bearing (after hindlimb unloading-HLU) if exercise is performed.  This final paper was submitted to Scientific Reports and published in the fall.  Moreover, the student who was working on the project as his dissertation research, Andy Kwok, wrote and defended his dissertation in Spring, 2021. [Ed. note: see Bibliography section for noted publications]\nANNUAL REPORTING SEPTEMBER 2020\nWe examined if reduced weight bearing on Earth using a hindlimb unloading (HU) model could cause damage to menisci and cartilage, as during spaceflight.  What we found was that in male and female mice, the degree of cartilage and meniscus damage was similar to what was observed after 30 days in space, and occurred at the same location (the region in the knee that supports most of the weight versus gravity).  Thus cartilage degradation, and meniscal loss, occurs with reduced weight bearing, and HU is a good analogue for joint damage that occurs during spaceflight.\nWe then identified that both running and climbing exercise can in part mitigate the damage to cartilage and menisci that is caused by reduced weight bearing.",

            "task_description": "Spaceflight factors, including microgravity and space radiation, are known to affect somatic stem cell-based tissue regeneration and cause significant degenerative conditions in multiple mammalian tissues, posing a significant risk for long-term human space exploration. Our previous spaceflight research has shown an inability of both embryonic and somatic stem cells to proliferate, differentiate, and regenerate damaged cells in microgravity conditions, which may be the cause of the widespread tissue degeneration observed in space. Our laboratory has recently published key evidence that spaceflight induces over expression of CDKN1a/p21, a master cell cycle and tissue regeneration inhibitor, in proliferating osteoprogenitor cells, potentially providing a molecular mechanism for spaceflight tissue regenerative deficits. In this proposal, we seek to test the hypothesis that the key molecular mechanism causing the degenerative effects of microgravity on adult stem cells is activation of cell cycle arrest and impairment of differentiation via CDKN1a/p21 overexpression. We specifically hypothesize that in microgravity, normal mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with the CDKN1a/p21 gene will be inhibited from proliferating and differentiating normally relative to 1g, but that mesenchymal stem cells from CDKN1a/p21-null mice will show unrestrained proliferation and differentiation that is not sensitive to microgravity conditions. To test this hypothesis, we are proposing a spaceflight experiment to Section B.2 ‘Mammalian Cell, Tissue and Organ Generation and Degeneration in Space’ of the NASA Research Announcement NNH14ZTT001N. We specifically propose to conduct an experiment in the NASA Bioculture System Hardware in which the stromal stem cell population isolated from bone marrow of CDKN1a/p21-null and wildtype mice will be taken to the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory frozen on the surface of collagen-coated alginate microcarrier beads, injected into bioreactors, and cultured in osteogenic medium to induce differentiation and mineralized bone nodule formation in a 30 day culture. The successful completion of this experiment will conclusively determine the role of CDKN1a/p21 in stem cell regenerative health in space. Specifically, if we observe inhibition of osteogenesis by microgravity in wildtype stem cells, but not in CDKN1a/p21-null cells, this will support our hypothesis that the induction of cell cycle arrest by microgravity in adult stem cells is a key molecular mechanism causing the observed degenerative effects of space on mammalian tissues. This will provide a new perspective on the problem of stem cell regenerative health and medicine in space as well as on Earth, and will provide fundamental insight into stem cell regenerative mechanisms that will aid our understanding of basic stem cell functions on Earth and in space. This research addresses NASA’s and the National Research Council's (NRC’s) Decadal Survey call to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of bone loss and to conduct basic research into the mechanisms of bone adaptation to microgravity using transgenic animal models. It also will address the call to understand the precise signaling mechanisms responsible for reduced bone formation in space. This research is highly significant, as it proposes to investigate a molecular mechanism, based on previous spaceflight results, that has the potential to explain and mitigate a broad range of microgravity induced tissue degenerative health conditions.\nNOTE: Project continues with a new grant 80NSSC20K1125 issued to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with the same Principal Investigator Dr. Elizabeth Blaber due to her move to RPI (Ed., 8/27/20)",

We found that cells without the CDKN1a/p21 gene from both juvenile and adult knock out mice exhibited increased bone formation potential as shown by increased proliferation rates and increased mineralized nodule formation. This increase in bone formation potential in-vitro was also seen in-vivo in juvenile mice but not in adult mice.\nDue to a delay in flight opportunities and hardware restriction, we modified the existing grant to achieve the same science goals but expand our ground-based definition studies to further characterize the role of CDKN1a/p21 on bone formation following increased mechanical loading and during aging. We found that CDKN1a/p21 is a load sensitive molecule due to the increased proliferation and mineralization observed during mechanical loading. Additionally, we found that CDKN1a/p21 plays a significant role in the arrest of bone formation during aging as evidenced by increased proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization potential seen in aged knockout mice. During this time, we have also continued to optimize the experimental parameters that will be used for the spaceflight studies. This included optimization of freeze/thaw conditions, optimization of small molecule slow release beads to maintain consistent levels over the course of the experiment, optimization of feeding schedules and media composition, and optimization of cell/bead numbers.\nNOTE: Project continues with a new grant 80NSSC20K1125 issued to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with the same Principal Investigator Dr. Elizabeth Blaber due to her move to RPI (Ed., 8/27/20)",

NASA indicated that a total of 20 mice were planned to be flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and 40 mice would serve as ground controls.  Four immunization treatment groups were part of the experimental protocol that was designed to assess the in vivo antibody responses during spaceflight.  In particular, the antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each of the treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatments.  Our group (Pecaut and Chapes) proposed to collect mouse liver, bone marrow, kidney/adrenal glands, and thymus to accomplish two specific aims.\n1.  Specific Aim 1:  Collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  These tissues would have been used to assess short- and long-term stress to the flight animals.\n2.  Specific Aim 2:  Collect liver and bone marrow.   These tissues would be used for the preparation of RNA to allow for a comparative analysis of B cell IgH usage between lymphoid compartments.\nWith the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and > or = 2 year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved to modify the aims of NNX15AB45G as follows:\n1.  Obtain liver tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research 1 (RR1) verification flight.  Preflight verification tests done as part of NNX15AB45G have shown that usable RNA cannot be obtained from bone marrow from frozen carcasses (using the freezing procedure currently used on ISS).  Therefore, we proposed to focus on liver tissue.  Liver RNA was available from the liver tissue (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 AEM ground controls).  We proposed to do MiSeq next generation sequencing on a group of flight and ground samples.  In addition, NASA GeneLab had done HiSeq next generation sequencing on some of the liver tissue flown on RR1.  We proposed to obtain those data. We proposed to determine IgH usage of the liver B cells in the mice (flight vs. ground controls).  One of our goals is to determine if there is tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.\n2.  An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) was proposed to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight (This experiment will be done as part of NNX13AN34G).  In this protocol, mice will be subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice will be immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS, CpG only, tetanus toxoid (TT) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections will be intraperitoneal (i.p.). Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we will obtain liver tissue from those mice.  We will directly assess the changes in IgH usage caused by immunization ± adjuvant (CpG) and will address the impact of skeletal unloading. One of our original goals was to examine the impact of spaceflight on host B cell responsiveness in different tissue compartments.  Therefore, this experiment was expected to partially fulfill the goals of Aim 1 of the original grant by using AOS as a spaceflight model.  We proposed to  compare the impact of skeletal unloading using AOS on host responsiveness to antigen challenge and address the issue of tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.       In addition to the IgH usage studies, we proposed to collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  The data obtained from these tissue analyses will be used to assess short- and long-term stress to AOS animals.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Spaceflight offers a unique environment that impacts many physiological systems. This occurs not only in humans but also in rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.  Among these systems, bone and the immune response are connected and are known to be significantly altered by the skeletal unloading of spaceflight.  B lymphocytes are one of the cells that develop in the bone marrow.  They make antibodies in response to infection or immunization with vaccines.  Moreover, the B cells that protect people from disease after receiving immunizations localize to the bone marrow as well as other lymphoid organs.  We will obtain valuable information about what changes occur in the B-cell populations that develop in lymphoid organs such as liver and compare the development of these B-cell populations found in other lymphoid compartments.  This understanding will tell us if more precautions are necessary on Earth when people are skeletally unloaded.  On Earth, skeletal unloading occurs to individuals that are bedridden for long periods of time, wheel-chair bound, or lose the ability to stand for long periods of time.  Therefore, the space environment provides an accelerated view of what will happen to individuals that must endure these prolonged periods of skeletal unloading.   This experiment will have direct relevance to individuals on Earth."

            "task_progress": "Work Completed to accomplish Specific Aim 1\nAnalysis of Rodent Research 1 liver data\nWe analyzed GeneLab data sequencing data that was available from the GeneLab data base, GLDS-47, GLDS-48.  The number of immunoglobulin reads (either heavy or light chain) were quite low, less than 1% of what we had obtained in preliminary analysis of spleen cells and tissue.  We first attributed this low yield to short sequencing reads from the HiSeq sequencing method that the GeneLab did and provided in the database.  Therefore, we sequenced both splenic (funded by another grant) and liver RNA from the Rodent Research 1 (RR1) validation flight, which was made available by the NASA Ames Research Center (n=3 ground, n=3 flight). RNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (275bp, 2x) at the Kansas State Integrated Genomics Facility. Sequencing data was quality trimmed using CLC genomics workbench and mapped to reference libraries obtained from ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database. Datasets were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for CDR3 characterization.\nThe analysis of liver vs. spleen reads indicated that liver immunoglobulin gene reads range from 0.26% of spleen immunoglobulin gene reads to 0.91%.  The number of reads ranges from less than 100 to no greater than 622, depending on the sample.  Although useful, publishable data from the spleen was obtained (data presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, Poster #120, and presented in the GeneLab workshop by Chapes and Ward) and the liver sequencing did not provide much usable meaningful immunoglobulin gene data, even when the more comprehensive MiSeq next generation sequencing platform is used to sequence.  The liver data that we did obtain was published in our publication on the RR1 flight (Life Sciences in Space Research, 2018--See Bibliography section below).  Other data from the MiSeq NGS data sets will be useful for other data mining attempts and was made available to the GeneLab.  Therefore, these sequencing runs will provide a rich data source.\nAssessment of the bone marrow B-cell repertoire\nBecause our specific aim to examine the liver for IgH V, D, and J gene segment usage and IgL for V and J gene segment was not successful, we received permission to assess bone marrow.  Bone marrow is an important, essential immune compartment for the storage of B cell plasma and memory cells (Erickson, Lin et al. 2003; Cariappa, Chase et al. 2007).  Although preflight verification tests indicated that sequence quality RNA could not be obtained from bone marrow from frozen carcasses (using the freezing procedure currently used on ISS), usable, bone marrow RNA was obtained from the mice used in the AOS experiment.\nWe used skeletal unloading with the antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) model to simulate some of the physiological effects associated with spaceflight. Loaded and unloaded animals were challenged with tetanus toxoid (TT) and/or CpG, an adjuvant.  Two weeks after challenge, bone marrow was collected and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq 2x300 platform. The resulting antibody repertoire was characterized, including V-, D- (heavy only), and J-gene segment usage, constant region usage, CDR3 length, and V(D)J combinations. We detected changes in gene-segment usage in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatment in both the heavy and light chains. Additionally, changes were seen in the class-switched VH-gene repertoire. Alterations were also detected in V/J pairing for both the heavy and light chains, and changes in CDR3 length. We also detected lower levels of CDR3 AA overlap than detected in the splenic repertoire. These results demonstrate that AOS, TT, and CpG altered the bone marrow antibody repertoire.\nWhen we compared the bone marrow repertoire to the spleen B cell repertoire, there appear to be some differences in the bone marrow repertoire compared to the spleen.  However, there was no evidence to suggest that AOS has a significant negative impact on the natural B cell responses or the Ig rearrangements that normally occur in response to antigen treatment in the bone marrow.  Additional spleen and bone marrow comparisons are planned in the future and some antigen specific VDJ gene combinations that are necessary for TT-specific responses will also be assessed in the future.\nA manuscript entitled “Effects of skeletal unloading on the bone marrow antibody repertoire of tetanus toxoid and/or CpG treated C57BL/6J mice” is in preparation at the time of the submission of this report and will be submitted in March 2019.\nAssessment of the mouse B-cell repertoire in normal mice flown to the ISS\nAs part of our RR1 work and specific aim 1, we utilized high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the ISS during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals; however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Ig (kappa) gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that spaceflight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.  Therefore, we successfully completed our modified specific aim one and we were able to successfully characterize immunoglobulin gene segment usage and junctional diversity within the antibody repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS.   Although individual gene segment usage remained similar among animals within and among treatment groups, with the most abundant gene segments being conserved across all animals, gene segment combinations and CDR3 sequences were highly varied, demonstrating the combinatorial diversity of the antibody repertoire, but that variation reflects the dynamics of individualized selection of Ig molecules and not any impact of spaceflight. A larger sample size would help solidify this conclusion, but these data provide preliminary suggestions that the recombinatorial processes that lead to the diverse Ig repertoires in mice are not affected by a short trip to and stay on the ISS. These data do not preclude that differences in the Ig repertoires of ground and flight animals might occur during during active immunization or in younger, possibly more recombinatorily active mice.\nWork Completed to accomplish Specific Aim 2\nCompletion of Antiorthostatic Suspension Experiment\nAn AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during spaceflight (Chapes, Mastro et al. 1993) (Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]; Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we obtained both spleen and liver tissue from those mice.  This protocol was followed so that when mice are flown to ISS in the future, we will have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables.\nUnderstanding the normal, C57BL/6J mouse B-cell repertoire\nIn preparation for the AOS, to understand the normal repertoire of the C57BL/6 mouse we studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presented a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.     Work completed for Specific Aims 1 and 2\nWe completed studies to validate methods to handle tissues from ISS, validate bioinformatics work flow, and the validation using next generation sequencing without amplification.  This work was necessary for the completion of Aims 1 and 2.\nValidation of methods to assess the immunoglobulin gene repertoire in tissues obtained from mice on the International Space Station\nNext Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools were available to assess antibody repertoires.  We could identify immunoglobulin gene-segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. However, due to limitations on the ISS, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed.   Therefore, some of our work had to validate that we could obtain usable biological material to complete our analyses.  To this end, our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. We also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Ig (kappa) variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq (data from RR1 mice from GeneLab) and MiSeq datasets, which we generated ourselves, and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and we produced a data set that provided other data mining options. We validated our workflow by comparing our normal mouse MiSeq data to existing murine antibody repertoire studies validating it for future antibody repertoire studies.\nCharacterization of the naive murine antibody repertoire using unamplified high-throughput sequencing\nSequencing of the antibody repertoire has steadily become cheaper and easier for researchers. These sequencing methods rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. In an effort to eliminate potential biases and create data sets that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs. total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission.  We determined that the use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase or primer usage had no statistical effects on read count.  Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. We also determined that although the unique CR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, it detected most of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.\nReferences\nErickson, L. D., L.-L.

            "task_description": "For most organisms the stresses associated with spaceflight induce a variety of detrimental effects. To foster a safe and productive long-term human presence in space, therapies and countermeasures to spaceflight-induced stress should be developed. Tardigrades (water bears) are polyextremophiles that have evolved to tolerate multiple extreme environments, which are restrictive to most life. In 2007 tardigrades were shown to survive and reproduce normally during an 11-day low Earth orbit on the Foton-M3 Capsule. We speculate that mechanisms tardigrades have evolved to withstand extreme environments on Earth may, as a side-effect, confer protection against the stresses of spaceflight. This makes tardigrades a uniquely valuable system for studying responses to spaceflight. We have sequenced the genome of the tardigrades Hypsibius dujardini, as well as developed and validated experimental and computational approaches for measuring the effect of different environmental conditions on tardigrade gene expression – allowing us to identify mechanisms used by tardigrades to protect themselves from different stresses. We have also developed a reverse genetic approach, RNA interference, for tardigrades that allows us to directly investigate the role of a gene in conferring tolerance to an environment. We will use these approaches to study tardigrades’ initial, as well as multigenerational, response to spaceflight and use RNA interference to test the functionality of the genes identified in our study. Next-generation transcriptome sequencing will be conducted on tardigrades cultures kept 0 generations (founding generation) and 4 generations onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Differential expression analysis will be conducted to compare ISS spaceflight timepoints, ground controls, and tardigrades exposed to other extreme stresses (e.g., desiccation, freezing). This approach will allow us to identify potential mediators of stress tolerance, which will serve as candidates for functional RNA interference experiments. Understanding how tardigrades tolerate spaceflight will better guide future research into countermeasures and therapies for humans exposed to the stresses of prolonged space travel. This proposal's strengths are: the use of an organism that is suited to studying mechanisms of multigenerational tolerance of extreme environments and that has an established RNA interference method for confirming the function of genes identified in our study, our Preliminary Results that validate our proposed approach and technical capabilities as well as the uniqueness and suitability of tardigrades that will allow us to conduct this study. The participants for this study are comprised of experts in tardigrades' stress response and have considerable experience with next-generation sequencing and analysis of non-model organisms. The proposed experiments directly address recommendation AH16 of the Decadal Survey and are in line with recommendation OCB-5 and CMM-5 of NASA’s Multigenerational and Developmental Biology of Invertebrates Research Emphasis as well as NASA’s Fundamental Space Biology Plan 2010-2020 goals. Completion of our proposal will identify genes required for tardigrades to survive multigenerational spaceflight and will be a key step towards developing countermeasures and therapies for stresses associated with prolonged human exposure to space environments.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Along with using mechanisms of stress tolerance to counteract detrimental effects of space travel, data from our proposed experiments could be used in the long term toward solving serious problems in the field of human health. Utilizing mechanisms that allow tardigrades to stabilize their cellular proteins and nucleic acids has been proposed as an option for the dry storage and stabilization of vaccines and other biomaterials (Guo et al., 2000; Wolkers et al., 2001; Puhlev et al., 2001). Because current techniques for vaccine production, distribution, and storage nearly always require a constant cold chain (e.g., -80 and 20 degrees C freezers), these processes are extremely expensive. Some estimates put cold chain costs at around 80% of the total cost of vaccination (Chen et al., 2011). By generating additional stress response datasets, such as response to microgravity, freezing, irradiation, and hypoxia, we will increase our ability and that of other researchers to identify specific mediators of desiccation tolerance, which will then be applied to this and similar problems.\nAdditionally, a better understanding of mechanisms of stress tolerance could lead to the development of drought and/or freeze tolerant crops.\nGuo, N., Puhlev, I., Brown, D.

            "task_progress": "REPORTING  FROM AUGUST 2019; PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR MOVED TO UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING IN FALL 2019 and NEW GRANT 80NSSC20K0283 AWARDED (Ed., 7/24/2020)\nThe bulk of our research on NASA Grant NNX15AB44G that was conducted at UNC (the University of North Carolina) can be broken down into two categories: 1.) ground controls and experiments, and 2.) testing and validation for our flight experiment. Below are summaries of our research in both of these categories.  Ground Controls and Experiments\nIdentification and functional assays to identify mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance: To prepare for comparison of changes in gene expression manifested by tardigrades (water bears) exposed to multigenerational spaceflight with ground-based stresses we have begun gathering transcriptomic datasets from terrestrial stresses. In addition we have performed functional experiments to assess which candidate genes from our transcriptomic datasets are functional mediators of desiccation (drying) tolerance.\nOur major findings from these endeavors have been published in Boothby et al., 2017 (Boothby TC, Pielak GJ. Intrinsically disordered proteins and desiccation tolerance: Elucidating functional and mechanistic underpinnings of anhydrobiosis. Bioessays. 2017 Nov;39(11):700119. Epub 2017 Sep 13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201700119\n; PubMed\nPMID: 28901557\n; Ed. Note 9/9/19: reported in August 2018 FY2018 Task Book report Bibliography ). These results will be summarized here briefly since detailed descriptions of the experiments, methods, and results are presented in publication.\nTo identify genes that might play a role in tardigrade desiccation tolerance, we extracted and sequenced RNA from tardigrades that had either been left unstressed in culture or desiccated. Comparison of transcript levels coming from each predicted gene was conducted and genes ranked based on fold change (how much expression of the gene increased during drying) and overall abundance (how many transcripts per million transcripts were coming from a particular gene).\nThe main takeaway from this comparison was that a class of tardigrade specific genes known as Cytosolic Abundant Heat Soluble (CAHS) genes are upregulated heavily during desiccation. We performed RNA interference experiments in tardigrades to reduce the level of expression of these genes and found that the animals no longer robustly survived drying when CAHS genes were targeted. We also found that expressing these genes in bacteria and yeast (which normally do not have these genes) led to up to two orders of magnitude increases (100X) in desiccation tolerance. Amazingly, when purified CAHS proteins were found to protect biological material (the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase) about an order of magnitude (10X) better than current FDA approved excipient trehalose and serum albumin.\nFinally, we correlate the protective capabilities of these CAHS proteins to their ability to form vitrified (glass-like) solids, as opposed to crystalline solids. These finding may be of interest to NASA, as this presents an avenue for stabilizing and protecting biological material in a dry state without refrigeration. This might be useful for prolonged storage of biomaterials on the ISS or other spaceflight missions where freezer and refrigeration space is limited or logistically difficult.\nExploring cross-tolerance between desiccation and freeze tolerances in tardigrades:\nTardigrades survive an amazing number of abiotic stresses, and in some cases the severity of these stresses is well beyond that tardigrades would ever experience in nature (e.g., temperatures close to absolute zero, thousands of gray of radiation, the vacuum of outer space). The question therefore arises--how did tardigrades evolve tolerance to stresses they have never experienced? One hypothesis is that as tardigrades moved onto land from the ocean (where they originally evolved) they developed desiccation tolerance in response to their new, dryer, conditions and as a by-product became tolerant to other stresses. If this hypothesis is correct, then the mediators that tardigrades use to survive desiccation should in theory be the same mediators they use to survive other stresses. To assess if this is true we performed transcriptome sequencing on tardigrades that had been frozen, and compared this data to our previous datasets (desiccated and unstressed).\nSurprisingly, we found that changes in gene expression between desiccated and frozen tardigrades are highly divergent. In fact, either stress condition is more similar to unstressed conditions than they are to each other. Most telling, we observed that expression of CAHS genes was not influenced by freezing conditions, and furthermore RNA interference targeting these genes did not result in statistical decreases in survival in tardigrades exposed to freezing conditions.\nThese results are presented in detail in Boothby et al., 2017 (Boothby TC, Pielak GJ. Intrinsically disordered proteins and desiccation tolerance: Elucidating functional and mechanistic underpinnings of anhydrobiosis. Bioessays. 2017 Nov;39(11):700119. Epub 2017 Sep 13.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201700119\n; PubMed\nPMID: 28901557\n; Ed. Note 9/9/19: reported in August 2018 FY2018 Task Book report Bibliography ).\nWe are now delving more into our frozen transcriptome to identify functional mediators of freeze tolerance in tardigrades using a similar approach to the one taken for our desiccation study.\nUnderstanding to commonalities and differences between how tardigrades survive freezing and desiccation is an important facet of our overall strategy for this project, as spaceflight induced changes in gene response will ultimately be compared to ground-based stress responses. Comparing changes in gene expression for ground-based stresses now will help us understand the overlap with spaceflight induced changes later.\nHow do tardigrade CAHS proteins mediate desiccation tolerance?\nTo better understand of CAHS proteins protect tardigrades and other biological material and cells from the harmful effects of drying, and how these proteins might protect biological materials from other stresses (included spaceflight), we have been characterizing the biochemical and biophysical nature of these proteins.\nWe have discovered that these proteins behave in a very peculiar way. At room temperature and at concentrations greater than or equal to 30 g/L these proteins form reversible hydrogels. We have characterized the gel state of these proteins via cone plate rheometry as well as scanning electron microscopy. Both techniques clearly demonstrate that these proteins have classic gel-like behavior and morphology. In retrospect it makes sense that these proteins form hydrogels, as hydrogels are known to form vitrified solids when dried (see above).\nWe were curious if the gel state of these proteins is important for their protective capabilities. To probe this, we used 19-F NMR to look at the folded state of a test protein, SH3. SH3 is a ‘metastable’ protein, meaning that normally (in solution) SH3 is in a folded state ~50% of the time and in an unfolded state about ~50% of the time. This is easily measured using 19-F NMR. We first tested SH3 in solution, and as expected two clear peaks (folded and unfolded) were present. We then co-incubated SH3 with a CAHS protein (at increasing concentrations) and looked at the levels of folded and unfolded protein. We found that CAHS proteins had no noticeable effect on SH3 folding below 30 g/L. However, above 30 g/L of CAHS protein, there was a reduction in the level of unfolded SH3 protein, and a corresponding increase in folded SH3. Interestingly, 30 g/L is the concentration determined by cone plate rheometer as the gel point for these proteins. The hydrogels that CAHS proteins form are reverse and heat dependent. Therefore, we tested whether heating to induce the breakdown of the hydrogel influenced SH3 folding. We found when heated from 19C to 42C the CAHS proteins went back into solution (the gel state vanished) and there was a return of an SH3 unfolded population. Cooling this solution back down to 19C resulted in re-gelling of the CAHS proteins and a corresponding disappearance of the SH3 unfolded species and an increase in the SH3 folded species. Therefore, it appears that there is a strong correlation between the gelled state of CAHS proteins and their ability to stabilize proteins in a folded state.\nWe are now characterizing the sequence features of CAHS proteins at allow them to form gels. These studies are being conducted by making mutant versions of the proteins and testing their ability to form gels and protect biological materials.\nTesting and Validation for Flight Experiment\nThe bulk of this effort has been made in preparing for and performing our Science Validation Test (SVT-1).\nThe main goal of SVT-1 was to compare the efficacy of culturing tardigrades (Hypsibius exemplasris) using the CellMax and PI Start Kit (PISK).\nSyringes containing ~500 tardigrades or concentrated algae were prepared using the same stock cultures. Syringes were frozen at -80 degrees Celsius and either stored at this temperature or shipped on dry ice to NASA Ames.\nOn May 10th, tardigrades were injected into 3 PISK bioreactors (at NASA Ames) and 3 CellMax Bioreactors (at UNC).\nTemperature control for PISK bioreactors was carried out using integrated temperature control – which varied between ~15 – 17 degrees Celsius. Oxygenation for PISK bioreactors was carried out via gas dosing using medical grade air.\nTemperature control for CellMax bioreactors was carried out by placing the CellMax system in a controlled temperature chamber. The initial temperature used was 15 degrees Celsius, but was changed to 16 degrees Celsius to more closely mirror PISK temperatures. Oxygenation was not controlled, but rather relied on the passive transport of oxygen across the CellMax systems permeable tubing.\nEvery 7 days, up to day 21, subsamples (300 ul) were extracted from both PISK and CellMax bioreactors using syringes. These samples were stored at -80 degrees Celsius. At day 14, fresh algae (food source) was injected into each PISK and CellMax bioreactor. At day 28, the experiment ended and whole bioreactors were detached and frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. PISK subsample syringes and bioreactors were returned frozen on dry ice to the Principal Investigator's (PI) lab at UNC.\nUpon receipt at the PI’s lab, samples were transferred from their shipping unit to a -80 degree freezer.\nTo compare the viability of culturing using the PISK, all samples were thawed. For each subsample (300 ul) the entire volume of thawed sample was analyzed by direct observation using a dissecting microscope. Total animal counts were taken and densities calculated. Similarly, for bioreactors, the entire contents of the bioreactor was thawed and transferred to a 15 mL tube. Three 50 ul samples were taken from each tube and total animal counts made and densities calculated.\nThe remaining bioreactor contents was fixed with RNAlater and processed for total RNA extraction.\nTardigrade Densities and Total Counts\nPrior to testing our definition for success was achieving Day 28 animal densities in the PISK bioreactors that were above or within 20% of the densities from our CellMax bioreactors. Our average PISK animal density at Day 28 was 357.8 animals/mL where as our CellMax Day 28 animal density was slightly lower at 282.2 animals/mL. By our original definition, the PISK successfully competed with the CellMax system with regards to effectively culturing tardigrades over a 28 day period.\nREPORTING IN AUGUST 2018\nWe have been preparing for our flight experiment. This has mostly manifested itself in the development of an SRD (Science Requirements Document), protocols, and coordinating with the engineering team who are doing some final tests on our bioreactor setup. Our next step will be to actually get our animals in the hardware and do ground tests.",

            "task_description": "Beneficial microbes play a significant role in the normal development of animal tissues. Through the formation of healthy stable associations between host and symbiont, particularly during post-embryonic development, carefully regulated developmental pathways can be induced.\nIn this experimental research plan, we propose to examine the impact of microgravity on the normal molecular interactions between host and symbiont. To examine these effects we propose to use the model system between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. For over two decades this squid-vibrio model has served as an ideal ecosystem to examine the influences of mutualistic bacteria on animal development. To simulate microgravity, rotating bioreactors called high-aspect-ratio rotating wall vessel bioreactors (HARVs) will be used to provide a low-shear environment for both the host and symbiont, thereby simulating microgravity. Specifically, we propose the following:\nObjective 1. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.\nObjective 2. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria exposure under microgravity conditions.\nObjective 3. Develop a flight-ready microtiter plate for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis in this new hardware.\nThe proposed work has several implications for the field of space biology. First, by examining how normal healthy symbioses are initiated and maintained under microgravity conditions, we can begin to determine the sensitivity of these ecosystems to perturbations in the space environment. Secondly, we can assess the genetic and metabolic responses to gravity in the presence and absence of symbiosis, potentially identifying previously unknown triggers or cues associated with post-embryonic animal development.",

These ubiquitous interactions are essential for the normal development and health of the host organism. This project helps to improve our understanding of the molecular cross-talk that occurs between animals and microbes by delineating those genes and pathways that are influenced by gravity. As the force of gravity has not changed throughout Earth’s history we have a unique opportunity to assess how these host-microbe interactions alter gene expression and their physiology in the absence of gravity."

            "task_progress": "A. Project Overview – This project examined the impact of microgravity on commensal, non-pathogenic microbes that associate with animal tissues. To address this issue we conducted an integrative study in which the responses of both animal host and microbe were examined in situ under simulated microgravity conditions. The long-term goal of the research was to assess whether those interactions between animal cells and mutualistic bacteria undergo a significant alteration in cell-cell communication, immune response, and physiology under microgravity conditions. The overall objective of this proposal was to examine the genomic expression patterns of a host symbiotic squid Euprymna scolopes in response to the luminescent bacterial symbiont, Vibrio fischeri. The results of this study helped identify those genetic pathways that are differentially regulated in the host animal in the presence and absence of mutualistic bacteria under simulated microgravity conditions, thereby improving our understanding of human health in the space environment.\nB. Major Findings and Outcomes of Research\n1. The symbiotic V. fischeri appear to modulate the host innate immune and oxidative stress response of the host light organ during modeled microgravity conditions. Using RNA-seq we analyzed the transcriptome of the host light organ (i.e., the site of symbiosis) of the squid in the presence (symbiotic) and absence (aposymbiotic) of beneficial V. fischeri under simulated microgravity conditions. At 12 h post inoculation both the symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with hemocyanin, oxidative stress, and the innate immune system. However, by 24 h post inoculation only the aposymbiotic animals exhibited an upregulated stress response, whereas those animals exposed to V. fischeri no longer showed the stress response suggesting that V. fischeri is helping to modulate the host response. Results were published in Casaburi et al., 2017 – See cumulative bibliography for citation; reported in FY2018 report.\n2. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shedding by V. fischeri is increased under simulated microgravity conditions. Under modeled microgravity conditions V. fischeri releases a statistically higher amount of the virulence factor LPS, known to cause apoptosis and inflammation in both mutualistic and pathogenic microbes. The LPS production is primarily associated with flagellar movement and by knocking out flagellar production and motion the amount of LPS produced under both microgravity and gravity conditions was reduced. However, even with the removal of the flagella, the LPS shedding was still statistically higher in modeled microgravity conditions compared to gravity conditions. We have ascertained that under modeled microgravity the V. fischeri membrane integrity is compromised and is more susceptible to antibiotic treatment. We are examining whether we can further inhibit the differential shedding of LPS under modeled microgravity conditions.\n3. Sequencing and closure of the Euprymna scolopes genome revealed two evolutionary mechanisms for symbiotic organ evolution.  Using the RNA-seq data generated during this project we generated a reference transcriptome for the host animal and use that as a scaffold to close the genome of E. scolopes. Although this task was not originally part of our project goals the data was invaluable in providing a closed genome for the squid-vibrio research community. Analysis of the genome and reference transcriptome revealed that there are two distinctive evolutionary processes associated with the origin of symbiotic organs in animals. A manuscript is currently in press at PNAS.\n4. Modeled microgravity alters the innate immune pathway of host squid. Using the new technique NanoString, we complemented the previously generated transcriptomes by analyzing the differential gene expression along additional time points (0, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24 h) and have generated a new model of the receptor and signal cascade of the innate immune system. We have also determined that modeled microgravity impacts the expression of the innate immune genes and we have identified key parts of the pathway that are being disrupted. (Publication in preparation.)\n5. Modeled microgravity does not significantly alter the transcriptome of the symbiont V. fischeri; however, the global regulatory gene hfq is critical to regulate the bacterial stress responses in low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). The transcriptome of the bacterial symbiont was examined during both exponential and stationary phase growth and results indicated that modeled microgravity had no significant impact on gene expression at 12 and 24 h. However, when the global regulator gene hfq was deleted from the bacteria, there was a pronounced change in gene expression under LSMMG conditions. There was a dramatic increase in the number of transcripts associated with TCA cycling and stress responses suggesting that the Hfq protein serves as a critical regulator for the bacteria under modeled microgravity conditions.

Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. As a result of supplemental funding, we are now able to gather genetic data on the mechanisms by which mixed bacterial species are able to form biofilms in microgravity conditions. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "September 2023 Update: Our spaceflight experiment launched on SpaceX CRS-21 (SpX-21) on December 6, 2020 and two of our three samples returned on January 14, 2021. The third sample returned with Crew-1 on May 2, 2021. We encountered two major issues that have led us to request a reflight (which has been approved). One issue was media contamination, rendering our data interpretation as inconclusive. A second issue (needlestick injury to a space crewmember) resulted in some of our samples incubating for 117 days on the International Space Station (ISS) rather than the planned 4 days. While that caused a potential loss of some transcriptome data (described in the Task Progress section), a really positive development from the extended incubation resulted in enhanced microbial corrosion data, as well as the return of viable microorganisms that can now be investigated for genetic changes as a consequence of prolonged spaceflight. We are now pursuing an active study of experimental evolution in collaboration with the microbiology lab at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) (Co-I Mark Ott, Sarah Wallace, and their team). Another major positive development is the initiative to develop a machine learning computational approach to identify microbial-induced corrosion (MIC). MIC represents an estimated annual global economic loss of $500B and detection is a key need. We anticipate that our analytical approach in this area will have major economic benefits, far beyond the space program. Once our reflight occurs, we will be able to complete all of our original objectives easily within a year of getting our samples."

            "task_progress": "Our overall objectives for this proposal are to study surface-adherent bacterial growth (biofilm formation) on stainless steel materials used for the water recovery system on the International Space Station, with a mixed bacterial population and its potential contributions to stainless steel corrosion during spaceflight, and compare these effects to those seen on Earth-based studies (ground controls). Included in these studies were tests to investigate the role of a potential silver-based disinfectant in controlling biofilm formation and associated corrosion. At the outset, we proposed to study biofilms using light and electron microscopy during spaceflight as well as with identical experiments on Earth (ground controls). We have since expanded these techniques, and more importantly, the rigor of the microscopy investigations by developing a computer analysis approach for quantitative analysis of the light microscopy results.\nDuring the current year (2022-2023), we began the process of developing an artificial intelligence-based approach to measure microbial corrosion using electron microscopy. We also obtained approval from NASA to include analysis of genetic activity (officially termed transcriptome analysis) so that we would be able to determine the activities of the microorganisms during spaceflight and ground experiments in the presence and absence of silver disinfectants. Our initial flight experiment launched on SpaceX CRS-21 in December 2020, and most of our samples were returned in mid-January 2021. A later set of samples, containing living bacteria, returned in May 2021. Just prior to the December 2020 launch, we learned that one of the commercially-supplied ingredients of our bacterial growth media was contaminated, so while we obtained results from the initial experiments, we were unable to determine whether any effects were due to the spaceflight conditions or due to the contamination. As a result, we have been approved for a reflight, which is currently scheduled for March 2024. The goal of the reflight will be to conduct and analyze our original experiments related to biofilm growth, potential control by silver disinfection, and its role in microbial corrosion of stainless steel. One unexpected positive opportunity arose from our delayed sample (returned in May 2021) as we were able to culture living bacteria, that had been incubated in orbit for 117 days. We also have ground control bacteria that incubated for the same duration, and with the assistance of the microbiology team at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), we are able to sequence these organisms, as well as the original “ancestral bacteria” (cultures preserved prior to experimentation) and see whether spaceflight induces any unique mutations in these organisms, a scientific approach referred to as experimental evolution. These two studies (experimental evolution and developing artificial intelligence to diagnose microbial corrosion) have been our most active areas of research during the 2022-23 period.\nIn summary, while the original contamination event and reflight scheduling has been quite challenging, we have obtained some unexpected bonus science in computer-aided image analysis of biofilms and corrosion, as well as an unexpected and highly meaningful opportunity to investigate whether spaceflight affects bacterial evolution. With a future successful reflight, we anticipate a highly successful scientific outcome.",

            "task_description": "One of the main concerns for long-term deep manned space missions are health risks associated with altered gravitational environment and prolonged exposure to low-dose radiation above levels normally found on Earth. Microgravity and radiation exposure have been known to produce a number of neurological disturbances and neurodegeneration by space flight condition. However, the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the brain vasculature and the underlying mechanism(s) of these disturbances are less studied and remain unclear.\nOur proposal seeks to fill in the gap by testing the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase is a critical source of the neurovascular oxidative stress following space flight conditions that mediates vascular remodeling in the brain, thus disrupting communication between endothelial cells and astrocytes and altering production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. It is further proposed that these changes will contribute to increased vascular permeability and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disturbance, thus resulting in neurological deficit.\nOur specific aims are 1) Define the causal relationships between space flight condition induced NADPH oxidase expression, vascular damage, and BBB function following microgravity and/or low-dose irradiation in mature mice using neuropathology, stereological, and automated image analysis, and neurobehavioral outcomes. 2) Determine if space flight condition-induced oxidative stress is mediated through NADPH oxidase in brain microvasculature.\nNox2 (a subunit of NADPH oxidase) gene knockout (Nox2(-/-)) mice, and  wild-type (Nox2(+/+))  C57BL/6 mice  will be used in this ground-based animal study. Hindlimb unloading (HLU) will be used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component.  Low-dose/low-dose-rate (LDR) gamma-irradiation (0.5 Gy at 0.01 cGy/h) will be delivered to the whole-body of mature adult mice to simulate the radiation component for over 21 days while the animals are tail-unloaded in cages for microgravity simulation.  We will evaluate the radiation- and microgravity-induced brain vascular and tissue remodeling at multiple time points (1 day to 12 months post-irradiation).\nTogether, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced imaging techniques, stereological analysis, and behavioral tests will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of space flight condition-induced oxidative damage on brain tissue and vascular remodeling. Understanding how factors and environmental stress impact on vasculature, tissue remodeling, and function will increase our knowledge and focus toward more effective countermeasures during human space flight and planetary exploration. Our study will also lend new insights into the causes and possible treatments of debilitating neurovascular-related disease and neurodegeneration by targeting NADPH oxidase activation.",

Our study will provide the first detailed description of combined effects of microgravity and LDR radiation on oxidative stress-induced brain tissue and microvessel network remodeling and underlying mechanism(s) of potential interaction of space flight environmental components over a 12-month observation period. Our research will provide important input to elucidate cellular pathways of response and adaptation to stress imposed by environmental conditions in the brain vasculature.

So far, we have finished four batches of wild-type (WT) animal studies for specific aim 1, at 7 days, 1, 3, and 9 month time points and Nox2 knockout mice study as proposed in specific aims 1 and 2.  We have examined protein markers associated with the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis in the brain using immunostaining, metabolic response using metabolic biochemical assays, hematological parameters, and behavioral responses after combined exposure to simulated microgravity and low-dose radiation. Our data provide the first evidence that prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity and LDR radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress biomarkers which may increase the likelihood of brain injury and reduced antioxidant defense. NOX2-containing nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH oxidase) may contribute to spaceflight environment-induced oxidative stress. These results suggest that microgravity may lead to changes in exploratory/risk-taking behaviors in the absence of other sensorimotor or cognitive deficits and that combined microgravity and a chronic, low dose of gamma radiation may lead to blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These results have been published in four peer reviewed journals: Radiation Research, Nature npj Microgravity, PLOS One.\nWe have received supplement funding in October, 2017 to use\"omics\"-based molecular phenotyping approach for identification and characterization of genomic signatures in eye and brain associated with low-dose radiation and simulated microgravity at 1-and 4- month time points.

Wild-type (WT, Nox2 (+/+)) C57BL/6 mice or Nox2 (-/-) (B6. 129S6-CYBBM) knockout (KO) mice were placed into one of the following groups: age-matched control, hindlimb unloading (HLU), low-dose/low-dose-rate radiation (LDR), or HLU+LDR simultaneously for 21 days, and were then sacrificed 1 month later. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of microgravity. The LDR was delivered using 57Co plates (0.04Gy at 0.01cGy/h) to the whole body in order to simulate the radiation experienced while in space.  Brains were isolated for characterization of various oxidative stress markers and vascular topology.\nWe received supplement funding in October, 2017 to use  “omics”-based molecular phenotyping approach for identification and characterization of genomic signatures in eye and brain associated with low-dose radiation and simulated microgravity  at 1- and 4– month time points. Omics analyses performed were\n•\t RNAseq for full genome transcriptomics including RNA-Seq HT Ribo-depletion library preps and RNA spike-control.\n•\tDNA methylation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS).\nThe assay has completed and dataset are in the process of submitting to NASA GeneLab site, through NASA IT system. Many canonical pathways were significantly activated/inhibited in the brain after HLU, LDgammaR, or the combination of both. Most robust changes are observed in LDgammaR + HLU group compared to control. At 1 months, the combination group induced significant activations of EIF2 phosphorylation signaling pathway in the brain, responsible for chronic neurodegeneration. Cellular immune response pathways including leukocyte extravasation signaling, as well as pathways responsible for cell growth, cell repair, and metabolic stress were also significantly altered compared to controls.  The mRNA expression for many genes regulating oxidative stress (e.g., GNRH1, UCN3), extracellular matrix remodeling (e.g., Cldn3, FBLN1), endothelial cell biology (e.g., AQP1), and cognitive function (e.g., OXT, AVP) were significantly changed (p<0.05) after HLU+ LDgammaR compared to control.  Gene analysis  of retina tissues also showed that many key pathways responsible for photoreceptor function, oxidative stress, and metabolic function were significantly different between LDgammaR + HLU and control (p<0.05).",

The research in this GeneLab Innovation study has therefore sought to continue and extend our current analysis of the GeneLab plant science data through bioinformatics, experimental tests of predictions, and development of approaches to facilitate data exploration and rapid sharing of analytical tools. This work directly addresses Goal 1 of the Space Biology program by creating ‘new knowledge of how biological systems adapt to space.’ In addition, this research approaches some of GeneLab’s guiding questions as to how implementation of large scale dataset analyses can help produce new insights and hypotheses about the effects of spaceflight on biological systems.\nAim (1): We have been using informatics to ask how spaceflight alters the plant transcriptome and proteome using GeneLab data. We have then compared these changes to responses to other stresses and environments, (e.g., pathogen attack or oxidative stress) where large-scale, publicly available datasets have already been deposited outside of GeneLab. These datasets include responses to partial gravity and gravitropism-related transcriptomes. For example, our analysis of Arabidopsis data from the BRIC (Biological Research in Canisters), EMCS (European Modular Cultivation System), and APEX (Advanced Plant Experiment) experiments has revealed oxidative stress and hypoxia as major flight-related stresses and has targeted gene families ranging from heat-shock proteins to cell wall peroxidases as likely key players in this spaceflight response network. The more comprehensive analysis possible with the bioinformatic tools generated in this innovation study have greatly expanded the range of molecular mechanisms we can detect.\nAim (2): The second element of the work has been to take the genes defined from the bioinformatics in Aim 1 and test their function by using mutants in these genes and assessing their responses to a suite of phenotypic assays including: morphometric measurements of gravtiropic and clinostat growth in short and long-term hypoxia and flooding and mechanical stimulation. Inferences from these growth analyses have been compared to those revealed by quantitative PCR results of marker genes identified from the core spaceflight, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and gravitropism transcriptomic analyses.\nAim (3): GeneLab datasets also offer the opportunity to address the key challenge of facilitating exploration of these large, complex, and specialized datasets by non-specialists. We have developed a database/exploration environment, the TOAST (Test Of All Space Transcriptomes) database, aimed at increasing such accessibility for the non-specialist. This system uses the Qlik database management software and offers a highly interactive data visualization toolset that allows non-expert users to search across, and explore interconnections within, large and complex datasets.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is leading to benefits outside of the spaceflight arena at two levels: (1) tool development and (2) extension of basic knowledge of plant stress responses.\nAt the level of tool development, we have generated a large dataset exploration environment built around the Qlik data visualization toolset. This tool allows rapid comparison and exploration between large-scale ‘omics-level datasets, facilitating comparison between transcriptomics/gene expression data and then cross-comparisons to protein-level data such as proteomics analyses. Although focused on spaceflight data within GeneLab’s data repository, this architecture is applicable to wider experimental datasets. In parallel we have also been developing gas regulation chambers to allow analysis of plant growth and molecular phenotypes related to lowered oxygen availability. Although again focused on spaceflight-related events of lowered oxygen levels, these devices are also applicable to studying the effects of ground-based phenomena such as flooding effects on plant biology.\nOur analyses of phenotypes has also extended basic understanding on plant responses to touch, low oxygen levels, and oxidative stress signaling on Earth. For example, we have been able to define an array of genes that when mutated alter responses to oxidative stress on Earth. Oxidative stress is a major element of stress signaling and resistance pathways and so this basic understanding is expanding our broad knowledge of how plants are able to respond to less than optimal environmental conditions."

            "task_progress": "Bioinformatics tool development:\nWe have developed, and now deployed, a database and exploration environment for mining the publicly available spaceflight plant biology data called the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptomes, or TOAST, database. This system is built around the Qlik data visualization software. Thus, we have imported all the GeneLab plant biology data alongside publicly available datasets from US, European, and Chinese researchers into the TOAST database. We have also imported publicly available datasets related to spaceflight-associated stresses including: oxidative stress, responses to growth on the clinostat or during magnetic levitation, and radiation exposure, to help make comparisons to the spaceflight datasets. We have applied a minimal requirement of 3 independent biological replicates for each study allowing for the calculation of statistical significance of any changes seen (P- and Q-values). This has meant the database covers a wide range of studies on Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.\nThe database was tested in a public beta-test over 2018-2019 leading to improvements in the user interface, increases in the stability and improvements in the sets of analytical tools available. The database is now in version 4.6 and is publicly available at\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast\n. Alongside the database an online tutorial has been developed (\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata\n) to aid users in getting started with the system. A manuscript describing the use of the database has also been published in Frontiers in Plant Science.\nAlongside the TOAST database, a Meta data app has also been deployed to allow a deeper analysis of the available plant spaceflight data. Thus, the meta data associated with each dataset within the TOAST database has been manually curated and imported into an allied Qlik-based database. This approach allows searching of the linked experimental elements such as growth hardware, type of spaceflight, and lighting system used to allow the user to ask which experiments share similar conditions, or to try to understand how the experiments they are analyzing are different. The metadata app is publicly available at:\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata\n.\nMutant analyses:\nAn additional goal for this work has been to use phenotyping of mutants in the genes identified as showing strong links to spaceflight-related events from the TOAST-based analysis described above. This phenotyping is being used to ask how well TOAST generates reliable and testable hypotheses about plant responses to spaceflight. Gravitropism, reaction to hypoxia, and response to oxidative stress are all closely linked to spaceflight-related conditions due to spaceflight’s disruption in normal plant gravity signaling, reduced availability of oxygen from the lack of convective mixing of gasses in space, and high oxidative loads due to a general background of spaceflight-related stress. These responses have therefore been used to screen the mutants for phenotypes. Analysis using the TOAST database has identified a suite of genes related to oxidative stress such as Heat Shock Proteins (chaperones) and the ROS (reactive oxygen species) producing enzymes such as the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, or RBOHs as likely key players in spaceflight stress responses. Phenotyping mutants in these genes has revealed unexpected linkages to spaceflight-related stresses, such as a role for heat shock proteins in gravitropism and the RBOHs in a broad suite of spaceflight effects from flooding to mechanical responses.\nTOAST as an educational tool:\nIn addition to a research discovery tool, the TOAST database has also been tested in the educational setting. For example, TOAST has been used in the classroom in Verona and Oregon High Schools in WI, where students went through the process of data analysis, gene discovery, and hypothesis generation. In addition, TOAST has been incorporated into an undergraduate class experience at Carthage College, a 4 year liberal arts college in WI. In collaboration with Dr. Andrea Henle, TOAST analyses were incorporated into her Astrobiology undergraduate class with the goal of leading the students through an authentic research experience, discovering new genes related to spaceflight response in Arabidopsis and then testing these hypotheses with gravitropism assays on mutants in the selected genes.\nAt UWisconsin-Madison, the Principal Investigator (PI) also maintains a “Collaboratory” where biology and engineering undergraduates and high school students come together to develop plant phenotyping equipment and other hardware relevant to our spaceflight-related work. There are generally 10-15 students working on various plant molecular and engineering projects related to space biology and GeneLab with a practical lab course called AstroBotanical Engineering being offered ~each semester. These students have been helping develop the TOAST database interface, using TOAST to analyze spaceflight and related plant datasets, and working on the phenotyping pipelines to test the predictions made through using the GeneLab analyses from the TOAST database.",

            "task_description": "Microbial cells exposed to the human spaceflight environment are observed to respond differently to similarly-treated ground controls, a phenomenon dubbed the “spaceflight syndrome.” Over the past 4 decades, a number of experiments have been conducted inside various vehicles (e.g., Shuttle, Mir, ISS (International Space Station)) to understand how microbes sense and respond to stresses of human spaceflight including, but not limited to, microgravity and ionizing radiation. In early studies, various phenotypic outputs were measured, such as: growth rate and yield; virulence; biofilm formation and architecture; and resistance to antibiotics or abiotic stresses. With the advent of the genomics and post-genomics revolutions in biology, there have been initial efforts to understand more fundamental molecular aspects of the spaceflight syndrome, by performing global-scale \"-omics\" analyses of the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, etc. of microbes exposed to spaceflight. Such studies have yielded valuable insights into the molecular responses of certain individual microbes to the spaceflight environment; furthermore, datasets from these experiments have been deposited into a common, publicly available database, the GeneLab Data System (GDS). We propose to use the data in the GDS as a starting point to explore commonalities and differences in the responses to spaceflight of various different microbes, with an eye towards uncovering possible common fundamental mechanisms.\nWorking Hypothesis: Exposure to the human spaceflight environment alters the physicochemical environment immediately surrounding bacterial cells and within the cells themselves (mainly due to microgravity effects and ionizing radiation). Cells sense the altered conditions and respond using the systems they possess--which evolved on Earth, not in space. A large proportion of microbial physiological responses are regulated at the level of transcription, thus the transcriptome is a logical place to search for common fundamental mechanisms.\nObjectives: In order to address this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims:\n1. Mine the GDS bacterial transcriptome database and reprocess the data in a fashion that will allow cross-organism comparisons.\n2. Search the spaceflight literature to identify additional relevant datasets that may have escaped inclusion in the GDS. Deposit these additional datasets in the GDS. Access and reformat the additional data as in Specific Aim 1.\n3. Perform bioinformatics analyses to identify pathways and regulons significantly activated or repressed by exposure to spaceflight vs. ground controls in individual organisms.\n4. Compare transcriptomes of the same organism grown in simulated microgravity (clinostats) vs. actual spaceflight conditions.\n5. Perform comparisons across species, genera, families, and higher taxonomic groupings to find similarities and differences in spaceflight responses.\n6. Develop specific hypotheses from the comparisons in Specific Aim 5 and perform wet-lab experiments to test these hypotheses in ground-based systems and in future spaceflight missions.\nExpected significance: Microbes are ubiquitous in space vehicles, as well as on and within humans themselves. Because microbes play such important and essential roles in the health and well-being of astronauts and their life-support systems, it is imperative to understand their responses to the human spaceflight environment. The analyses proposed here will attempt to systematically identify common molecular mechanisms used by a wide range of bacteria to cope with the stresses encountered in human spaceflight, a primary goal of both the GeneLab endeavor and the broader mission of the NASA Space Biology Program. In addition, the pipelines and protocols developed in this study will have applications beyond GeneLab, and in principle can be applied to comparison of the transcriptomic responses of any collection of microbes to any given type of stress.",

We confirmed this for specific up-regulated spaceflight genes (encoding biofilm and biotin biosynthesis) using qRT-PCR. Because Specific Aim 6 depended on a positive result of Specific Aim 5, there was no longer a reason to pursue Specific Aim 6.",

To drive photosynthesis, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have attracted attention because of their efficiency, longevity, small size, safety, and spectral variety. There have been recent interests in analyzing the effects of certain wavelengths on plant growth and phytonutrients in order to optimize crop production and quality aboard the International Space Station (ISS). With intentions to fully employ LEDs for use in space, a comparative study is proposed herein. In this work, short crop cycles of red romaine lettuce will be grown under five light treatments of cool white (CW), CW + blue (B), CW + green (G), CW + red (R), and CW + far red (FR) LEDs. This investigation will characterize and quantify biomass production, morphology, chlorophyll, and the production of key phytonutrients such as lutein, zeaxanthin, potassium, magnesium, iron, and vitamin K. The crop responses to each treatment will be evaluated and used to select an LED combination that would optimize both plant growth and nutrient content.",

The primary crops studied were 'Outredgeous' red romaine lettuce and 'Rubi' red pak choi. Other crops studied but not published include Mizuna Mustard, and Chinese Cabbage. The major findings for lettuce suggest that light recipe can have profound effects on growth and morphology that could be beneficial for astronauts on long duration missions. For instance, light recipes enriched with green light were effective for rigorous growth early on the cycle for lettuce plants up 17 days old. Light recipes with high amounts of blue light resulted in small compact plants with higher nutrients such as potassium and secondary metabolites such as lutein. A recipe with light ratios similar to sunlight was observed to be most effective for increasing overall biomass accumulation. The scientific and technological knowledge obtained from this study benefits space and commercial applications here on Earth. These results have been accepted for publication in the journal, Life Sciences in Space Research.\nThe major findings for red pak choi suggest that cabbage responds much differently than lettuce, and more favorably to narrow spectrum LED light recipes. A recipe containing red and blue only resulted in the largest plants with highest fresh mass, and highest levels of the antioxidant, anthocyanin. Unlike lettuce, green light or broad-spectrum white LEDs inhibited growth in comparison to red and blue light. Ultimately, this subsequent study demonstrated that LEDs, which offer a variety of light wavelength options, are an important capability for astronauts to have when it comes to the precise control over growing various crops. These results have been accepted for publication in the journal, Scientia Horticulturae.",

Plants have multiple sensory systems that respond to mechanical forces that include not only gravity, but also touch, and tension at the cell, tissue, and whole-organism level.  Plant growth in space is affected by all of these – not just gravity directly, but also through the other modalities of mechanical sensing that are indirectly affected by gravity, for example, shoot bending and other changing tissue shapes.  Mechanical stimuli have both short-term effects, such as creation of cellular calcium transients and tissue-wide waves over seconds and minutes, and long-term effects, such as reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and alteration of the subcellular location of proteins such as the auxin efflux carriers, that occur over 2-4 hours. The molecular components of gravitational perception mechanisms and of the short-term and long-term responses of plant cells and tissues to mechanical stimuli of all types are almost entirely unknown.  The objective of the research was to use data from NASA's GeneLab to identify differentially expressed genes that could be responding to the mechanical changes that accompany space flight, and to use these genes to study plant growth responses to the space environment.",

            "task_description": "Approximately 29% of astronauts on short-term (~2 wk) space shuttle flights and 60% on long-duration (~6 mo) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity. These visual disturbances have been hypothesized to be related to increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure. Modeling studies have shown that a compromise in the integrity of the vascular blood-brain barrier (BBB) would serve to elevate ICP. While much attention has been directed toward the role of the cerebral vasculature in elevating ICP, little work has been done to examine conditions of the vasculature in the eye and the potential role of microgravity in altering the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), which maintains a similar function in the eye for regulating intraocular pressure as the BBB in the cranium. One condition known to compromise the BRB is oxidative stress. For example, in diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in Western society, elevations in oxidative stress compromise the BRB and increase vascular permeability in the eye. The proposed studies through the ISS Rodent Tissue Sharing Opportunity will provide new and important information regarding the effects of spaceflight on oxidative stress in the eye and its potential deleterious effects on the BRB.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Through the collection of 300 post-flight questionnaires, it has recently been reported that approximately 29% of astronauts flying short-duration missions and 60% of astronauts on long-duration missions experience an impairment of distance and near visual acuity.  Furthermore, some of these changes remain degraded for years after flight.  It is hard to imagine a more severe, prevalent, and potentially intractable condition threatening human space exploration than the loss of visual acuity.  In 2010, NASA Space Life Sciences at Johnson Space Center in Houston held a Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) Summit of leading clinicians and scientists with expertise in ophthalmology and cerebral fluid dynamics, and it was hypothesized that the visual impairment experienced by astronauts was the result of a microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shifts and corresponding increases in ICP and intraocular pressure. The proposed studies will provide new and important information regarding the effects of spaceflight on oxidative stress in the eye, its potential deleterious effects on the blood-retinal barrier and, consequently, factors that may function to increase intraocular pressure. In addition, understanding the relation between oxidative stress in the eye and disruption of the blood-retinal barrier may provide new insight into other conditions that affect visual acuity, including diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in Western society, where elevations in oxidative stress compromise the blood-retinal barrier and increase vascular permeability in the eye."

            "task_progress": "The goal of Study 1 was to address Specific Aims #1 and #2, i.e., to investigate the effects of spaceflight on oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells and to identify spaceflight-induced changes in protein expression profiles in mouse ocular tissue.  Additionally, we sought to determine whether the application of 1g artificial gravity (AG) during spaceflight could mitigate any detrimental effects of microgravity on the retina.  We hypothesized that spaceflight would induce elevations in oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal endothelial cells, as well as alter ocular proteins associated with apoptosis, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic function.  We further hypothesized that the application of 1g AG would mitigate these changes.\nTwelve male 9-week old C57BL/6 male mice, obtained from a United States (US) breeding colony, were launched July 18, 2016, at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a SpaceX-9 rocket for the 35-day Mouse Habitat Unit-1 (MHU-1) mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) located in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) \"Kibo\" facility on the ISS.  The 12 flight mice were subdivided into two groups.  The first group of flight mice (n=6) were exposed to ambient microgravity conditions (µg group), while the second group of flight mice (n=6) were exposed to continuous artificial Earth gravity (µg + 1g group) while they were in the HCU.  AG was achieved through the use of a short-arm centrifuge for the duration of their stay on the ISS.  The flight mice were then returned live to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on August 26, 2016.  It took approximately 40 hours for the mice to be recovered in the Pacific Ocean, brought to shore and transported to the testing and processing laboratory located in San Diego, California on August 28, 2016.  The spaceflight mice were then sacrificed and their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. Ground control mouse studies were completed in Japan after the return of the flight mice.  Control mice (Habitat Controls, n=6; Vivarium controls, n=6) were acquired on August 31, 2016 from a breeding colony in Japan and shipped to the JAXA animal facility in Tsukuba, Japan.  HC mice were acclimated to the water lixit system and the same special food bar diet as the spaceflown mice were fed.  They were first housed in the Transportation Cage Unit (TCU) to simulate launch and flight to the ISS, and then placed in the HCUs to simulate the housing conditions experienced by µg mice on the ISS. They were again placed in the TCU to simulate the return to Earth flight.  The control mouse dissections took place on November 3, 2016.  Control mouse eye tissue was then shipped to the US for analysis. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water.\nStudy 1 Conclusions:  1)\tThe data demonstrated that spaceflight alone induced apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells, which suggests disruption in the integrity of the blood-retinal barrier.   2)\tThe number of apoptotic cells in the retina was reduced 24% during spaceflight with continuous artificial 1g while the animals were housed on the ISS.   3)\tProteomic analysis showed that many proteins were significantly altered after spaceflight compared to that in habitat control mice; these proteins are involved in cell death, cell repair, inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, and apoptosis.   4)\tContinuous artificial 1g showed lower organismal death and greater cellular organization and function signaling compared to the spaceflight alone group.\nThe purpose of Study 2 was to more directly address Specific Aim #2, i.e., to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the retinal vasculature and possible alterations in blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, and to identify spaceflight-induced proteomic significance and biomarkers in mouse ocular tissue. The data demonstrate that spaceflight induces apoptosis in the retinal vascular endothelial cells and photoreceptors, as well as evokes alterations in vascular levels of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) proteins related to BRB integrity.\nStudy 2 Conclusions:  1.\tThe results of this study demonstrate that exposure to a spaceflight environment is associated with increased retinal endothelial cell and photoreceptor cell death.   2.\tThe changes in retinal microvasculature BRB integrity (i.e., vascular levels of AQP-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1), indicate decrements in barrier function in the eye.   3.\tProtein expression profiles and pathway analysis provide evidence that spaceflight induces changes in cellular organization, cell cycle, mitochondrial function, circadian clock, and oxidative stress in the retina.   4.\tCollectively, these observations are consistent with, and extend, previous findings in rodents exposed to a weightless environment and suggest that spaceflight involves a complex combination of stressors that leads to alterations and impairment of ocular structure and function.\nThe purpose of Study 3 was to address Specific Aim #1, i.e., to characterize the effects of spaceflight on the retinal oxidative stress and extracellular matrix remodeling in the eye. Specifically, this study characterized the physical response of the retina, the degradation of photoreceptors, and the presence of oxidative stress markers. The findings also indicate that spaceflight induces a distinct gene expression signature in the retina of mice. This signature is enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Several genes with significant differential expression in the spaceflight condition are also differentially expressed in the disease retinitis pigmentosa.\nStudy 3 Conclusions:  The results suggest that the differential expression induced by spaceflight may be pathological. Additionally, we suspect the changes observed during spaceflight are influenced by alternative splicing and chromatin reorganization.\nThe purpose of Study 4 was to determine the effects of spaceflight on possible alterations in DNA methylome and transcriptome of the retina, and to determine whether the primary impacted genes belong to physiologically relevant cellular processes and pathways. These include processes and pathways associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial function, tissue remodeling, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. This study represents a more sophisticated experimental approach than that originally proposed in the specific aims and, consequently, provides more information regarding the broad effects of spaceflight on the retina.\nFemale C57 BL/6J mice that were 16 weeks old were used in this study.  Both spaceflight and ground control animals were housed in NASA’s animal enclosure modules (AEM), with control mice being exposed to the same environment conditions (12-hour light cycle, temperature and humidity) as those flown on the ISS. Control animals were kept inside an environmental simulator (ISSES) at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center, and the spaceflight animals were transported to the ISS by SpaceX4 on September 21, 2014. All animals were fed with a special NASA food bar diet and their health was checked daily. The spaceflight mice were sacrificed and frozen in orbit after 37 days of flight, while ground control mice were simultaneously sacrificed and frozen under identical conditions. After the frozen carcasses were returned to KSC, the ocular tissues were removed from both groups.\nStudy 4 Conclusions:  Approximately one in three astronauts flying on long-duration space missions experience visual impairment and morphologic changes to their eyes that include choroidal and retinal folds, optic disc edema, focal areas of retinal ischemia (i.e., cotton wool spots), globe flattening, and hyperopic shifts. This collection of ocular disorders has been termed Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS).  A variety of potential mechanisms have also been proposed to account for the unusual physiologic and pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings in astronauts, including elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP) from cephalad fluid shifts, altered autoregulation of cerebral perfusion, impaired cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the brain and orbital optic nerve sheath through venous, glymphatic, and lymphatic drainage systems, and disruption of blood-brain, blood-retinal, and blood-optic nerve barrier function. This seemingly multifaceted pathological process, which varies from astronaut to astronaut, indicates a complex origin for these neuro-ophthalmic findings associated with SANS.  The integrated DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome analysis demonstrates that spaceflight had profound effects on extracellular matrix (ECM) / cell junction and cell proliferation/apoptosis signaling in the retina.  Although these data do not address all the possible mechanisms involved in the etiology of SANS, they provide crucial insight into the potential adverse consequences of spaceflight on the retina that could be functionally important for maintaining proper visual acuity among astronauts.",

            "task_description": "The proposed Aspergillus fumigatus data mining (AFDM) project is a ground-based hypothesis-driven research investigation, derived from analyzing the “omics” data deposited in the GeneLab Data System (GLDS) that would translate spaceflight derived data into new knowledge. As A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen causing pathologies ranging from allergic asthma to invasive aspergillosis, we assessed several characteristics of the International Space Station (ISS) isolates in comparison to two experimentally established clinical isolates, Af293 and CEA10. Virulence assessment in a larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis revealed both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 as significantly more lethal compared to both Af293 and CEA10. Additionally, both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 exhibited significantly greater resistance to UV254 doses when compared to clinical isolates. We propose to assess that the enhanced virulence of the two ISS strains is mediated in part by up-regulation of spore pigments as a protective response to enhanced radiation in space.\nIn addition to the “omics” data of the A. fumigatus strains deposited in the GLDS, the AFDM project will combine and compare the  ground-based omics data that are either publicly available or generated by the Principal Investigator’s lab. The AFDM project will contribute to the ROSbio NASA Research Announcement NNH16ZTT001N-GL research emphasis (Systems Biology Experimental Research Using the GeneLab Data System) by generating new “omics” data about the fungal biology and adding it to the GeneLab for the benefit of future open science-based investigations in Earth. This will enable development of rapid microbial monitoring systems, countermeasures, novel pharmaceutical compounds, vaccine production, etc. The translational research aspects of the AFDM project are focusing the high-priority recommendations of the National Research Council's (NRC) Decadal Survey (P1. Establish a microbial observatory program on the ISS to conduct long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics).\nThe AFDM project will address specific NASA space biology-related questions by (a) investigating spaceflight omics data with specific aims to benefit human health (Aims 1 and 2), (b) addressing effects of spaceflight conditions on dynamics of microbes (fungi) with respect to cell processes such as understanding physiological responses (secondary metabolite production, Aims 2 and 3), UV resistance (Aim 3), and to the multiple stimuli encountered in spaceflight environments, and (c) characterizing the molecular responses in space grown fungi to pathogenesis (Aim 4). The objective is to provide NASA’s Space Biology program with “omics” information on how alterations in gravity affect genetic, mutational, metabolomic, and virulence characteristics in fungal species.\nBy datamining the “omics” of two ISS A. fumigatus strains, we will address the NASA’s Space Biology Program science element (microbiology) and its guiding questions: (a) How the genetic, molecular, and biochemical processes of the ISS A. fumigatus strains are influenced by the space environment and (b) What systems biology mechanisms and pathways are responsible for the enhanced virulence in ISS isolates (NASA Task report 2016; Bacterial, Archaeal, & Fungal Diversity of the ISS--HEPA Filter System; 19-12829-27 under Task Order NNN13D111T; Principal Investigator Kasthuri  Venkateswaran) when compared to the well characterized clinical isolates.",

In addition, we are performing biological research intended at advancing future human exploration missions. The AFDM project is related to fundamental research–gaining knowledge of spaceflight alterations in the fungi isolated from ISS to improve life on Earth. Understanding the molecular mechanisms in the spaceflight fungi might reveal the presence of potential stress-induced biomolecules that are essential to adapt to microgravity conditions. Such stress-induced biological system modifications could be identified and applied (early diagnostics and superior countermeasure development) to improve human health in immunocompromised subjects on Earth (children, the aged, and people living in closed systems, etc.), as well as recognize secondary metabolites that are useful compounds for the biotech industry (antibacterial, novel pharmaceuticals, etc.). Similarly, identification of stress-induced biomolecules that are antimicrobials will facilitate maintaining crew health and their closed habitat system for the future human exploration.     The AFDM project is focusing on:\na.       research aimed toward enabling the future of human exploration and   b.       on specific Earth-based disease (aspergillosis) pathways to gain insight from spaceflight “omics” data that may lead to new knowledge, treatments, and rapid diagnostic methods that will also improve life on Earth.     The outcome of the AFDM project will serve “dual-use” (Earth and space) purpose by investigating the common underlying molecular networks, pathways, and mechanisms of life in space-exposed fungi (and compare with Earth counterparts), which are important to understanding human health and environment in space, and will translate space-derived knowledge to address specific human health conditions and environments here on Earth. Therefore, spaceflight fungal “omics” data and ground-based investigations with direct translational research connections of the AFDM project will directly address the important priority of the NASA Space Biology mission."

            "task_progress": "Summary. Two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, were isolated from a HEPA filter and cupola wall of the International Space Station (ISS). As A. fumigatusis is an opportunistic pathogen causing pathologies ranging from allergic asthma to invasive aspergillosis, we assessed several characteristics of the ISS isolates in comparison to two experimentally established clinical isolates, Af293 and CEA10. Virulence assessment in a larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis revealed both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 as significantly more lethal compared to both Af293 and CEA10 (Knox  BP,  Blachowicz  A,  Palmer  JM,  Romsdahl  J,  Huttenlocher  A,  Wang  CC,  Keller  NP, Venkateswaran K. Aspergillus fumigatusisolates from air and surfaces of the International Space Station. mSphere. 2016 Oct 26;1(5):e00227-16). Additionally, both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 exhibited significantly greater resistance to UV254 doses when compared to clinical isolates (Blachowicz A, Knox BP, Romsdah lJ, Palmer JM, Huttenlocher A, Wang CCC, Keller NP, Venkateswaran K. 2016. Characterization of Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from air and surfaces of the International Space Station, 13th European Conference on Fungal Genetics, Paris, France, April 3-6, 2016). We hypothesized that the enhanced virulence of the two ISS strains is mediated in part by up-regulation of spore pigments as a protective response to enhanced radiation in space. Four spore pigments are known to contribute to virulence or toxicity (e.g., DH melanin, endocrocin, trypacidin, and fumigaclavine) and DH melanin is critical for UV protection for the fungus (the other pigments have not been assessed). The following two approaches were taken to address this hypothesis:     Spore pigments contribute to UV protection and virulence depending on fungal strain. We created an isogenic set of 6 strains differing only in presence of the synthase gene required to produce one spore metabolite and determined UV radiation sensitivity.     Enhanced UV resistance in evolution test. A controlled evolution study during which conidia of Af293 are exposed to sub-lethal doses of UV-C for 25 generations was conducted.\nWe presented a research poster titled “Investigation of enhanced virulence mechanisms in Aspergillus fumigatus isolates from the International Space Station” at the 30th Fungal Genetics Conference held in Pacific Grove, CA from March 12-17, 2019.

Data generated from the aforementioned GeneLab studies support this hypothesis, as these data have shown that µG: 1) induces higher levels of spontaneous DNA damage in human hematopoietic cells; 2) markedly alters the ability of mature human immune cells to respond appropriately to stimuli; 3) diminishes the ability of human lymphocytes to efficiently repair DNA damage in response to ionizing radiation; and 4) leads to alterations in the levels of multiple miRNAs that have been implicated in a variety of human hematopoietic malignancies.  We have also generated a wealth of data to support the hypothesis that µG and space radiation likely act synergistically to increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during a prolonged mission beyond LEO (low Earth orbit). In the present proposal, we will build upon these data by performing studies to directly test the ability of µG to increase the risk of leukemic transformation in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC), while simultaneously reducing the ability of generated immune cells from recognizing and removing any malignant clones that arise.",

Moreover, microgravity also appears to impair the ability of human HSC to generate functional dendritic cells, which act as critical sentinels within the immune system, detecting infectious invaders and cells that have undergone malignant transformation, and alerting/priming immune effectors to eliminate these threats. Further adding to these deleterious effects, we have also found that microgravity negatively affects the ability of human natural killer (NK) cells to recognize and lyse human leukemic cells. Taken together, our results to date have shown that conditions of microgravity present during spaceflight could add to the risks of leukemogenesis as a result of exposure to space radiation, both by impairing the ability of human HSC to repair the induced damage and by crippling the generation and function of the immune cells needed to recognize and eliminate cells damaged by the radiation.  An understanding of the mechanism(s) by which microgravity affects and impairs these different processes could lead to the development of novel methods to target and augment these pathways, and thereby enhance the processes of DNA repair and anti-tumor immunity. Such developments could have a profound impact on the treatment of cancer and on the lives of patients suffering from this disease."

            "task_description": "Astronauts are exposed to weightlessness and ionizing radiation during spaceflight. To combat the bone loss that results from weightlessness, astronauts spend a substantial amount of time exercising or, in the future, will be exposed to artificial gravity as a countermeasure. We aim to study these environmental conditions using basic biological models in ground-based work that lays the ground work for future work.\nThroughout life, bone remodeling is intimately tied to sex steroid hormones and their activated receptors. In females, estrogen receptors regulate growth plate closure, cessation of periosteal and endosteal bone growth, and cessation of cancellous bone resorption, among other things. Whether sex-steroid hormones and their receptors are modulated in skeletal tissue during long-duration spaceflight is unclear.\nThis Presidential Early Career Award for Scientist and Engineers (PECASE) award consisted of five sub-projects:\nProject 1, Title: Epigenetic Regulation During Simulated Spaceflight: MicroRNA Expression and Methylation-Specific Sequencing. Description and Aim: This work complements the methylation work performed in the previous Space Biology New Investigator Grant (\"Bone Loss During Simulated Weightlessness: The Role of Osteoclasts\", ended 2015), by allowing ‘omics approaches to cover larger swaths of the genome (e.g., whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing). Additionally, this project will extend the type of epigenetic mechanisms to be studied beyond DNA methylation, specifically, microRNA expression. Hypotheses: Removal of mechanical loading or, oppositely, elevations of mechanical loading induce pro-bone resorbing or pro-bone forming changes in bone cell gene expression, respectively, via epigenetic mechanisms.\nProject 2, Title: Skeletal Sex Hormone Receptors and Simulated Spaceflight. Description and Aim: This work complements an upcoming space mission (Principal Investigator (PI) : Lane Christenson, former PI Joseph Tash, Kansas University of Medical Center-KUMC, co-I April Ronca) and will define the skeletal response of female mice to simulated long-duration spaceflight in the context of sex hormones and their receptor levels in leg bones. The biological assays used included gene expression or protein quantification in bone and blood. Additionally, we will investigate cage effects on estrous cyclicity. Finally, we aim to develop an artificial-intelligence algorithm for high-throughput quantification of cell imagery of the mouse estrous cycle. Hypotheses: Mechanical disuse reduces the levels of circulating sex hormones and their receptor levels in bone. These changes contribute to understanding skeletal deterioration during long-duration spaceflight.\nAs part of this project, we proposed for and were awarded lumbar vertebrae from the Rodent Research 1 mission from the Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). We were able to quantify the cancellous bone changes from spaceflight, which will aid in future mission planning with Lane Christenson and Joe Tash.\nProject 3, Title: Investigating the effects of ionizing-radiation exposure on bone’s collagen mechanical properties. Description: Astronauts embarking on a deep-space mission to Mars will be exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation. This is of potential concern since ionizing radiation has been shown in other applications, such as radiotherapy treatment, to increase risk of fracture. While spaceflight-relevant radiation experiments so far have shown a quantitative degeneration of the tissue through loss of tissue mass, here we assessed the effects of such radiation on tissue quality. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that radiation-induced changes in collagen crosslinks would decrease the ability of mouse vertebrae to withstand cyclic mechanical loading.\nFor this project, I co-mentored an NASA Space Technology Fellow and Doctoral Candidate from University of California Berkeley, Megan Pendleton. (Megan’s fellowship covers her stipend, but does not cover animal procurement and housing. Thus, I am covering the latter and some related expenses.) This is a collaboration with Tony Keaveny (UC Berkeley) and Jean Sibonga (Johnson Space Center-JSC).\nProject 4, Title: The role of Nuclear Cytoskeleton in the Osteocytic response to Simulated Weightlessness. Description and Aim: This project aims to investigate the role of nuclear-cytoskeletal elements (LINC, Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton complexes) and related signaling cascades in the skeletal response to simulated weightlessness and radiation exposure. Description: This is a collaboration with Gunes Uzer, Boise State Univ. We investigated gene expression levels indicative of changes in this critical and emerging cytoskeletal complex.\nProject 5, Title: Characterizing the effects of chronic 2G centrifugation on the rat skeletal system. Description: This is a collaboration with Charles Fuller (UC Davis) and April Ronca (NASA Ames Research Center-ARC). Our long-term plan is to assess artificial gravity (AG) as a possible solution to mitigate these changes. In this study, one of our aims is to determine the skeletal acclimation to chronic centrifugation. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a 2G hypergravity environment causes an anabolic response in growing male rats. Specifically, we predict chronic 2G to increase tissue mineral density, bone volume fraction of the cancellous tissue, and to increase overall bone strength. Systemically, we predict that bone formation markers (i.e., osteocalcin) are elevated and resorption markers (i.e., tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) are decreased or unchanged from controls.\nProjects conducted under this award addressed multiple Research Recommendations for Animal Biology and Developmental & Reproductive Biology stated in the Space Biology Science Plan and the National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey, Recapturing Space: Life and Physical Sciences for a New Era of Exploration.

He will also help trouble-shoot the system should it be necessary. He will play a major role in data interpretation, data analysis, and data management. He will help guide the ground control design and construction both on site (at the DLR) as well as remotely at NASA Ames. In addition, Mancinelli will take the lead in developing a conceptual model describing the effects of micro-gravity on the growth and development of biofilms as well as for the biofilms grown on metallic inhibitor surfaces.\nTo achieve many of the goals of NASA’s and European Space Agency (ESA)’s space programs requires an enduring human presence in space. Long term human missions require sustained crew health and safety. A research area that is important in sustaining crew health is the development of improved spaceflight-suitable methods for microbiological monitoring, as well as contamination control and reduction. The International Space Station (ISS) is a confined and isolated habitat in an extreme, hostile environment. The human and habitat microflora varies in response to changes in environmental conditions aboard the ISS. Changes in the microflora may result in an increased health risk for the crew. Microorganisms including microbial biofilms have been found on various habitat surfaces, inside the air and water handling systems as well as the hardware used on the ISS. Biofilms are known to cause damage to equipment from polymer deterioration, metal corrosion, and bio-fouling. The primary concern regarding crew health is characterized by activity of opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms that have been noted to accumulate in the closed environments of the ISS and other spacecraft on long-duration missions. Understanding the effects of the space environment, especially altered gravity, on microbial biofilms is crucial for the success of long-term human space missions. Surface-associated biofilm communities were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the ISS. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of human immune function observed during spaceflight. Various studies have shown that certain metals reduce the number of contact-mediated microbial infections. Antimicrobial surfaces are defined as materials that contain an antimicrobial agent (such as silver, copper, and their alloys) that inhibits or reduces the ability of microorganisms to grow on the surface of a material. Antimicrobial surfaces are functionalized in a variety of different processes. The introduction of antimicrobial surfaces for medical, pharmaceutical, and industrial purposes has shown their unique potential for reducing and preventing microbial contamination. The contact killing of several types of microorganisms by copper has been assessed in multiple laboratory in-vitro studies. For sustained crew health and safety additional studies on the mechanisms involved in the formation of microbial biofilms and their efficient destruction under spaceflight conditions, i.e., long-term growth and adaptation to low gravity environments, are needed.\nThe hypothesis to be tested by this project is that surfaces containing copper and/or silver will inhibit biofilm formation under altered gravity regimes to a lesser extent than in 1 x g due to the fact that the interaction with the metal ions on the surface is slower because their movement around the cell is restricted to diffusion. The objective is to determine the effect and the rate, if any, of copper and/or silver surfaces on microbial growth rate, total biomass accumulation, and biofilm formation. The goal is to develop a conceptual model describing the effect of micro-gravity on biofilm formation grown on non-inhibiting surfaces as well as on metal surfaces that are potential biofilm growth inhibitors.\nThe approach will be to test three different microbial model systems (i.e., Escherichia coli K12, a Staphylococcus sp. isolate from the ISS, and the heavy metal resistant strain Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34) for biofilm formation on various copper- and silver-surfaces, as well as inert surfaces as controls. These surfaces differ in their antimicrobial activity based on chemical composition and/or geometric nanostructures. These surfaces will be tested for biofilm formation rates under different spaceflight relevant gravitational regimes (e.g., Moon 0.16 x g, Mars 0.38 x g, µg ISS and 1 x g control). Microbial growth will occur under optimal biofilm-inducing conditions conducted in the KUBIK incubator inside the European Drawer Rack under defined gravitational influences. Biofilm/metal surface samples and controls will be subjected to an intense analysis program, including various microbiological, genetic, molecular biological, chemical, material-science, and structural investigations. The data generated will be of immense importance for understanding the influence of µg and the ISS environment on biofilm formation as well as for the evaluation and production of improved antimicrobial additives, coating, components, surfaces and textiles for short- and long-term utilization for present and future astronaut-/robotic-associated activities in space exploration.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Microbial biofilms are known to cause persistent infections as well as degrade a variety of materials including metals. Biofilms are notorious for their persistence and resistance to eradication.  The use of antimicrobial surfaces provides an alternative strategy for inhibiting microbial growth and biofilm formation to conventional cleaning procedures and the use of disinfectants. Antimicrobial surfaces contain organic or inorganic compounds, such as antimicrobial peptides or copper and silver, that inhibit microbial growth. The objectives of this project include determining the efficacy of biofilm inhibition by different oxidation states of metals and inhibition by nanoscale texture patterns on various metals.  The results from the nano-scale texture patterns represent a new technology that is applicable to inhibiting biofilm formation in hospitals, and also in the pharmaceutical and industries where biofilm corrosion is a problem."

            "task_progress": "BIOFILMS 1:\nThe first flight occurred on Aug 29, 2021 (0714 GMT) with SpaceX CRS-23 (SpX-23). The hardware was successfully loaded into KUBIK and the experiment was conducted successfully. [Ed. Note: KUBIK is a small controlled-temperature incubator or cooler with removable inserts designed for self-contained microgravity experiments. KUBIK is located inside the European Space Agency's Columbus module.] The samples were fixed and returned to Earth.  On October 17, 2021, the samples arrived at the German Space Agency (“Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt” or \"DLR\") and the analysis of the flight samples completed. The preliminary data are similar to that for Biofilms 2 (see below).  Additionally, a postflight debriefing meeting with the European Space Agency (ESA) was held.\nBIOFILMS 2:\nSamples for the BIOFILMS 2 flight were prepared in coordination with ESA and Keyser Italia. BIOFILMS 2 launched at the end of July 2022. The decision to delay was driven by the potential risk linked with the time window available for BIOFILMS 2 readiness, squeezed to 2 months by SpX-23 and SpX-24 launch dates.  Moreover, ESA was informed by SpaceX that cold stowage capabilities on SpX-24 were overly subscribed, and no room was available for BIOFILMS 2. We had a similar risk for SpX-23 that would have required a re-design of the BIOFILMS packaging to fit the hardware (HW) in only one Double Cold Bag (DCB). The decision was made to launch BIOFILM 2 on SpX-25 in July. The samples were returned in August 2022.\nBIOFILMS 3:\nThe samples were prepared as for BIOFILMS 1 and 2 and launched March 2023 and returned in April 2023.\nPost-flight Analysis\nThe post-flight analysis included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence microscopy of the bacterial cultures and biofilms. The SEM analysis allows detailed insights into biofilm morphology, matrix structure, and overall integrity of the bacteria. Via focused ion beam-SEM (FIB-SEM) cross-sectioning, biofilm thickness and structure in direct relation to the available surface topography can be assessed by high resolution imaging. For the fluorescence microscopic analysis, different fluorescent dyes were used, such as DAPI for straining nucleic acids and biofilm matrix straining dyes such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-marked wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). [Ed. Note: DAPI is a flourescent stain that binds to regions in DNA.]\nMaterial Characterization\nBy comparing the data from the preflight experiments, the topographical and chemical influence of the bacteria (e.g., through corrosive material removal) on the substrate is determined. This allows both the ability to determine the damaging influence of bacterial biofilms on the surface, and local damage providing an indication of the presence and activity of bacteria during the experiment. This provides data to determine any differences in bacterial behavior due to changes in gravity, as well as the weighting of short-scale interactions such as Van der Waals forces on colonization behavior through close comparison with the proteomic analyses. Localized surface disruption, oxide growth, and chemical surface modification are investigated localized via FIB-SEM and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), while phase analysis of the substrate and oxide films is conducted via grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD). Additionally, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used for the analysis of metal ions diffused into the medium. The method allows the determination of metal ions in a wide dynamic concentration range from parts-per-trillion (ppt) to parts-per-million (ppm).\nResults\na.  Patterning at both the 3 micron and 800 nm levels seems to stress all three organisms (Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, Cupriavidus metallidurans, and Acinetobacter radioresistens), as evidenced by the production of more extracellular material (presumably mostly extracellular polysaccharides) on all metal surfaces.\nb. Copper shows clear inhibition of microbial growth. The SEM photomicrographs clearly show damaged/lysed cells.\nc. Brass coupons appear to inhibit microbial growth, but less than copper. More copper ions were detected in the medium from the cells grown on copper coupons than on the brass coupons.       d. The extracellular material produced on the copper and brass plates has a more spotty/blotchy appearance than the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the stainless steel plates.  This was attributed to the interaction of copper with the EPS. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) analyses are underway to discern the differences and similarities.\nStatistical analyses are being conducted on the data and will be published within the coming months.",

Surprisingly, the small worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a good, cost-effective model for studying the effects of spaceflight upon muscle. Our past experiments on Earth and on the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that the expression of key muscle genes that encode members of a muscle attachment complex is reduced in C. elegans during spaceflight. A key open question is if and how these changes in gene expression result in reduced muscle strength in response to spaceflight. While reduced force production is documented for astronauts, it is yet to be demonstrated for C. elegans. To address this critical knowledge gap, we developed a tiny new device that enables continuous measurement of worm muscle forces. Using this device, on Earth, we have shown that defects in muscle attachment complexes lead to decline in worm muscle strength. Motivated by these past flight data and ground results, we propose to (a) demonstrate the flight-readiness of our miniaturized device for quantitative characterization of muscle strength of C. elegans, (b) test our hypothesis, based on past flight data, that muscle strength decreases in flight as a result of altered muscle gene expression in the worm, and (c) quantify muscle strength loss in spaceflight across multiple worm generations. Successful measurements of muscle strength in flight will make C. elegans a much more complete and comprehensive genomic model for muscle physiology, enabling meaningful translation of discoveries made in C. elegans to astronauts. Our proposed studies have important spin out implications for sarcopenia (an urgent public health problem on Earth) and may produce a terrestrial model for testing potential therapeutic interventions for muscle strength decline in flight.",

            "task_progress": "A major impediment to long-duration space travel is loss of muscle mass and strength during spaceflight. Surprisingly, the microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) is a good, cost-effective model for studying the effects of spaceflight upon muscle. Our past experiments on Earth and the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that the expression of key muscle genes that encode members of a muscle attachment complex is reduced in C.elegans during spaceflight. A key open question is if and how these changes in gene expression result in reduced muscle strength in response to spaceflight. While reduced force production is documented for astronauts, it is yet to be demonstrated for C.elegans.\nTo address this critical knowledge gap, we developed a miniaturized device dubbed \"NemaFlex\" that enables continuous measurement of worm muscle forces based on deflection of soft micropillars. We integrated the NemaFlex device into a worm loading apparatus, so that gravid adult animals of a specific size can be sorted from mixed cultures and evaluated for muscle strength in individual chambers. The spaceflight hardware and worm culture bags were flown as the Micro-16 experiment to the ISS on February 20, 2021, as part of the Northrop Grumman Cygnus NG-15 cargo mission. Experiments were successfully conducted with the crew recording videos of worms deflecting the micropillars in the NemaFlex device. The key results from the spaceflight investigation are: (1) The body diameter of wild-type worms decreased compared to ground controls, potentially due to altered metabolism; (2) The muscle strength of space-adapted worms was lower than that of corresponding worms cultured on ground. Thus, the Micro-16 experiment showed that muscle strength decline occurs in a physiologically relevant animal model, similar to that found in astronauts.\nThe scientific impact of this study is significant as it opens avenues for future investigations to identify drugs that could alleviate the muscle strength decline in space. This spaceflight project contributed to training of more than a dozen personnel, including students and postdocs, on C. elegans, microfluidics and space biology. The funded work resulted in 16 peer-reviewed publications, several student awards, outreach to K-12 students and commercialization of new technologies.",

            "task_description": "While unexpected responses in microorganisms are well documented for short duration culture, the impact of long duration, multigenerational growth of microorganisms in the chronic stress of microgravity has not been investigated. The implications of this gap in knowledge are tremendous, as the response to short duration growth in microgravity alters gene expression, pathogenesis-related stress responses (ex., biofilm formation and resistance to antibiotics), and virulence. Moreover, it is known that stress responses (including chronic stress) can increase mutagenesis in bacteria leading to genomic plasticity, which may provide novel mechanistic insight into genomic instability underlying resistance to antibiotics, pathogenicity, and virulence. We propose that long-term growth in spaceflight culture will induce heritable genomic and epigenetic changes in microorganisms with adverse phenotypic outcomes that could have a profound impact on the risk to crew health and vehicle system performance. Our previous studies aboard the Space Shuttle investigated the response of the model enteric pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) to short duration spaceflight culture and demonstrated a significant increase in virulence in a murine model of infection, in addition to biofilm formation, as compared to identically grown cultures on the ground. In addition, global microarray and proteomic analyses revealed that 167 transcripts (including small noncoding RNAs/ncRNAs) and 73 proteins changed expression, with the evolutionarily conserved protein Hfq identified as a likely global regulator involved in the response to this environment. Hfq binds to small ncRNAs thereby facilitating their association with mRNAs, the outcome of which plays a diverse role in regulating gene expression, virulence, stress responses, antibiotic resistance, DNA methylation, and genome stability. We hypothesize that long-term multigenerational culture of S. Typhimurium in the spaceflight environment will result in stress-induced mutations and genomic instability as reflected in changes in the genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and select phenotypic characteristics (including virulence) that will reflect a central role for Hfq as a global regulator of these heritable responses. To address this hypothesis, we propose to characterize the impact of long term spaceflight culture (at least 100 generations) of an S. Typhimurium wild type and hfq mutant on the genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, virulence, and pathogenesis-related characteristics of these strains.  This proposal addresses Research Emphasis 2 - ISS (International Space Station) Microbial Observatory Studies from section B.3 of this announcement, as it is designed to “take advantage of the technological maturity, low cost, and speed of genomic analyses and the rapid generation time of microbes to monitor the evolution of microbial genomic changes in response to the selective pressures present in the spaceflight environment.” In addition, by employing genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic analysis, this proposal also addresses the Research Emphasis 1 – Spaceflight Omics Studies in section B.2.  In its design, this proposal will address the NASA Space Biology Plan, Overarching Questions CMM-1a, CMM-1d, and CMM5.  This proposal also directly addresses the highest priority recommendations from the Decadal Survey for the establishment of an ISS Microbial Observatory conducting long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics (Priority P1). In addition, this study analyzes “microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in spaceflight environments,” as described by the panel in Priority P2.",

The purpose of this Space Act Agreement is to enhance the ability of NASA and the Sloan Foundation to support scientific research and the dissemination of information about the effect of spaceflight on microbial ecosystems in spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) through sponsorship of postdoctoral fellowships. NASA is providing the isolates for all studies.\nThe disease-causing organisms Burkholderia multivorans, B. cepacia, genomovars of the B. cepacia complex (BCC), as well as an unclassified species of Burkholderia, and its relatives Ralstonia pickettii and R. insidiosa account for 60% of the bacterial isolates obtained from the filtrated water system on board the International Space Station (ISS). Members of these genera can survive long periods in a planktonic state in distilled water or as biofilms within an infected individual. They are also natively resistant to several antibiotics leaving treatment options complex. For BCC organisms, this complexity is increased by the phenomenon of bacterial persistence where a genetically identical subpopulation of the bacteria sustains under high antibiotic challenge by a reduction in metabolism and other unknown mechanisms. A healthy astronaut could easily clear a BCC or Ralstonia sp. infection; however, after prolonged spaceflight, a potentially immunocompromised astronaut with repeated exposure to these organisms could be at risk for disease.\nTo understand the mechanisms that would contribute to altered virulence in ISS BCC and Ralstonia species, the genomes of 67 isolates from 22 missions will be sequenced and compared to their respective ATCC BCC or Ralstonia strain. The potential for increased virulence will be determined by the presence of genes clustered as pathogenicity islands in the respective genome. To establish if the strains are becoming more resistant to antibiotics, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) will be determined for each isolate using six antibiotics currently used to treat the infections and then compared to the respective ATCC control strain. Finally, a transposon library will be generated for the most virulent, resistant, tolerant, or persistent strain, and this library will be cultured in distilled water to simulate conditions on the ISS. Here we will identify genes which aid in the survivorship of BCC and Ralstonia strains in the water system of the ISS. The knowledge gained from this genomic sequencing and Tnseq study will allow us to assess any increased virulence or infection potential, as well as help to make antibiotic recommendations, predict target genes where inhibition by adjuvants will enhance antibiotic therapy, or present novel water treatment options to eradicate the BCC/Ralstonia strains from the potable water of the ISS.",

These bacterial isolates cultured from the ISS PWD have originated from Earth. The effects upon them, as the result of exposure to microgravity, lowered shear forces, and increased radiation in the Earth’s upper atmosphere where the ISS orbits, are unknown. Our work benefits life on Earth by way of planetary protection, a facet of NASA since the start of the Apollo missions. The goal of planetary protection is to prevent any forward contamination to other celestial bodies as well as to prevent any back contamination to Earth.

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORTING JANUARY 2020\nThe overall goal of the project # 80NSSC17K0035 is to use “omic” studies to characterize the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Ralstonia species that have been isolated from the potable water dispenser (PWD) of International Space Station (ISS). The PWD is the source of all consumed water aboard the ISS; therefore, the surveillance of these species, which are known to be opportunistic pathogens, is relevant to ensure crew health. The isolates were evaluated for any increase in virulence or infection potential and assayed for antibiotic resistance to address. The genomes and phenotypic results for the ISS BCC isolates have now been written up and the manuscript has been accepted by PLOS One as of December 16, 2019.\nIn Year 2, a transposon library was successfully constructed in an ISS Burkholderia contaminans isolate. However, we were unable to run the experiment due to the elemental iodine selected for treatment being a controlled pre-cursor substance in the state of California; unfortunately, the experiment has been on hold due to the inability to procure iodine.\nOverall our research shows that within each species, the 19 B. cepacia and 5 B. contaminans, recovered from the ISS PWD over roughly a 5-year timespan, were highly similar on a whole genome scale, suggesting each population (here meaning one for each species) that was sampled may have stemmed from two distinct founding strains. This is supported by all isolates demonstrating greater than 99% ANI with 95-99.9% alignment in all cases, and sharing a core pangenome of greater than 90% of identified gene clusters (within species). The vast majority of differences in gene-content that were identified in the pangenome were localized on putative plasmids. Physiologically, including antibiotic sensitivities, the ISS-derived isolates were overall generally similar to each other, as well as to the reference type-strains analyzed. In cases where ISS-derived isolates did vary, no strong correlations were found between physiology and either single-nucleotide variant (SNV) distances or date of isolation (though it is also import to keep in mind date of isolation does not necessarily indicate any information about how long an isolate had been aboard the ISS). While it is interesting the 5 recovered B. contaminans isolates were all isolated in a span of time over 2013 and 2014 during which no B. cepacia were isolated, we cannot speak at this time to what may have caused this (if anything). That aside, our analysis here suggests these two species’ populations sampled by way of isolation seem to be highly similar genetically regardless of date of isolation, with the majority of variation that does exist being maintained among putative plasmids. Based on our phenotypic evaluation of the ability of these isolates to lyse or intracellularize within macrophage, in comparison to the reference type-strains, it seems likely that the two populations of Burkholderia present in the ISS PWS are not more virulent than those that might be encountered on planet.\nCompleted Publications\n1.\tAubrie O’Rourke, Michael D.

Accepted and published.\nANNUAL REPORTING APRIL 2019\nAim 1: To determine the potential for enhanced virulence and pathogenicity of Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Ralstonia strains isolated from the filtration unit of the ISS by genomic sequencing.\nUnder Aim 1, to determine the potential for enhanced virulence and pathogenicity of BCC and Ralstonia strains isolated from the filtration unit of the ISS, the hypothesis follows that the sequencing and analysis of the 67 genomes of these two genera from 22 missions and their comparison to the genomic sequences of the respective ATCC BCC and Ralstonia strain controls will reveal known and novel pathogenicity islands and integrative conjugative elements (ICEs). The genes contained within these mobile genetic elements (MGEs) will allow us to gauge to what degree the presence of the genera in the ISS filtrated water systems pose a human health threat via their infection potential.\nAim 1 objectives are complete; we have successfully sequenced all genomes and analyzed the dataset. We find that the ISS isolates have genomes that are distinct from that of terrestrial isolates and are set apart by the genes harbored on conjugative plasmids. Furthermore, among the ISS isolates plasmid composition also varies. We hypothesize that while the isolates exhibit varying degrees of genomic erosion, such erosion is mitigated by the presence of conjugative plasmids which can rescue a reduced genome when facing environmental stress. In the scenario of the ISS PWD, the isolates may form biofilms, as we have displayed in year 1 that Burkholderia species have the propensity to do so. Plasmids may be shuffled among the biofilm or aid planktonic isolates in overcoming the iodine challenges used to decontaminate the system. Year 2 transposon sequencing will shed light on whether or not this mechanism of plasmid shuffling is used to counter disinfection.\nAim 2: To determine antibiotic persistence of BCC and Ralstonia strains isolated from the filtration unit of the ISS using Tnseq.\nUnder Aim 2, performed in order to determine how the BCC isolates persist in the potable water system of the ISS, we first hypothesized that ISS strains, which have been placed under the selective pressure of the ISS water systems oligotrophic environment, will experience varying degrees of antibiotic tolerance due to this previous selective pressure. We found that their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) do not differ from that of the terrestrial control under our antibiotics tested. However, a Tnseq analysis will reveal the mechanisms, including virulence factors that contribute to the ability of the BCC and Ralstonia strains to persist in the oligotrophic filtrated ISS water system. We hypothesize that genes conferred by conjugative plasmids aid in isolate survival of these bacterial species within the water system.\nThe Year 2 goal for Aim 2 will include generating and assessing the gene survivorship index of a representative transposon library subject to distilled water conditions to simulate the environment of the ISS potable water system. In a Tnseq study, I will determine the genes associated with aiding in the maintenance of BCC bacteria in this ISS filtrated water system. Here a representative strain of BCC, which exhibits the greatest reduction in antibiotic susceptibility or tolerance will be selected for transposon mutagenesis. This technique of introducing a transposon to generate a library of insertional mutants and subsequent culturing of the library under a selective condition is known as Tnseq. The ISS specimen Tnseq library will be cultured in distilled water simulating the environmental conditions of the ISS water system. Subsequent sequencing analysis will allow us to determine which genes, including virulence factors, play a key role in the maintenance of the genera in the water systems of the ISS. All data will be made public and results will be published.\nAim 2 objectives are 50% complete--we have successfully profiled all isolates for their antibiotic susceptibility. We are currently optimizing the Tnseq experiment. We expect to observe the genes which when mutated increase and detract from survival under distilled water treatment over time. We expect that the addition of iodine at 8 ppm or 40 ppm will alter this gene set in relation to the distilled water control. This comparison will reveal the mechanism used by the isolates to persist in the PWD despite disinfection treatment which is used to reduce the microbial load after stagnation in the ISS potable water system. We reason that if the genes conferred by plasmids are beneficial to overcome stress, then the mutants of these genes in the Tnseq library will be less represented in the iodine treated samples and therefore have a lower survival index than in the distilled water sample.",

            "task_description": "Health of the musculoskeletal system depends on exposure to mechanical loading. Removal or reduction of mechanical loading precipitates muscle atrophy and bone loss. Thus, despite rigorous exercise protocols and other countermeasures, muscle atrophy and bone loss are still virtually inevitable consequences of spaceflight. One approach for ameliorating the development of these untoward consequences of space travel is by the induction of artificial gravity during spaceflight via centrifugation. The strength of the artificial gravity depends both on the speed of rotation and diameter of the ship. While it is possible to achieve centrifugal force equivalent 1.0 G, it is also possible that lower levels of force may also be effective for preventing muscle atrophy and irreversible bone loss.  In this study, we propose to evaluate the potential effectiveness of artificial gravity for the prevention of muscle atrophy and weakness and bone loss by studying rats using an innovative system for partial unloading that has been developed previously for mice by members of our team. We will study the musculoskeletal response of adult male rats (n=14 / group) following exposure to different degrees of unloading representing 0.2 G, 0.4 G, and 0.7 G as well as fully loaded animals for 1, 2, and 4 weeks. We will study the impact of this partial gravity analog environment on muscle and bone structure and function, including performing histological analyses, in situ force measurement of muscle contraction, as well as measurement of bone mass, microarchitecture, and strength. In addition, we will perform both serological and tissue molecular analyses to better understand the mechanisms and time course of development of these changes at different degrees of unloading. This work will also allow us to more effectively understand the relationship between the development of muscle atrophy and weakness and bone deterioration at varying levels of artificial gravity.  At the conclusion of this study, we will have defined the potential impact of partial artificial gravity for prevention of musculoskeletal dysfunction and deterioration. This work will inform the future application of artificial gravity in human research and space exploration.",

            "task_description": "May 2015 Revision to Task Agreement (Ed. note: information received September 2015).\nDue to problems obtaining samples from Kibo-JEM (Japanese Experiment Module), the project has been modified with a new title, “Bacterial, Archaeal, & Fungal Diversity of the ISS--HEPA Filter System.” The revised scope will allow the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to undertake a 28-month flight study to examine the microorganisms associated with HEPA filters. The ISS-HEPA project will develop a comprehensive census of the microbial population on the HEPA filter collected from various locations of the International Space Station (ISS), using genetic biosignatures and computational modeling. This microbial census will provide NASA with the ability to accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to overall microbial profiles, the JPL team will determine which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health.\nOriginal Task Description: Space microbiology research working groups in Japan, authorized by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), submitted proposals in response to the JAXA Announcement of Opportunity, 2012. The JAXA proposal that is managed by Principal Investigator Prof. Masao Nasu, Osaka University, contained several subgroups, including subgroup 4, headed by Dr. Takashi Yamazaki, JAXA. This subgroup 4 will conduct an investigation on “Analysis of microbial dynamics in the space habitation system by using new molecular microbial ecological techniques and also monitoring microbial contamination from air and surfaces of the ‘Kibo’ Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo-JEM).” The JAXA proposal submitted by subgroup 4 identifies the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) team headed by Dr. Kasthuri Venkateswaran as a collaborator to jointly explore the investigation.\nThe Bacterial, Archaeal, and Fungal Diversity of Kibo-JEM Surfaces project (JPL-JAXA project) will undertake a three-year flight study to examine the changes in the microorganism population on the Kibo-JEM surfaces. The JPL-JAXA project proposes to develop a comprehensive census of the microbial population on the Kibo-JEM surfaces, using genetic biosignatures and computational modeling. This census will provide NASA and JAXA with the ability to accurately and confidently assess the status of microbes associated with closed habitation and crew health maintenance. In addition to overall microbial profiles, the JPL-JAXA team will determine which microbial taxa pose particular threats to crew health. Specific JPL-JAXA project goals will enable us to resolve applicable Human Research Program (HRP) integrated research plan (IRP) risks: (1) determine if changes in Kibo-JEM microbiome are occurring during a spaceflight mission and if so, (2) determine whether any changes noted would create a greater health risk for the crew.\nThere are three aims proposed in this JPL-JAXA project and study of the Kibo-JEM microbiome. Through optimizations and comparative evaluations of methods designed to collect, process, analyze, and archive biomolecules sampled, the JPL-JAXA team will increase downstream sensitivity of laboratory assays as well as enhance the current understanding of the population dynamics of the Kibo-JEM module (Aim 1). The JPL-JAXA team will adapt molecular technologies currently in use with the National Institute of Health (NIH) – Human Microbiome Program (HMP) Roadmap—such as rRNA gene-variable region tag sequencing, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS), and DNA microarrays, as well as cloning and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)—to comprehensively elucidate the microbial diversity profiles associated with the Kibo-JEM surfaces (Aim 2). The final project deliverable to NASA will be the Kibo-JEM database, a compilation of all of the genomic sequences and genetic information of microbes encountered on and within the Kibo-JEM habitat (Aim 3). Computational modeling of the Kibo-JEM microbial population dynamics inferred from the database will then be carried out to predict the complete spectrum of organisms present.\nThe JPL-JAXA project will compare microbial diversity, microbial characteristics, and functional capabilities of the microorganisms associated with the Kibo-JEM. The resulting database will enable HRP to evaluate the effect of spaceflight radiation and microgravity on the Kibo-JEM microbiome. The JPL-JAXA project in combination with results from studies of crew susceptibility will be used to determine the risk of microbiologically induced adverse health effects during a spaceflight mission. This assessment will allow HRP to determine if current operational and engineering controls used to mitigate microbiological risks are adequate or whether additional countermeasures should be developed.",

            "task_progress": "During this task, an inventory of microorganisms isolated from the HEPA filters and environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) as well as crew resupply vehicles (CRV) during multiple NASA projects have been archived, and inventoried under Space Biology Microbial Culture Collection (SBMCC). The whole-genome sequences (WGS) of SBMCC were generated and made available to the public. In addition to multiple copies of same microbial species, the SBMCC consists of several newly identified microorganisms. The WGS of the characterized bacterial isolates include Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriales, Bacillaceae, Agrobacterium, Klebsiella, Methylobacterium, and Staphylococcus. Moreover, isolates of fungi have also been sequenced, belonging to the members of fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.\nThis SBMCC archival of the ISS and CRV will aid in the ongoing characterization of short sequence, shot-gun metagenome surveys of the microbial diversity present in these built environments. The availability of these new WGS will also enable genetic comparisons between microorganisms sampled from Earth-based environments with those sampled from spacecraft surfaces of the ISS and CRV. Such comparisons will help to elucidate genetic adaptations that allow some of these microorganisms to become more virulent and allow all of them to survive the harsh environment of space (e.g., ionizing radiation, microgravity, desiccation, and oxidative stress). Additionally, when annotated, functional analyses of these WGS can help to identify targeted strategies for the control of problematic microorganisms that may degrade metals and plastics, become potentially pathogenic and harm astronauts, or obstruct water supply due to their biofilm forming capabilities in the engineering systems of the closed habitat.",

            "task_description": "This project has accomplished one of its two milestones, and the updated summary provided now reflects not only the conceptual genesis of the project, but also as it was refined as the project progressed. While, of course, the original essence remains, what is presented here is the summit of the first milestone, and precedes previous reports. This milestone is concerned with Earth studies to develop and rigorously test the technology for determining the sensitivity of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) during spaceflight, and to elucidate the genetic basis of whatever change is seen. The second milestone is experimentation during the spaceflight itself, which was launched in late 2017.\nA paper entitled: “Payload hardware and experimental protocol development to enable future testing of the effect of space microgravity on the resistance to gentamicin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and its (sigma)s-deficient mutant,” was published online in May 2017: Life Sciences in Space Research 15 (2017) 1–10 2214-5524/ © 2017 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Published by Elsevier Ltd.; [\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001\n] As has been pointed out before, this project represents highly collaborative and collegial collaboration between Stanford and NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The published paper reflects this not only by the joint authorship of it by both Stanford and Moffett Field scientists, but also the benefits that accrue from collaboration between biological expertise (Stanford) and the flight technological expertise (Moffett Field).\nThe list of authors is as follows: AC Matin, J-H Wang, Mimi Keyhan, Rachna Singh, and Michael Benoit of the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at Stanford School of Medicine; and Macarena P. Parra, Michael R. Padgen, Antonio J. Ricco, Matthew Chin, Charlie R. Friedericks, Tori N. Chinn, Aaron Cohen, Michael B. Henschke, Timothy V. Snyder, Matthew P. Lera, Shannon S. Ross, Christina M. Mayberry, Sungshin Choi, Diana T. Wu, Ming X. Tan, Travis D. Boone, Christopher C. Beasley, and Stevan M. Spremo, of NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA.   The abstract of this paper, reproduced here (in quotes), succinctly describes the evolved conceptual background, and demonstrates in detail the development of the EcAMSat platform, and its thorough testing using spaceflight-like commands.\n“Human immune response is compromised and bacteria can become more antibiotic resistant in space microgravity (MG). We report that under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), stationary-phase uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) become more resistant to gentamicin (Gm), and that this increase is dependent on the presence of s (a transcription regulator encoded by the rpoS gene). UPEC causes urinary tract infections (UTIs), reported to afflict astronauts; Gm is a standard treatment, so these findings could impact astronaut health. Because LSMMG findings can differ from MG, we report preparations to examine UPEC’s Gm sensitivity during spaceflight using the E. coli Anti-Microbial Satellite (EcAMSat) on a free-flying “nanosatellite” in low Earth orbit. Within EcAMSat’s payload, a 48-microwell fluidic card contains and supports study of bacterial cultures at constant temperature; optical absorbance changes in cell suspensions were made at three wavelengths for each microwell and a fluid-delivery system provided growth medium and predefined Gm concentrations. Performance characterization is reported here for spaceflight prototypes of this payload system. Using conventional microtiter plates, we show that Alamar Blue (AB) absorbance changes can assess the Gm effect on E. coli viability, permitting telemetric transfer of the spaceflight data to Earth. Laboratory results using payload prototypes are consistent with wellplate and flask findings of differential sensitivity of UPEC and its delta rpoS strain to Gm. if (sigma)s plays the same role in space MG as in LSMMG and Earth gravity, countermeasures discovered in recent Earth studies (aimed at weakening the UPEC antioxidant defense) to control UPEC infections would prove useful also in space flights. Further, EcAMSat results should clarify inconsistencies from previous space experiments on bacterial antibiotic sensitivity and other issues.” The manuscript may be consulted for further details and all the relevant references; see Bibliography section in 2017 report.\nIn addition, the work has brought to light issues, such as the stress exerted by the flight equipment on bacteria, which we are now in the process of elucidating and ameliorating for the development of better future platforms for spaceflight experimentation on bacterial biology, resistance, and virulence.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is becoming an extremely serious problem on Earth that impacts space travelers harder given the deleterious effect of microgravity on human immune response. The research has confirmed the hypothesis that underpinned it, and has shown the way to enhance effectiveness of antibiotics in general. Subsequent work, which is in progress, has identified compounds whose co-administration with antibiotics will enhance their curative power; these can also permit lowering the needed amount of antibiotics for treating infections, thereby minimizing their side effects. This promises to improve life in space as well as on Earth."

            "task_progress": "The spaceflight took place onboard a free-flying “nanosatellite,” which, for the first time utilized a 6-U configuration (a “U” being a 10-cm cube). The experiments were conducted on the EcAMSat hardware platform that we developed and described previously in the task book reports. Cell viability in this platform was measured by changes in the absorption of the dye Alamar Blue (AB); these were telemetered to Earth and recorded by daily communications with the spacecraft at Santa Clara University. Parallel ground controls were run. The flight performed very smoothly and all the needed data were successfully obtained. The major conclusion from the results is that the gene rpoS continues to play a critical role in making urinary pathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) highly resistant to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm). This antibiotic is used to treat urinary tract infections often reported in astronauts. Therefore, the potential small molecule inhibitors that we have identified (using bioinformatics approaches) of the protein encoded by rpoS and the antioxidant proteins it controls hold the promise to promote astronaut health in spaceflights. That these molecules are valuable also in meeting the rampant bacterial antibiotic resistance on Earth has been pointed out before.\nA second important finding is that the high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs) used to simulate microgravity on Earth did indeed provide correct information of UPEC biology in this respect because it is with the use of this system that we had first discovered the rpoS role in Gm resistance. The cumulative work on this grant earned the entire EcAMSat team individual NASA awards.\nThe publication  concerning this work will be submitted within the coming weeks.",

            "task_description": "Astronauts exposed to extended periods of unloading experience significant bone loss. As NASA undertakes an exploration initiative involving long-duration spaceflight and exploration of asteroids and Mars, astronauts will encounter prolonged periods of unloading followed by subsequent extra-vehicular activities in a gravity environment. Loss of bone mass and strength will complicate these activities and impair mission efficiency. For instance, considering the magnitude of bone loss occurring during spaceflight (0.5-1.5% loss of bone mineral density (BMD)/month), a fall on an already weakened skeletal system could result in fracture. Therefore, development of countermeasures for microgravity-induced bone loss is critical. We previously demonstrated that osteoblast- and osteocyte-specific deficiency in the gap junctional protein connexin 43 (Cx43) is protective against bone loss induced by unloading via hindlimb suspension (HLS). However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Osteocytes are well situated in bone to detect and communicate mechanical signals to effector cells and therefore play a pivotal role in bone's ability to sense and respond to unloading from exposure to microgravity. Therefore, we will examine the hypothesis that Cx43 deficiency attenuates the response of osteocytes to unloading resulting from simulated microgravity. Additionally, we will examine whether the response of osteocytes exposed to simulated microgravity in vitro can predict bone response to simulated microgravity in vivo. Using an in vivo and in vitro model, we will complete the following two aims.\nAim 1: Examine the response of wild-type and Cx43-deficient (via CRISPR gene editing) murine osteocytes (OCY454) to simulated microgravity in vitro using a High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV).\nAim 2: Examine the effect of simulated microgravity in vivo on bones from osteocyte-specific Cx43-deficient mice. Cx43 will be selectively deleted from mice using a Cre recombinase approach similar to what we previously used to delete Cx43 from osteoblasts and osteocytes.\nUsing well-established experimental paradigms like the HARV apparatus and HLS greatly increases the probability of successfully completing our aims and attaining important, novel findings. Collectively, our infrastructure and expertise, in combination with multiple unique reagents, place us in an unparalleled position to rapidly and significantly advance knowledge pertaining to the mechanisms underlying microgravity-induced bone loss. These aims and the experiments designed therein represent a substantive departure from our current understanding and will reveal novel targets for countermeasures.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The proposed research will establish the mechanism underlying the protective effect of Cx43 against microgravity-induced bone loss. This will help fill gaps in our understanding of gravity-sensing mechanisms. We will also gain insight as to whether in vitro models of microgravity, such as culturing cells in a HARV apparatus, induce similar changes in osteocytic gene expression as do in vivo models such as HLS. From the perspective of microgravity countermeasures, this information will guide the choice of potential therapeutics.\nOn the ground, concomitant bone loss is frequently experienced by individuals confined to bed for long durations, whether as a result of neurological injury, trauma, or neuromuscular disease (e.g., cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy). In these patients, and in healthy patients subjected to extended bed rest, a significant loss of bone occurs. In the case of recoverable disease or when ambulation is still possible, this leaves patients at risk for falls and catastrophic fracture. Understanding the mechanisms involved in bone loss during spaceflight, and the development of countermeasure strategies, will provide a framework for the development of preventative treatments for astronauts and the clinical population.\nThe proposed research is innovative because it provides the first simultaneous examination of effects of simulated microgravity on genetically modified osteocytes in vivo and in vitro.  A few studies have examined the effects of simulated microgravity on bone in vivo and in vitro,but no study has compared the effects of simulated microgravity on osteocytes or genetically modified mice in vivo and in vitro in the same study. Osteocytes play a key role in bone’s mechanosensitivity and adaptation to changes in mechanical loading. Furthermore, we are investigating the novel concept that Cx43 deficiency protects against microgravity-induced bone loss through a non-canonical mechanism involving an interaction between Cx43 and the WNT/ß-catenin pathway. Finally, we will use innovative transcriptomic approaches to compare the response of primary osteocytes exposed to simulated microgravity in vivo to osteocytic OCY454 cells exposed to simulated microgravity in vitro. In this proposal we are leveraging our experience and expertise in bone biology (Donahue) and gene expression (Buck). Our team brings forward a collaborative and unique skill set in order to ensure a complete and comprehensive investigation of the response of osteocytic cells to simulated microgravity."

            "task_description": "Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent \"omics\" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This proposal aims to gain a better mechanistic understanding of how plant roots function at the cellular and molecular levels. A primary focus of the proposed work is to ask how the microgravity environment modulates the directionality of root growth. Because roots are essential for the uptake of water and nutrients, knowledge gained from successful implementation of the proposed work will be crucial in guiding pre-breeding efforts aimed toward the development of crops with improved productivity through better and more efficient root systems. Thus, agriculture on Earth is one beneficial outcome of this project.\nInnovative technologies developed through this grant include lines of new model plants such as barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) and purple false brome (Brachypodium distachyon) expressing genetically-encoded sensors to the cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic calcium. We expect that these new plant lines will significantly advance basic plant biology research on Earth."

            "task_progress": "Although progress was made on all 3 specific aims of this proposal, it was limited because of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and closure of the PI's laboratory at the Noble Research Institute. Below we summarize progress for each aim.\nFor aim 1, most of our progress was made on processing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings for immunocytochemistry. Because we were not able to travel to the Microgravity Simulation Support Facility (MSSF) at the Kennedy Space Center in 2020, we focused our work activities in this aim using a custom-made 2D clinostat. Four-day old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the light and dark were mounted on the clinostat, and rotated in an axial direction for 2-weeks. Corresponding 1-g controls were included in the experiment. A 2-week clinorotation regimen was selected to approximately mirror the period of time seedlings in our previous Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) BRIC-16 and Advanced Plant Experiments (APEX) APEX-03-1 experiments were exposed to microgravity on the space shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), respectively. Each treatment condition had four 10 cm x 10 cm square Petri dishes. After 2 weeks of growth, at least 5 seedlings for each condition (i.e., clinorotated and 1-g controls) were preserved in an aldehyde solution and processed for flat embedded in LR White resin. The remaining seedlings were kept in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Because of the closure of the PI’s lab at Noble, embedded and PBS-stored samples were shipped to the laboratory of Dr. Simon Gilroy (University of Wisconsin). Future studies in the Gilroy lab upon transfer of the grant will involve sectioning the embedded seedlings and subsequent immunocytochemistry of selected non-cellulosic cell wall components.\nFor specific aim 2, we have  successfully generated lines of Brachypodium distachyon (a model grass) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged microtubule and actin reporters. We expect that these live cell cytoskeletal reporters in a model grass species will advanced studies of grass cell biology. Through past and current NASA support, we have now generated plant lines in Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Brachypodium distachyon expressing live cell microtubule and actin reporters. All these lines have been sent to the Gilroy lab in Wisconsin for use in future studies of microgravity- and clinorotated-induced changes in the cytoskeleton.\nMost of our progress for aim 3 has been on characterizing  actin cytoskeletal-related mutants that we isolated from previous NASA-funded research (APEX 03-1). Two peer-reviewed articles relevant to this aim were published during this reporting period. One noteworthy accomplishment during this reporting period was completing detailed cell biological studies on the recessive Arabidopsis thaliana hypersensitive to LatB2 (hlb2) mutant. Through map-based cloning, we found that the mutation in hlb2 had a 10 base pair deletion in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene.  AT1G03060 encodes a protein called SPIRRIG (SPI), a 3,571 amino acid long protein with N-terminally located armadillo (ARM) and concanavalin A (ConA)-like lectin domains and C-terminally-located pleckstrin homology (PH), beige and Chediak Higashi (BEACH) and WD40 repeat domains. BEACH domain-containing proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are known to function in membrane dynamics, vesicle transport, apoptosis and receptor signaling.\nIn a recent paper published in The Plant Cell, we studied root hair development in the hlb2/spi mutant. Root hairs are tip growing cells (i.e., cell expansion is confined to the apical-most domain of the cell) that extend the effective radius of a root to enable plants to optimize water and nutrient absorption. In previous spaceflight studies, we found that root hair development is impaired in microgravity. Root hair development is a complex process that involves the actin cytoskeleton and a multitude of proteins that specify the position of root hair emergence, and drive tip-focused growth. To gain an in-depth understanding of the role of actin during root hair development, it is important to be able to visualize the dynamics of proteins that may directly or indirectly modulate actin organization during this process. Visualizing protein dynamics in living cells is typically accomplished by tagging with a fluorescent protein such as GFP. However, some proteins that modulate root hair development are large and of low abundance, and therefore more challenging to analyze when tagged with fluorescent proteins. SPI is one such protein as it is 3,571 amino acids long. In the absence of SPI, root hair tip growth and the position of root hair emergence is stunted suggesting that this protein is a major modulator of root hair development.\nIn the aforementioned Plant Cell publication, we generated a fully functional fluorescent protein for SPI using a technique called recombineering in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. Expressing the SPI protein fusion in the hlb2/spi mutant drove normal root hair development and localized to the tip-most domain of rapidly elongating root hairs. The root hair tip localization of SPI was correlated with tip-focused filamentous-actin (F-actin) meshwork . Our work also revealed a link between SPI and selected components of the actin nucleating promoting complex WAVE/SCAR (W/SCR). For example, a fully functional BRICK1 (BRK1) fluorescent protein fusion (BRK1-mRuby3), a subunit of W/SCR, marked the position of root hair emergence. Live cell microscopy of BRK1-YFP and SPI-YPet revealed contrasting spatial and temporal dynamics, with the former intensifying and the latter dissipating as root hairs elongated. To observe BRK1 and SPI simultaneously within the same root hair, we generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and BRK1-mRuby3. BRK1-mRuby3 labeled the site in which a new root hair emerged and dissipated as the root hair bulge expanded. Within the same root hair cell, SPI-YPet fluorescence at the tip intensified as BRK1-mRuby3 dissipated. The weakening of BRK1-mRuby3 fluorescence coinciding with SPI-YPet accumulation provides indirect evidence that SPI might play a role in mediating BRK1 stability or localized clustering at the plasma membrane at the position of root hair emergence. Although it is unknown why BRK1-YFP signal persists in spi, we speculate that SPI might modulate BRK1 via protein degradation pathways .Our work on HLB2/SPI provides new insights that contribute to our understanding of actin-mediated root hair development, and point to potential functional relationships among HLB2/SPI and actin nucleation proteins during root hair development. For the future, we plan to evaluate genetic interactions between SPI and components of actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3)-W/SCR complex.\nThe live cell actin reporters we generated through NASA funding has also resulted in productive research collaborations with external Institutions. One noteworthy collaboration that made extensive use of our live cell actin reporters was with the group of Dr. Yangdou Wei at the University of Saskachewan, Canada. Using Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing the GFP-ABD2-GFP live cell actin reporter,  new details on how plants defend themselves against the powdery mildew fungal pathogen was discovered. It was shown that one of the earliest responses of plants to powdery mildew was the formation of actin patches beneath the fungal invasion sites. The assembly of this actin patch is facilitated by the ARP2/3-W/SCR complex and another actin nucleating protein called formin.\nNOTE: The PI (Blancaflor) and Co-I (Nakashima) ended their employment at the Noble Research Institute in March and May, respectively, as a result of the Noble decision to terminate basic plant science research. Therefore, on March 2021, a request was made to NASA to transfer remaining work on this grant to Dr. Simon Gilroy at the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Gilroy will be new PI for this work.",

            "task_description": "Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.\nPlants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development, and reduces yield.\nIn animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).\nIn all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast (8-10) and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.\nWe believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.\nWe also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.\nWe also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.\nIn conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.\nREFERENCES\n1.

These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to a variety of plant cellular stress responses. We successfully completed both of the preflight tests (science verification test (SVT) and experiment verification test (EVT)) to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the plant samples returned from BRIC-22. On August 14, 2017 our experiment was launched on board the SpaceX-12 ISS resupply mission and was successfully executed by ISS astronauts. The samples were preserved on orbit and underwent atmospheric reentry on board the same Dragon capsule in September of 2017. At the same time a duplicate of the experiment was grown at the Kennedy Space Center using temperature conditions which were matched to the flight conditions. We extracted RNA from both sets of samples and performed RNA sequencing in order to better understand what genes would be turned on and off specifically by spaceflight conditions in wild type plants and our mutant plants. We observed changes in the way that thousands of genes were activated in response to these conditions between flight and ground conditions and are submitting our results for peer review.\nMeanwhile, further research on these stress regulating genes and the Arabidopsis mutants that were tested in BRIC-22 is also being completed in continuing ground-based studies. Through a better understanding of these gene’s function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses.",

NOTE 12/11/2017: Continuation of \"Novel Explorations Into the Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--NNX12AO65G,\" per PI move from University of Mississippi to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.]\nThe major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.\nThese experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will be launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.\nA significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Studying the effects of gravity and light on basic cellular mechanisms in plants, this project is relevant to the emphasis on using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system in developmental biology. Since plants will be a necessary part of bioregenerative life support needed to send humans to Mars and beyond, the knowledge obtained from our spaceflight experiments will be critical for developing ways to effectively use plants in the bioregenerative life support systems. These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth."

            "task_description": "This project brings established research from NASA funded science on the International Space Station (ISS) into an international project led by DLR (German Space Agency) toward the functionalization of plant growth in support of human exploration. Imaging technologies developed as part of ongoing ISS science will be deployed within the Antarctic EDEN ISS plant production unit to provide tele-science support and plant science analytics to better understand the responses of plants, and production support to optimize plant performance.\nPlant production for advanced life support within deep space and extraterrestrial colonies has long been an appreciated area of technology development. Indeed ISS science is now turning toward small scale plant production in space, and plant production units in extreme environments on Earth have proven the value of fresh food. However, there has as yet to be any integrated tests of plant production within space vehicle-like structures in extreme analog environments. To address this gap in knowledge, the EDEN ISS project by the DLR German space agency is designed to place an ISS-inspired module in the context of an established Antarctic station, drawing together for the first time structures and production units designed to space vehicle formats together with the challenges of an extreme and isolated environment. In keeping with the spirit and intent of the EDEN ISS project, the current proposal seeks to fund US participation, bringing plant imaging technologies developed, in part from extensive Shuttle and ISS plant growth experiments, into the science to be conducted within EDEN ISS. The area of fidelity to be addressed by this project is a series of science investigations designed to further planetary research in terrestrial extreme environments that may be analogous to those found on other planets.\nThe EDEN ISS project is constructing essential controlled environment agriculture technologies using both an International Standard Payload Rack cultivation system to relate to on-board ISS and cis-lunar deployments for crew food supplementation, and a Future Exploration Greenhouse that is designed with respect to future planetary bioregenerative life support system deployments. The overall physical facility, referred to as the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility, will provide realistic mass flow and will deploy to the highly-isolated Antarctic Neumayer Station III, operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute.\nAmong the technologies to be developed and deployed will be imagers designed by the University of Florida (UF) Principal Investigator (PI) team, through this proposed project, to monitor plant health within the Mobile Test Facility. Our major goal is to equip the plant growth systems with information-rich imaging such that plant health and basic science data can be reviewed by a large and integrated science backroom back on “Earth.” An additional goal is to optimize the conceptual connections between EDEN ISS and current ISS capabilities and operations. These two goals bring a directed focus to the project, connecting the planetary surface analog concepts to near term operations of ISS and potential cis-lunar habitats.\nTo accomplish these goals, spectral imaging of plants will be incorporated into typical data monitoring systems and operation of the project. EDEN ISS, as a large multinational project, has an extensive Data Management Plan (DMP). The work proposed here will depend and draw upon the EDEN ISS DMP for the overall project data, and will specifically draw Mobile Test Facility (MTF) plant growth images and operations images as primary data for analysis and management by the UF team. The UF team will archive and make available all plant health images specific to our tasks via a separate project within the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). The technology is based on small, robust cameras that image wavelengths related to previous and future ISS hardware such that data from EDEN ISS will provide feed forward science for known and anticipated ISS and habitat plant growth hardware.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Exploration mission scenarios are increasingly engaging plant production as adjunct or major parts of life support. This is especially true for deep space and extraterrestrial surface scenarios, and there have been several lower fidelity projects that include plant production in analog tests of such scenarios. Plant growth has been a part of some simulations, and small-scale production type plant growth units are currently on the ISS. However, in none of these cases has an exploration-realistic plant growth facility been incorporated into a challenging analog site such as Antarctica to move the technology significantly toward anticipated mission structures and operations. And none incorporated sophisticated plant imaging into remote science backrooms. The EDEN ISS project is envisioned to fill that large gap, placing an ISS-inspired module near the German Antarctic Neumayer Station III. The EDEN ISS project is an active, funded project that involves a wide international team and is led by the German Aerospace Center, DLR. We have been invited to contribute our presence, expertise, and imaging technology to EDEN ISS. Opportunities for non-European participation at Neumayer III are rare, and EDEN ISS is unique in its magnitude and fidelity. This proposal seeks to seize the opportunity for important imaging technology advancement and US participation within the multinational context of the EDEN ISS project.\nThe EDEN ISS project seeks to create a structurally and operationally realistic analog to a space station, vehicular, or planetary habitat plant growth module for life support. As such, the project falls under the purview of Space Exploration and Spaceport Technology Development (SESTD) in several subcategories: In-Situ Resource Utilization Technologies (in that EDEN is dedicated to local production of food for bioregenerative Advanced Life Support), Lunar and Mars Base/Settlement Technologies (in that we will be within a robust simulation of life support technologies), and also Advanced Sensors and Detectors (in that we will be developing imaging cameras for monitoring plant health within the facility). As a working production facility, EDEN ISS will provide fresh produce to Neumayer III overwintering crews. And in the process, the project will validate key plant growth system technologies and operational protocols for use on the ISS and within future planetary bioregenerative life support systems -- a key set of technologies for long duration spaceflight and planetary habitation.\nThe project also has the potential to substantially contribute to plant health monitoring technology in terrestrial environments. Protected agriculture (production greenhouses and other crop facilities that are environmentally controlled or where climate is ameliorated) is a rapidly growing field in a world with expanding needs for food, and expanding regions of marginal crop land. Robotic tending and monitoring approaches are being embraced as time and resources saving tactics, and the type of health monitoring we are employing at EDEN ISS will contribute to the sophisticated tool box being employed in this expanding technology."

            "task_progress": "ISS Synthetic Experiment\nFollowing work done with James Goodman of HySpeed Computing.   Demonstration of Onboard Image-Based Plant Health Monitoring using ENVI in Space\nDeveloping automated systems for managing plant cultivation are important for the success of long-duration space missions. Towards that objective, we are utilizing the compute capabilities of the ENVI in Space mission to demonstrate a methodology for image-based monitoring of plant health on the International Space Station (ISS). ENVI in Space has deployed a full enterprise version of the industry leading image processing and analysis software ENVI® on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Spaceborne Computer-2 (SBC-2), which is located on the ISS. SBC-2 is the first commercial off-the-shelf high performance edge computing system with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities built for in-space data processing. Through this system, ENVI is being used to illustrate the advantages of onboard computing for an array of imaging applications, from Earth observation to space exploration. Here we are utilizing multispectral timeseries of plant images from the EDEN-ISS project and other controlled laboratory experiments to showcase image analysis capabilities for automated monitoring of plant health. This includes a full data processing workflow, from data ingest and pre-processing to spectral computations and statistical analysis. Results are generated in a user-friendly format to simplify interpretation and streamline future implementation as an automated plant management tool.\nMultispectral and AI integration\nWork done in conjunction with Dr. Sanjeev Koppal and Ms. Anna Hampton.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown exceptional performance in exploiting spatial relationships in image data. Given that the key indications of saline induced stress in our sample is loss of turgor pressure and leaf shrinkage, we have chosen to employ a CNN to extract feature maps. Following the convolutional layers, the features are linearized and passed through fully connected layers with the final layer producing the predicted time since stress. As far as image preprocessing, images were broken down into the four quadrants that correspond to the 4 plates. Labels for each quadrant image were generated based on time since stress exposure. The images pre-stress (or within the buffer times) and the control quadrant images are assigned a label of 0. A buffer region post application of saline is being used to ensure we have sufficient time for stress to set in before we assign a label indicating stress is present. We are experimenting with two different types of labeling, one with basic time since stress and one with exponentiated time since stress. The exponentiated time since stress is being tested because the network may learn better if there is a larger distinction between stress and non-stress images.\nProject Summary (Ed., November 27, 2022)\nThe spectral imaging project has moved forward the understanding of a deployable Plant Health Monitoring system for future off-Earth applications. The ability to build, calibrate and deploy an imager system, that cannot only detect early signs of stress in a plant, but that can also facilitate and early response will be important as enclosed life support systems become commonplace in off-Earth environments. The addition of potential on board processing and AI image analysis will continue to improve the future of plant heath detection systems in the future.",

            "task_description": "The spaceflight environment influences immune cell distribution, ex vivo responses to antigen, and cytokine expression. However, few studies have characterized the impact of the spaceflight environment on the host immune response following an in vivo immune challenge, particularly those involving B cells and antibody production. The International Space Station (ISS) provides an ideal laboratory within which investigators can explore this unique environment and its impact on the host response. Through the use of a mouse model (with an immune system that closely parallels that of humans), we will establish a link between exposure to the spaceflight environment and decrements in immune system activation. This study is significant because it will directly test the hypothesis that host immunological health will be compromised in space.\nOn-orbit Flight Activities, Procedures, and Timeline\nMice will receive health checks upon unloading and transfer from the Transporter to the Habitat after capsule docking no later than 24 hrs after hatch opening. Animal health will then be monitored daily via continuous video recording from one camera at a time from all of the Habitats on-orbit (including other investigations which may be running concurrently) and down-linked to Ames science staff. Ground personnel shall have the option of programming or manually controlling which camera is being down-linked and recorded at any given time. Water levels will be checked every 3-4 days. After a minimum of 14 days after animal transfer from the Transporter to the Habitat, all 20 mice will be moved to the MSG and receive intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of vehicle (5 mice), Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine (5 mice), CpG ODN adjuvant (5 mice), or TT vaccine + CpG ODN adjuvant (5 mice). The dose of TT and/or CpG ODN will be 10 microg/ mouse and 40 microg/ mouse, respectively.  Pre-mixed doses will be prepared preflight in 100 microl saline and stored at -20 to -30°C until the appropriate time point. All injections and blood draws will use a 1 mL 26G 3/8” tuberculin syringe.  All injections will be i.p.\nBefore use, the CpG adjuvant must be stored at -20°C or colder until use and the TT vaccine must be stored at 4°C. At 14 +/- 2 days after injection, mice will be transferred to the MSG and sacrificed via an i.p. injection of 100/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine mixture, followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately following the blood collection, the spleens from the mice will be removed, sectioned into halves, and placed in a frozen environment (minimum temperature -80°C) until returned to Earth. Following spleen collection, the remains of the mouse carcass will be wrapped in tin foil, put in a zip-lock bags and placed in a -80°C environment (or colder) to preserve the tissues for future biospecimen sharing. Blood must not be allowed to sit at ambient temperature for longer than 1 hour post-collection; if operational requirements require the blood collected to be stored in excess of 1 hour before centrifugation, the blood must be transferred to a 4°C environment until centrifugation, for a period not to exceed 4 hours. Blood collected will be separated into solid and serum/plasma fractions by centrifugation and frozen at -80°C until returned to Earth. Storage times for both spleen and blood of up to 6 months at -80°C are acceptable.\nTime\nActivity &\nEstimated Time Required\nThermal Req.\nComments, Location &\nSpecial Considerations\nLaunch to L + 45 days\nAnimal health checks via video monitoring; water    level checks every 3-4 days\n20 – 30°C\nVideo downlink required for health checks\nTransfer to Habitat + 14 d\nAll 20 mice will be transferred to habitat\n20 – 30°C\nRequires transfer to and from Habitat with MTB;\nInjection + 14d +/- 2 d\nAt specific time points, all 20 mice will be    removed from AEM and given appropriate injection\n20 – 30°C / -80°C\nRequired transfer to MSG for injections\nDissection + 0 d\nMice euthanized, blood drawn and centrifuged and    spleen sectioned and frozen.

Habitats will be kept at a regular 12hr:12hr day:night light cycle to match the day/night programmed to be synchronous with the crew’s day/night cycle upon arrival. Water refill of habitats shall be performed. To prevent rodent food bars from becoming too hard or soiled, they will be replaced with a fresh food bar plate (from 4°C storage) at a time to not exceed 30 days after the introduction of mice to a Habitat.\nGround Activities Accompanying On-orbit Activities and Timeline\nGround controls will be run following spaceflight environmental parameters in orbital environmental simulator(s) (OES) chambers at KSC ACF. Delay between launch and start of environmental controls may be up to 8 days, depending on the logistics and capability of the telemetry system. Mice will be housed in flight Habitats with RFB diet and lixit water to match on-orbit groups. The operations done on ground will be conducted to match the same relative time points during the day/night cycle of the animals on-orbit, so that procedures on ground control mice are conducted at the same points in the animals’ circadian rhythm.\nEach experimental group for ground controls will be doubled to improve the statistical significance of the experiment with a total of 40 mice (4 groups of 10). Therefore, 2 Transporters will be required for the flight in orbital environmental simulator(s) (OES) that have been programmed with telemetry data from the flight. At the same relative time point (accounting for delay in starting ground controls after flight) the mice are transferred from the Transporter to the Habitat, the 40 ground control mice will be transferred from the 2 Transporters into 4 Habitats, and maintained in OES programmed with telemetry data from the ISS. OES shall be programmed to mimic the following conditions experienced by the Transport and then the Habitat: CO2, O2, temperature, and humidity.\nInjection and dissection must be performed as close as possible to how they are done on-orbit. In particular, the time of day that mice are sacrificed and dissected on the ground should match the same point in the circadian rhythms of the mice on-orbit. However, dissections or ground control mice can be conducted on standard laboratory benches/tables with chairs that are more ergonomic to the operators. For ground controls, dissection pins or needles may be used to pin down mice for dissection, as can spray bottles of wetting the mice before dissection. Flight hardware is required when it may affect the tissue dissection or preservation, such as having flight cold blocks in mini cold bags for tissue freezing.\nMice will receive health checks daily via video in the Habitat and water levels will be checked every 3-4 days. After a minimum of 14 days in the OES, all 40 mice will receive an i.p. injection of vehicle (10 mice), TT vaccine (10 mice), CpG adjuvant (10 mice), or TT vaccine + CpG adjuvant (10 mice). At 14 +/- 2 days after injection, mice will be sacrificed via an i.p. injection of 100/10 mg/kg ketamine/xylazine mixture, followed by exsanguination by cardiac puncture. Immediately following the blood collection, the spleens from the mice will be removed, sectioned into halves, and placed in a frozen environment (minimum temperature -80°C) until returned to Earth. Duration for which blood is stored at ambient or 4°C shall be matched as closely as possible to the timelines the same procedures will be performed on-orbit.

            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "According to the National Institute of Aging (NIA), “Life expectancy nearly doubled during the 20th century with a ten-fold increase in the number of Americans age 65 or older.”  Furthermore, “there are approximately 35 million Americans age 65 or older, and this number is expected to double in the next 25 years.” Consequently, there is a rapidly growing need to understand the mechanisms underlying age-associated illness. Indeed, in the last decade, research has repeatedly demonstrated an impact of aging on immune function. Low-grade increases in circulating inflammatory cytokine secretion are often associated with senescence. Furthermore, studies suggest that these disruptions are likely due to decrements in cellular repair mechanisms and/or increases in antigenic load. Given this disruption in immune function, it is perhaps not surprising that many of the diseases associated with aging — such as type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular disease — have strong inflammatory underpinnings.\nThere are strong indications that the physiological effects of spaceflight are also similar to those seen in senescence. For instance, evidence suggests that age-associated enhancements in inflammatory cytokines are linked to changes in adipose tissue and energy balance. Similar links between metabolism, adipose tissue, and inflammation have also been shown to manifest in astronauts and animal models after exposure to spaceflight.  We propose to use long-term exposure to the spaceflight environment to model the effects of aging on immune function. Although these initial studies involve mice, the next obvious step in this work will be to work directly with astronauts.  Because astronauts tend to be extremely healthy, these effects will not be influenced by confounding factors such as clinically relevant, age-related disease. Also, because the effects of spaceflight on immunity are temporary, generally returning to baseline levels post-flight, this will ultimately give us some insight into whether or not the effects of aging are, indeed, reversible.\nAlthough many different aspects of immune function are influenced by both aging and spaceflight, these experiments will focus on B cells and the generation of antibodies.  Specifically, we will use next generation RNA sequencing techniques to characterize the B cell Ig heavy chain in animals that are challenged with tetanus toxoid.  The Ig heavy chain is the component of antibodies responsible for identifying specific sections of the tetanus toxoid, thereby coordinating subsequent immune responses.  Comparisons will be made between the B cell repertoires generated on ISS and on Earth.  The changes in B cell Ig heavy chain usage will provide indications whether the spaceflight environment affects the B cells that respond to antigen.  This, in turn, will help us understand the impact of aging on B cell function.\nWe anticipate that we will obtain several data sets which have relevance to spaceflight and/or have general significance to understanding host immune responsiveness.  These data include:   1)\tData that show that spaceflight either maintains or alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts;     2)\tInformation that demonstrates how immunization with an immunogen, commonly used in human medicine, alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts in the absence of the spaceflight variable;    3)\tDeterminations how activation of B cells through Tlr9 receptors alters the basic distribution of B cells based on Igh transcripts.\nWe will ascertain if activation of B cells through Tlr9 receptors can reverse any impact that may occur during spaceflight."

            "task_progress": "Project History and Review of Specific Aims\nThis project was submitted and funded in response to the NASA Research Announcement NNH12ZTT001N: Research Opportunities in Space Biology. This multidisciplinary project was to include three independent investigators and two institutions (Loma Linda University/LLU and Kansas State University/KSU, in addition to NASA). Since then, due to a series of unpredictable events, this project has evolved to include a number of ground-based analog studies, multiple analyses of flight tissues, and an actual flight study. We designated this experiment as Tetanus Antibody Response from B-cells In Space (TARBIS).\nThe original project involved three different experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to characterize different aspects of the antibody response. We proposed to immunize mice with the established tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine. This would allow us to generate an antigen-specific antibody response in our mouse model while using a clinically-relevant antigen. Our goal was to determine the impact of the spaceflight environment on primary and secondary antibody responses. C57BL/6J mice were challenged with a TT vaccine either before launch or during their stay on the ISS, as appropriate. Blood and spleen were to be collected in orbit from mice 2 weeks after primary or secondary immunization. Vaccination and assessment schedules would have been matched in ground-based controls. The antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatment groups.\nDue to the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and a greater-than 2-year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved in 2015 to modify the aims of NNX13AN34G to include a Flight Definition Phase. Much of the work between 2015 and 2018 involved completing the Flight Definition phase work and publishing the results. In 2017-2018, we requested a funding augmentation and began preparations for our spaceflight mission. As this process evolved, two of our originally proposed experiments were combined into one flight experiment. During this period a Co-Investigator, Dr. Keith Chapes, announced that he would be retiring from KSU. With his retirement, all experimental operations were moved to LLU. Previously, this work was completed at KSU in Dr. Chapes’ lab. Dr. Chapes continued his role as a Co-I as an independent consultant. In 2019, this experiment flew as TARBIS/Rodent Research-12. In the years between 2019 and the present, we were involved with a number of other flight-related opportunities, including several Biospecimen Sharing Program dissections and RR-18.  Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted and delayed multiple activities during this period.     Flight Definition Phase Work\n1. Analysis of spleen tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research - 1 (RR-1) verification flight.\nWe analyzed spleen RNA from these tissues (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 ground controls). We have determined IgH usage of the spleen B cells in these mice (flight vs. ground controls). We also generated total RNASeq on the RNA to have a matching data set to the liver RNASeq that is being done by the NASA GeneLab.\nWe analyzed GeneLab sequencing data that was available from the GeneLab database (GLDS-47, GLDS-48). The number of immunoglobulin reads (either heavy or light chain) were quite low, less than 1% of what we had obtained in preliminary analysis of spleen cells and tissue. We first attributed this low yield to short sequencing reads from the HiSeq sequencing method that Genelab did and provided in the database. Therefore, we sequenced both splenic (funded by another grant) and liver RNA from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) validation flight, which was made available by the NASA Ames Research Center (n=3 ground, n=3 flight). RNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (300bp, 2x) at the Kansas State Integrated Genomics Facility. Sequencing data was quality trimmed using CLC Genomics Workbench and mapped to reference libraries obtained from the  ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database. Data sets were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for Complementarity Determining Region 3 (CDR3) characterization.\nThe analysis of liver (quantified as part of the tissue sharing grant, NNX15AB45G) vs. spleen (quantified as part of THIS grant) reads indicated that liver immunoglobulin gene reads range from 0.26% of spleen immunoglobulin gene reads to 0.91%. The number of reads ranges from less than 100 to no greater than 622, depending on the sample. Although useful, publishable data from the spleen can be obtained (preliminary data presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) and presented in the GeneLab workshop by Chapes and Ward), the liver sequencing will not provide meaningful immunoglobulin gene data, even when the more comprehensive MiSeq next generation sequencing (NGS) platform is used to sequence. The liver data won’t be of any value and will not fulfill our goal of doing tissue comparisons. Other data from the MiSeq NGS data sets will be useful for other data mining attempts and will be made available to the GeneLab. Therefore, these sequencing runs allowed us to narrow our focus and not waste time on liver analyses. [Ed. Note: For information on the tissue sharing grant, see NASA Grant # NNX15AB45G; PI: Chapes. For ASGSR and other References, see the Cumulative Bibliography for this project.]\n2. An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight.\nIn this protocol, mice were subjected to AOS. Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways: phosphate buffer saline (PBS), unmethylated cytosine–guanine dinucleotide motifs (CpG), tetanus toxoid (TT), and TT with CpG. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we sacrificed the mice and collected a variety of tissues for further analysis. These are the same treatment groups that were proposed for our ISS studies. We used female C57BL/6J mice, 10-12 weeks old at the start of unloading. Independent variables were Tetanus Toxoid, CpG adjuvant, and hindlimb unloading. Blood and spleen were analyzed as part of this grant (NNX13AN34G). Assays at Loma Linda University included blood, TT specific IgG, IgA, IgM, and non-specific Ig levels. Kansas State University completed analyzing the IgH & IgK repertoire based on RNAseq.\nThe AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during spaceflight (Chapes, Mastro et al. 1993). [Ed. Note: See References.] Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 (5 mice per treatment group); Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 (5 mice per treatment group). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS. Two weeks later, the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways: PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG. Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we sacrificed the mice and collected a variety of tissues. This protocol was followed so that when mice were flown to the ISS, we would have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables. Serum, spleen, liver, and bone marrow were collected specifically to compare with our flight project.\nBriefly, we were able to confirm that i.p. injections – as opposed to the more typical intramuscular (i.m.) injection for vaccines – of TT resulted in an antibody response and that this response was augmented by an order of magnitude when mice were also given the CpG adjuvant. However, AOS had little impact on the ability to generate TT-specific antibodies, at least in the blood. AOS increased circulating corticosterone levels and a number of cytokines/chemokines, including GCSF, IL-1a, IL-5, IL-6, IP-10, and KC.\nImpact of AOS on the Spleen Ig Repertoire\nWe explored the impact of skeletal unloading using the AOS model and mice were experimentally challenged with TT and/or the adjuvant CpG. AOS did alter constant gene usage, resulting in higher levels of IgM and lower levels of IgG. CpG also altered constant gene region usage, increasing usage of IgA. Significant changes could be detected in multiple V-, D-, and J-gene segments in both the heavy and light chains in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatments. Analysis of class-switched-only transcripts revealed a different pattern of V-gene segment usage than detected in the whole repertoire and also showed significant alterations in gene segment usage after challenge. Alterations in V/J pairing were also detected in response to challenge. CDR3 amino acid sequence overlaps were similar among treatment groups, though the addition of CpG lowered overlap in the heavy chain. We isolated 3,045 whole repertoire and 98 potentially TT-specific CDR3 sequences for the heavy chain and 569 for the light chain. Our results demonstrate that AOS alters the repertoire response to challenge with TT and/or CpG.\nImpact of AOS on the Bone Marrow Ig Repertoire\nIn the same AOS experiment, the bone marrow antibody repertoire was characterized – including V-, D- (heavy only), and J-gene segment usage, constant region usage, CDR3 length, and V(D)J combinations. We detected changes in gene-segment usage in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatment in both the heavy and light chains of bone marrow B cells. Additionally, changes were seen in the class-switched VH-gene repertoire. Alterations were also detected in V/J pairing for both the heavy and light chains, and changes CDR3 length. We also detected lower levels of CDR3 AA overlap than detected in the splenic repertoire. These results demonstrate that AOS, TT, and CpG alter the bone marrow antibody repertoire; however, it is still unclear from both the spleen and the bone marrow data whether there is a loss of host antigen-specific responsiveness because of the change in gene use.\nMiSeq analysis of the spleen was completed at KSU. Originally, we had intended to perform a similar analysis of the liver. However, as described above, this analysis was ineffective and we opted to analyze bone marrow instead. In addition, we characterized changes in circulating corticosterone and found that AOS led to a significant increase. Furthermore, we noted a trend for the AOS response to be augmented in TT treated mice.\nAlthough the tissue analyses were slightly different from those described in the original proposal, the aim of doing multiple tissue assessments/comparisons was accomplished. This is a high-science return. We also believe that results from these studies will augment the data from the flight experiments, confirming the efficacy of AOS as a model for spaceflight for immune endpoints.\n3. NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Anti-orthostatic Suspension Experiment in Collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Blaber.\nDue to the nature of the studies described above, we were unable to use the blood or spleen tissue collected in the LLU experiments described above to characterize the impact of unloading on WBC populations. Furthermore, the funding and flight requirements for our flight project did not allow us to compare male vs. female mice. Fortuitously, the opportunity arose to look at blood populations in a study with a design similar to our own. This project involved Elizabeth Blaber, Ph.D. at Ames Research Center. [Ed. Note: See Space Biology projects under PI: Blaber in the NASA Task Book.]\nThe focus of Dr. Blaber’s study was to study the impact of p21 on bone, muscle, and stem cells. Male and female mice were suspended for 15 or 30 days (the latter timepoint is very similar to the 28 day unloading in our AOS studies). At the appropriate timepoint, mice were sacrificed and tissues were collected immediately. We characterized blood populations using an ABC Vet automatic hematology analyzer. In addition, we collected adrenals, brain, cerebellum, eye, liver, and skin tissue and froze them in liquid nitrogen. Although we were primarily interested in the wild type controls for this study, we collected tissues from both wild type controls and the p21 knockout mice.\nOur analyses of the blood indicated that unloading decreased all of the major leukocyte population counts. This decrease was generally more pronounced in the lymphocyte subset than in the other populations. Female mice tended to have higher cell counts than males, but there was no significant unloading x sex interaction on any subset. Finally, counts were similar between wild-type controls and p21 knockouts for all populations.\n4. Tetanus Toxoid Validation Test\nIn 2018, we were told that our flight experiment would be the focus of Rodent Research - 12 (RR-12). Because our initial assessment of the tetanus toxoid was several years old, we ran a small verification test on a new lot of the toxoid to ensure that biological activity of the vaccine would be as expected during the launch. This dose response study focused around the dose optimized in previous tests. Endpoints include TT-specific IgG levels. This experiment was performed in March of 2019. While we were able to verify that the same dose of TT could be use with in RR-12, we found that the CpG adjuvant was not as effective as in previous experiments.  As a consequence, we were approved to double the CpG dose as part of the flight experiment.\n5.  An Analysis of the Effects of Spaceflight and Vaccination on Antibody Repertoire Diversity\nAs part of this project, our group had the opportunity to examine the antibody repertories in C57Bl/6 mice after a number of different situations. These data allowed us a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that antibody diversity can be altered by physiological adaptation. That is, spaceflight, simulated spaceflight and/or immune responses are disruptions in stable environment and affect antibody diversity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed antibody diversity, as expressed by CDR3 amino acids, in four experiments and five data sets we have generated, using analyses frequently used to assess communities in ecological contexts; specifically, the Shannon Index (SI), an established measure of diversity. We discovered a trend towards lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in SI between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the antibody repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.\n6.  A Comparison of Unamplified and Massively Multiplexed Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Amplification for Murine Antibody Repertoire Sequencing\nWe started this project with the hypothesis that an unamplified Immunoglobulin gene data set would provide comparable results to those seen in the commercially amplified data sets. However, there were no immunoglobulin repertoire studies done to compare data obtained using amplification techniques compared to the repertoire in a total RNASeq library. Concurrent with performing these analyses, we discovered that the required sample preparation for commercial sequencing also varied. Therefore, we found it necessary to examine the impact of sample preparation as part of our effort. This preflight verification work compared a data set generated using unamplified total RNA (TRNA) to commercially amplified data sets. We examined the role of commercial amplification and cDNA generation methods, as well as the impact of the starting material on sequence output.  We found that sequencing of unamplified splenic RNA provides a realistic snapshot of the total splenic B cell repertoire. We also demonstrated that a good understanding of the bioinformatics workflow and reporting of the methodology is critical and cannot be understated. We established that there are cellular biases and transcript stability differences within B cell subpopulations. However, for the purpose of assessing a whole tissue B cell repertoire, unamplified RNASeq was capable of providing a valuable glimpse of the most prevalent B cell clones. Most importantly, an unamplified data set may detect V-gene segments that amplified data sets miss.\nFlight Activities\nOur flight investigation was launched on NG-11 out of NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility (Wallops) on 4/17/19. At the request of NASA, this flight experiment combined experiments 1 and 2 of our original proposal, including: 1) a primary challenge in space, and 2) a primary challenge pre-flight + a secondary challenge in space. Members of our team participated in the baseline, environmental control, and vivarium control vaccinations and tissue collection at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). All of these events were on a 3-4 day delay after similar procedures were performed by the ISS astronauts. Collected tissues for ground controls were frozen and shipped to LLU and stored in our freezers at -80°C. A subset of the flight blood and spleen samples were returned from the ISS and shipped to LLU to our lab in August 2019. The remaining samples and frozen carcasses of our flight mice were returned and shipped to LLU in January 2020.\nWe performed a tetanus toxoid specific IgG/IgA/IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on the blood samples from this study. There were some issues with the samples brought back from the ISS. Specifically, there was significant lysing of the red blood cells (RBCs) and we were unable to separate the cells from the plasma in roughly half of the cells. However, despite these difficulties, we were able to detect Ig in the appropriate samples.\nThe data suggest that both the CpG adjuvant and a secondary inoculation with the vaccine increased the antibody responses as expected on the ground. The difference in scale for the primary vs. secondary response figures indicates that under normal circumstances, B cell memory developed and responded as expected. However, both the primary and secondary responses were drastically inhibited after flight. There are several possible reasons for this. Decreases in the efficacy of 1) the adjuvant, 2) antigen presentation, 3) B cell memory development after the primary injection, or 4) overall cell death in B cell counts are all possibilities. The approval of our last flight experiment (where both the primary and secondary inoculations occur in orbit) is crucial to help identify the actual mechanism.\nSummary of Work: 2020 - 2021\nCOVID-19 Related Delays\nLoma Linda University went on COVID-related lockdown in March 2020. At that time, all staff were strongly encouraged to work from home if possible. Much of the work associated with this grant involved tissue processing and data analysis. While the data analysis could continue (we were able to get permission for our postdoc to connect remotely to our server), the tissue processing was put on hold. This coincided with a shutdown at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for both COVID-related issues and a temporary university-wide power failure that halted processing for several weeks.\nDue to the uncertainty related to COVID, both of our postdocs (Drs. Trisha Rettig and John Tan) opted to move on to other positions. Dr. Rettig left for a position in industry on 10/5/2020. Dr. Tan moved on to a faculty position within LLU on 6/30/2020. Similarly, our research technician, Nina Nishiyama, moved on to go to graduate school at the University of North Carolina on July 17, 2020.\nSummary of Work 2021 - 2023\nPersonnel Changes\nIn 2021, we requested an augmentation to continue the work on this project due to a variety of COVID-related delays and personnel changes. As part of this request, we included salary for half of a technician, a postdoc and a grad student. The funding was approved and the revised cooperative agreement was signed in December of 2021. For well over a year, we were unable to identify a grad student and post-doc to continue working on this project. This was likely due to 1) the difficulties associated with COVID, 2) the national downturn in grad school applications, and 3) the timing for the additional funding (i.e., in the middle of Loma Linda University’s academic year). We were finally able to identify both a grad student and post-doc at the end of 2022.  However, shortly thereafter, our grad student had to take a prolonged leave of absence due to health-related issues.  He returned to work in the summer of 2023.\nChanges in Antibody Repertoire Analysis\nAfter several delays and mishaps beyond our control, we had to make a change in our analysis, switching our antibody repertoire analysis away from the facility at Kansas State University and going with the company iRepertoire. For the first 4-5 months of 2022, we dealt with supply chain related delays trying to get the samples checked and prepped to send. We were finally able to send these tissues out to begin processing in the summer of 2022.\nTissue Collection with BSP\nFor about three weeks in October of 2021, personnel from the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) at NASA  Ames Research Center (Ames) traveled to Loma Linda University to help with the tissue collection from the RR-12/TARBIS mice (frozen in orbit at the time of the mission). This was originally supposed to happen back in 2019 but was delayed considerably for a variety of reasons, including COVID-related facility shutdowns. These tissues were either shipped to Ames and added to the BSP tissue archives or shipped to co-investigators for analysis.\nAdditional Opportunities in Collaboration with Dr. Xiao Wen “Vivian” Mao\nIn January-February of 2022, several members of the TARBIS team joined Dr. Xiao Wen Mao in support of her RR-18 Live Animal Return (LAR) tissue collection at the Roskamp Institute in Florida (NASA Grant #NNX15AB41G). Although Dr. Pecaut is a Co-investigator on Dr. Mao’s grant, he also collected additional tissues as part of the BSP (specifically, spleen). Because our RR-12/TARBIS tissues were collected and frozen in orbit, we were not able to perform any functional assays or flow cytometry-based phenotype analysis. Fortunately, Dr. Mao’s flight parameters were very similar to one of our RR-12 flight experiments (i.e., ~ 4 week flight time). Therefore, we used this opportunity to do phenotyping and cytokine expression to complement our antibody analysis from our previous flight. This also complements our ground-based centrifuge study (\"Spaceflight Impacts the Microbiome-Brain Axis\" or “SIMBA”, NASA Grant #: 80NSSC19K1038) which was also for 4 weeks. This analysis is ongoing.\nIn April-May of 2022, Dr. Mao’s second RR-18 dissection occurred. This study was designed to look at the recovery responses 2-3 months after landing. Although we do not have RR-12/TARBS data that would directly correspond with this recovery period, we felt knowing the phenotype distribution and cytokine responses would inform us of the long-term consequences of spaceflight on populations critical to the antibody response.\nCurrent Status\nThroughout the final months of this project, both our post-doc and graduate student have been working on analyzing the data generated by iRepertoire.  This analysis is ongoing even though the funds for this project have ceased.\nREFERENCES\nChapes SK, Mastro AM, Sonnenfeld G, Berry WD.

            "task_description": "The capability to grow nutritious, palatable food for crew consumption during spaceflight has the potential to provide health promoting, bioavailable nutrients, enhance the dietary experience, and reduce launch mass as we move toward longer-duration missions. However, studies of edible produce during spaceflight have been limited, leaving a significant knowledge gap in the methods required to grow safe, acceptable, nutritious crops for consumption in microgravity. The “Veggie” vegetable-production system on the International Space Station (ISS) offers an opportunity to develop a “pick-and-eat” fresh vegetable component to the ISS food system as a first step to bioregenerative supplemental food production. We propose growing salad plants in the Veggie unit during spaceflight, focusing on the impact of light quality and fertilizer formulation on crop morphology, edible biomass yield, microbial food safety, organoleptic acceptability, nutritional value, and behavioral health benefits of the fresh produce.

We are using the Veggie hardware to develop light and fertilizer combinations that generate nutritious and appealing leafy green vegetables and dwarf tomatoes that astronauts can safely consume.  The results of this research will directly translate to Earth-based controlled environment production of these and similar crops in vertical farms and urban plant factories.\nThe capability to grow nutritious, palatable food for crew consumption during spaceflight can potentially provide health-promoting, bioavailable nutrients, enhance the dietary experience, and reduce launch mass as we move toward longer-duration exploration missions. However, studies of edible produce during spaceflight have been limited, leaving a significant knowledge gap in the methods required to grow safe, acceptable, nutritious crops for consumption in microgravity. The Veggie vegetable-production system on the ISS offers an opportunity to develop a “pick-and-eat” fresh vegetable component to the ISS food system as a first step to bioregenerative supplemental food production. Our goal is to grow salad crops in the Veggie unit during spaceflight and assess the impact of light quality and fertilizer formulation on crop morphology, edible biomass yield, microbial food safety, organoleptic acceptability, nutritional value, and behavioral health benefits. Our work will help define light color ratios, fertilizer composition, and horticultural best practices to achieve high yields of safe, nutritious leafy greens and tomatoes to supplement a space diet of prepackaged food. Our final deliverable will be to develop growth protocols for these crops in a spaceflight vegetable-production system.  This will reduce the risk and close the gap of inadequate nutrition by helping us advance bioregenerative food production to supplement the packaged diet for future space exploration."

These experiments are sponsored by the Human Research Program but are implemented in partnership with the Space Biology Program.  The VEG-04 flight experiments were conducted in 2019, and the VEG-05 experiment was conducted on ISS Dec. 2022 through March 2023. Because of the delay, an additional component was added to this experiment, known as HRF VEG (which stands for Human Research Facility – Veggie). The HRF VEG experiment consists of collecting data-of-opportunity from other space biology investigations with plants that were conducted on the ISS between the VEG-04 and VEG-05 tests. Data collected are specific to the human research foci of this project and include only behavioral health and performance data with the Veggie Questionnaire and Profile of Mood States data collected and Organoleptic acceptability data on the crops.     I.\tUpdates   A.\tStudent Augmentation of Grant  A student augmentation grant titled “Pick-and-Eat Salad-Crop Nutrition & Next-Generation System Designs” was awarded by the Human Research Program to PhD student Jess Bunchek associated with this larger project. This augmentation enabled nutritional analysis of crop samples grown in the EDEN ISS plant production facility at the German Neumayer Station III in Antarctica and the aeroponic nutrient solutions with which the crops were grown. These data will provide a better understanding of crop nutrient composition across different plant production platforms and across a long-duration expedition in an isolated, confined, extreme environment that has similarities to a space mission. With this augmentation, Jess was able to attend the HRP Investigators Workshop and present “Nutrition of Antarctic-Grown Crops to Supplement the Crew Diet, with Applications for Spaceflight.” A manuscript highlighting this experimentation is expected in FY24.\nB.\tVEG-04A and B  VEG-04A was conducted during Increment 57-58 and ran from June 4, 2019-July 9, 2019.

In the Veggie unit, during spaceflight, salad plants will be grown, focusing on the impact of light quality and fertilizer formulation on crop morphology, edible biomass yield, microbial food safety, organoleptic acceptability, nutritional content, and behavioral health benefits of the fresh produce for the Solanum lycopersicum \"Red Robin\" dwarf Tomato cultivar. The VEG-05 experiment will test different red-to-blue light ratios using the Veggie units on the ISS. Tomato plants will be grown in Veggie for ~100 days and astronaut crewmembers will provide plant care and pollination, and harvest fruit 3 times during and at the end of this growth period. Crewmembers will be asked to complete self-report surveys, including the Profile of Mood States – Short Form (POMS-SF) and a Veggie-specific questionnaire pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. They will also be asked to perform an organoleptic evaluation of a portion of the fresh produce they consume at harvest.\nConsumed tomato samples will have their mass measured on ISS prior to crew consumption, and half of the produce will be frozen and returned to Earth for post-flight microbiological food safety and nutritional analysis. The goal of this experiment is to help define light colors and horticultural best practices to achieve high yields of safe, nutritious appealing tomato fruit to supplement a space diet of prepackaged food.\nVEG-05 Flight Operations  SpX-CRS-26 launched the VEG-05 payload on Nov. 26, 2022, and it docked on Nov. 27. Initiation of VEG-05 was started on 12/9/2022, but challenges led to subsequent initiation activities on 12/12/2022 and plant growth initiation on 12/14/2022, with the first ground control started 12/16/2022. This was later terminated due to poor germination and a second ground control was run 2/1/2023-05/12/2023. Both flight and ground control ran 100 days, with harvests of fruit at day 83, day 90, and day 100. In total, from the five surviving red-rich lighted plants in flight, only 5 ripe fruits were produced, and from the four surviving blue-rich lighted flight plants, 10 fruits were produced with only 6 of these ripe by day 100. A large number of photos and some video tours are part of the plant data collected. Due to the challenges with growth enumerated in the previous report, all planned activities were not accomplished. Human subject surveys were conducted but there were insufficient fruit samples for sensory evaluation. All fruit and plant samples were returned frozen at or below -80ºC. Plant samples included leaves and adventitious roots of surviving plants. Water samples were returned from root mat reservoirs, with the post-growth samples collected the day after harvest. Only a few swabs were taken from the flight Veggies from bungees only, due to harvest activities running over time. The planned samples from bellows and the Veggie fans were not collected. Pillows 1, 3, 7, and 10 were also collected and returned for analysis of roots, wicks, and substrates.\nBecause of the small sample sizes and factors affecting growth on the ISS, the objectives of assessing the light quality effect (red: blue light treatments) will not be fully achieved. Revised objectives of this study include comparing stressed flight plants with normal ground plants to determine the impact of plant overwatering stress in space on food safety and the plant microbial community, to determine nutrient content changes in fruit and leaves from stressed plants, and to evaluate stress metabolism changes in returned tissue by transcriptomic analysis. Postflight analysis was conducted with the following analyses being prioritized: A. culturable microbiology and food safety as well as molecular microbial community analysis of 1. ripe fruit; 2. leaves, stems, and adventitious roots; 3. pillow components (roots, wicks, and substrates); 4. swabs; and 5. water samples from root mats before and after growth. B. transcriptomics of leaf tissue and adventitious roots, and C. elemental analysis of leaf tissue.  Unfortunately, there was insufficient tissue to conduct the analyses of leaves; however, elemental analyses were performed on a few of the harvested fruit.\nMicrobial Analyses  Total Culturable Microorganisms were assessed with determinations of Aerobic Plate Counts (APC)/Bacteria and Total Yeast and Mold Count.  Specific pathogens were screened for including Generic E. coli/Coliforms using Petrifilm, Salmonella sp. using enrichment/selective media, and Staphylococcus aureus using Petrifilm. Any colonies that grew in these methods were isolated and identified using the Biolog MicroID system and MicroSEQ fungal and bacterial gene sequencing ID. Screening for selected pathogens yielded negative results and this was confirmed by community 16S and ITS sequencing.\nWe observed no difference between red-rich and blue-rich treatments in bacterial and fungal CFUs in-flight samples. The red-rich ground control surface swabs and adventitious roots had significantly lower bacterial counts than the blue-rich treatment, while the fungal counts were lower in the red-rich wicks, leaves, and adventitious roots. Blue-rich fruit samples, surface swabs and leaves were lower in the ground controls than in the flight samples for both bacteria and fungi.\nMolecular Analyses - Microbiome  Community sequencing was performed using the 16S rRNA gene for bacterial taxonomic identification with the QIIME 2.0 with Silva approach. ITS was used for fungal taxonomic identification using KRAKEN2 with the UNITE database.\nIf we look at a heat map of the total microbiome, we see differences between flight and ground, and we see that true roots (from plant pillows) and adventitious roots had higher community diversity than leaf or fruit samples. When we look at 16S details by sample we see Pseudomonas dominating many of the samples, and if we remove that we start to see different clustering appear.\nMolecular Analyses - Transcriptome  Transcriptomics of leaf and adventitious roots sampled was performed with the GeneLab RNA-Seq Consensus Pipeline-RCP. We looked at the percentage distribution of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in adventitious roots and leaves of ground and flight plants grown with either the red-rich or blue-rich lighting treatments and saw that leaf and root tissue in blue-rich lighting showed a higher percent of DEGs.\nWhen Principal Component Analyses (PCA) are performed on these data, we start to see leaf and root DEGs clustered based upon condition (flight versus ground) and gene expression completely separated based on tissue type, but there is overlap in both tissue types between flight and ground. If PCA plots are coded to differentially represent red-rich and blue-rich treatments, there is considerable overlap between ground and flight samples in red-rich treatments, but blue-rich samples segregate between these locations.\nWork is underway to interpret the differential gene expression observed in VEG-05. In leaves, there is strong differential regulation of genes in blue-rich grown samples in flight. Biological processes are identified, such as light-harvesting photosystem I, cell division, and protein regulation. There is a different group of upregulated genes in blue-rich grown ground control leaf samples with functions such as cell cycle regulation and protein biosynthesis being modified. In adventitious roots, we see some similar responses as in the leaf tissue including changes in photosynthesis, ATP energy production, and protein biosynthesis. This is not unexpected because the adventitious roots did contain some chlorophyll.\nIn the red-rich grown plant samples, there were fewer DEGs. For leaves, these involve respiration, mitochondria and energy production in the form of electron transport. In adventitious roots, DEGs are showing that these are responding to red-light differential regulation in photosynthesis and energy production, protein biosynthesis. When gene ontology is looked at, we start to see a broad categorization of the genes involved. For adventitious roots under the same conditions, we see similar responses to the leaves but also responses to stress, hydrogen peroxides catabolic processes or redox stress.\nOverall, there appear to be more DEGs in leaf and adventitious root samples in blue-rich light compared to red-rich light. A functional enrichment analysis of DEGs showed similarities between leaf and adventitious root samples, as expected. Some of the hallmarks of spaceflight were detected in flight samples including stress response, lignin, radiation stress, and hydrogen peroxide catabolic processes. Further analyses are underway, and two manuscripts on the VEG-05 plant data are being prepared. While not generating the desired information on spaceflight growth responses of healthy crops, our team is hopeful that these analyses will shed light on tomato responses to stress in this environment as plant overwatering stress is a mission-relevant condition that could occur in future space crop growth systems.\nBehavioral Health data from VEG-04, HRF VEG, and VEG-05  Plants as a Potential Spaceflight Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) Countermeasure  Plants are a potential countermeasure for the stresses of living in space. Caring for plants and eating fresh food have been shown to serve as a psychological benefit for previous astronauts and for others in analogous environments such as Antarctica (Schlacht et al., 2019, Vessel & Russo, 2015). Gardening can be therapeutic and has been used as such in terrestrial settings (Odeh & Guy, 2017). These effects may carry over or even be more pronounced in austere resource-limited environments such as spaceflight. It can reduce stress and increase sensory stimulation and enjoyment (Vessel & Russo, 2015). Growing crops for consumption may also offer astronauts a form of meaningful and engaging work as they care for living things in an austere environment away from Earth’s nature and as they provide sustenance for their crew. Additionally, fresh produce may enhance the diet and encourage consistent consumption by avoiding menu fatigue, which may further support psychological health and well-being by supporting a healthy brain and body (Douglas et al., 2022). Despite these potential benefits, difficulty in crop production and struggling or dying plants may reduce positive effects. The data on the psychological effects of growing crops in spaceflight is limited.\nAs such, we examined behavioral outcomes associated with tending to plants and consuming crops grown during long-duration missions. Here, we further characterized which aspects of horticulture are most salient and psychologically beneficial to astronaut health and well-being. We hypothesized that engaging with plants during a mission would have a beneficial effect as evidenced by reported positive mood and enhanced well-being, meaningfulness, connection to Earth, relationships, and performance. We also hypothesized that interacting with the plants would be a source of positive sensory stimulation for the crew. Preliminary in-flight data analysis results are described below. More comprehensive analyses are underway in preparation for the final report.\nMethods for the In-flight Phase for BHP Aims  Participants  Participants were 27 astronauts who interacted with the plant systems VEG-04, VEG-05, and HRF-VEG (Human Research Facility – Veggie). HRF-VEG data were collected from other space biology investigations of plants that were being conducted on the ISS between the VEG-04 and VEG-05 tests. HRF-VEG data included VEG-03 I, J, K, and L and PH-04. Total N sizes noted below vary by different plant activities, depending on what each astronaut may or may not have experienced during their mission. There was a total of 106 in-flight observations.     Measures  POMS-SF. The Profile of Mood States Short Form (Curran et al., 1995) was given to participants every three weeks around plant growth. Results forthcoming.  BHP Veggie Questionnaire. The Behavioral Health and Performance Veggie Questionnaire was given to participants monthly, beginning with plant growth initiation. Plant and crop growth experience items examined enjoyment and time spent performing specific activities with the plants; behavioral health outcomes such as engagement, demanding, meaningful, and effects on well-being, mood, performance, and relationships with others; connections to the Earth; desire to work with and eat plants; sensory stimulation for sight, smell, touch, and taste; human factor aspects of time, training, and supplies; and experiences with struggling or dying plants. Items were initially offered on a 201 or 101-point visual analog scale (VAS), with higher ends of the scale indicating more positive outcomes, e.g., enhanced enjoyment, meaning, and engagement. The lower ends of the scale were anchored with more negative outcomes, e.g., diminished enjoyment, etc. The scale midpoints were neutral in that they neither enhanced nor diminished. Data was binned to a 7-point Likert scale at the direction of the study’s biostatistician for use in our analyses. Participants selected a specific survey version based on whether they interacted with the plant system(s) or not, and we included only the scores from the crewmembers who participated in any given activity.\nPreliminary Results and Discussion for BHP Aims  Generally, engaging in tasks related to the plants and crop growth (a.k.a., Veggie tasks), was enjoyable. The highest ratings were related to consuming the harvested plants and voluntary viewing, suggesting that some crewmembers found time to experience the plants and nature as a source of enjoyment. Tending to the plants was also moderately enjoyable (e.g., plant thinning, pollinating, wick opening, and harvesting), indicating that there are BHP benefits from this work task.\nThe BHP impacts of whether the task was engaging, meaningful, supported well-being, or was demanding for a crewmember also indicates generally positive trends. Engaging, meaningful, and supporting well-being were strongly, and positively correlated with each other, which is consistent with behavioral health and workplace research that suggests that engaging and meaningful work can support well-being. Scores for these three positively-oriented variables increase over time, suggesting that the benefits of working with plants – that is, seeing them grow, tending to them, continuing to enjoy them as nature, and ultimately, consuming the fresh produce – becomes a greater source of behavioral health benefits as the long-duration mission continues.\nFor plant activities, not only are they generally enjoyable for those crewmembers engaging with the plants, but the data show voluntary viewing, watering, harvesting, and consuming as consistently, positively related to the task being engaging and meaningful, and enhancing well-being. Preliminary analyses suggest that working with plants in space as well as consuming them, can be a behavioral health countermeasure for long-duration spaceflight. Additional analyses will be completed for the final report and a publication is in the works.\nReferences  Curran, S. L., Andrykowski, M. A., & Studts, J. L. (1995).

Yet, most investigations of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment have been carried out on the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. It remains unknown whether the conclusions from such studies can be extrapolated to monocotyledonous plants. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose to investigate the growth, development, and transcriptome profiles of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings under spaceflight conditions, and compare these adaptive responses to those recently documented for Arabidopsis seedlings. These investigations will lead to a better understanding of the molecular and developmental mechanisms that contribute to Brachypodium adaptation to spaceflight conditions.

Because root growth and its architecture have recently been recognized as key contributors to plant productivity and adaptation to environmental stress, our research is also likely to have long-term impact in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. Furthermore, many of the behaviors under investigation involve auxin-related processes. This plant hormone is a key contributor to most aspects of plant growth, development, and response to the environment. Therefore, this project is likely to yield important new insights into some of the key mechanisms that control plant growth, development, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses."

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORTING NOVEMBER 2019:  Most of the studies of plant growth and adaptation to the microgravity environment have been carried out using Arabidopsis thaliana, a model dicot plant. However, most of the cultivated crops on Earth are monocots. Therefore, the purpose of our project was to investigate the impact of the microgravity environment present on the International Space Station (ISS) on the germination, growth, and morphology of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings, and evaluate their molecular adaptation to this environment using RNAseq analyses of transcription profiles. To do this, we first developed a new foam-based plant growth unit (named the APEX Growth Chamber), in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the Kennedy Space Center Flight Support Team. This chamber allows planting Brachypodium seeds within a block of foam on the ground, before flight. The seeds remain dry during take off and travel to the ISS. Upon arrival, an astronaut (Dr. Scott Tingle in our experiment) injects a nutritive solution into the foam, triggering seed germination and growth with the VEGGIE growth unit. Using this approach, we were able to grow 3 accessions of Brachypodium distachyon (Bd21, BD21-3, and Gaz-8) on ISS with four biological repeats per accession (four APEX Growth Chambers containing 24 seeds each). We also carried out two ground controls. One of these ground controls included germinating and growing the same accessions on the ground under conditions that mimicked those encountered on ISS, with a 48-h delay (ground control 1). A second ground control involved growing Bd21 seedlings under the same conditions for three days, followed by 5-min gravistimulation (GS) or 5-min mechanostimulation (MS) (ground control 2). At the end of each experiment, the seedlings were photographed, and the plant material was harvested and fixed in RNALater in KFT fixation units for subsequent analyses. Images were used to quantify root and shoot growth under both conditions, whereas plant materials were dissected to separate shoots and roots for subsequent expression profiling. RNA was extracted for RNASeq analysis. Our results show that the plants grown under microgravity displayed shorter, very hairy roots. Shoots were shorter in only one of the accessions tested (Bd21).\nExpression profiling revealed a large number of Bd21 genes whose expression either increased or decreased in shoots and/or roots under microgravity. Most of the differentially expressed genes were organ-specific, and did not respond to either GS or MS under ground-control conditions. The lists of microgravity-response genes were enriched for genes predicted to function in plant responses to environmental and oxidative stress as well as reactive oxygen species. They were also enriched for genes involved in radiation response, implying that Brachypodium might serve as a good model to investigate the effects of cosmic radiation on plants. Few of the microgravity-response genes were also differentially expressed in response to GS or MS on the ground. Those that did respond to both GS and microgravity constitute excellent candidates for a function in gravity signal transduction. Overall, our studies identify several genes and pathways that could be further engineered to improve monocot plant adaptation to the microgravity environment, facilitating their use in bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space-exploration missions.\nGround based studies were also carried out to investigate the natural variation that exists between Brachypodium accessions for root-growth and behavioral responses to GS. These studies led to the discovery of several key loci that may contribute to the regulation of proprioception in plants.\nExperimental Results and Conclusions\nDevelopment of a plant growth chamber to test Brachypodium distachyon seedlings growth under microgravity conditions\nTo test the ability of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings to germinate, grow, and adapt to the microgravity environment of the ISS, we developed a novel plant growth unit (named APEX Growth Chamber) in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the NASA Kennedy Space Center Flight Support team. This system is based on an Oasis foam-based growth system previously used by Dr. Levine to grow plants in space. With this setup, Brachypodium seeds are inserted pre-flight into a dry block of foam that is surrounded by gauze and a nylon mesh, and is mounted on a medium injection device within a Magenta-box assembly. The seeds are kept in a dormant dry state, unable to germinate during spaceflight to the ISS. When the experiment is ready for activation on ISS, an astronaut can easily inject liquid growth medium into the foam support through the injection device, thereby imbibing the seeds and triggering their germination under red light.\nThis novel plant germination and growth system had to be developed because early preparatory experiments had demonstrated that the far-red light pretreatment typically used to prevent the germination of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings on agar-based media during takeoff and travel to the ISS, has an opposite effect on agar-medium-embedded Brachypodium seeds, triggering their germination. An alternative light-based inhibition protocol we developed to inhibit Brachypodium seed germination during spaceflight could not be implemented because it required continuous seed exposure to blue-light and cold, thereby requiring excessive amounts of energy during a sensitive period of spaceflight.   Our flight experiment and corresponding ground control involved a total of 15 APEX Growth Units per condition, including 12 for each experiment, and 3 spare units. Three distinct accessions of Brachypodium distachyon were used, including Bd21 (whose genome serves as a reference for Brachypodium), Bd21-3 (which has been optimized for use in transformation experiments), and Gaz-8 (which displays different root-growth behaviors relative to Bd21 and Bd21-3 when grown on the ground). Four chambers (biological repeats) per accession were tested under microgravity conditions on ISS, and another four were exposed to 1-g on the ground under conditions that mimicked the flight experiment (ground control).\nThis material was prepared for flight to the ISS on March 27-30, 2018, and launched on Space X-14 on April 2, 2018. Upon transferring the 12 seeded APEX growth chambers from stowage into the ISS, astronaut Scott Tingle activated the experiment by injecting growth medium into the units on April 12, 2018. Seeds were allowed to germinate in the presence of red light for 24 hours, then blue and green lights were turned on and the plants were allowed to grow for three more days. At the end of this growth period, astronaut Tingle collected each APEX growth unit, took photographs of the seedlings growing on each face of the foam block, harvested the seedlings and placed them into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFT) for fixation in the presence of RNAlater. For each APEX Growth Unit, a few seedlings displayed roots that grew away from the foam surface and showed evidence of stress. These seedlings were harvested separately from those whose root tips were still contacting the block surface at harvesting time. Fixation in RNAlater was carried out at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The KFTs were then transferred to a cold storage device (-80°C) and returned to the ground on the Dragon capsule.\nThe environmental conditions experienced by the plants during their growth in VEGGIE on ISS were recorded, and then recapitulated in plant growth units at KSC during a first ground-based control. At the end of this experiment, the seedlings were also fixed in RNAlater at room temperature for 24 hours, then frozen at -80°C. These ground-control samples were also returned to the Principal Investigator (PI) laboratory, as were the pictures of seedlings grown under both microgravity and 1-g conditions.\nMicrogravity-grown seedlings are morphologically altered compared to ground-controls   The pictures of Brachypodium seedlings taken after 4 days of growth in the APEX Growth Units under microgravity and on the ground, were used to evaluate a potential effect of ISS-microgravity exposure on organs growth and seedling morphology. Seedlings of all three accessions displayed significantly shorter roots when grown under microgravity relative to ground controls. Furthermore, the shoots of microgravity-grown Bd21 seedlings were also shorter than ground controls, whereas those of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 were similar under both conditions. We conclude that Brachypodium distachyon accessions display distinct adaptive responses to the microgravity environment encountered on ISS. In addition to accession-specific alterations of organs growth, we also observed that the primary roots of microgravity-grown seedlings displayed longer root hairs than those of ground-control samples, and this phenotype was observed for all three accessions tested. This phenotype is rather surprising as previous studies had shown an opposite effect of microgravity on Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs (4).\nBrachypodium distachyon seedlings display organ-specific transcriptional responses to microgravity relative to ground control\nTo better understand the mechanisms that contribute to Brachypodium seedling adaptation to the microgravity environment of ISS, root and shoot tissues were dissected from frozen fixed Bd21 seedlings that had been exposed to the microgravity environment on ISS as well as ground-control materials. Total RNAs were extracted from these tissues and used to build TruSeq Stranded Total RNA libraries, which were sequenced in a Novaseq sequencer programmed to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. Library sequencing generated an average of 25 to 30 million reads per sample. Reads were trimmed to remove the adapter sequences using SKEWER, then filtered with FASTX_quality_filter to ensure that only high-quality reads (Phred scores above 35) are used for sequence alignments. The quality-filtered reads were mapped on the Brachypodium reference genome (version 3.1, from Phytozome) using the Bowtie2 algorithm. The TopHat 2 splice-junction mapper was used to compile transcript contigs, paying close attention to potential splice variants. HTseq-count was then used to define the numbers of reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) for genes and isoforms in each analyzed sample. DESeq (1) was used to normalize the numbers of reads and identify significantly differentially expressed transcripts. EdgeR (9) was also used as an alternative method to identify differentially expressed genes, and genes identified as significantly differentially expressed by both packages were retained for further analysis. The results of our DESeq comparisons are presented below.\nA principle component analysis (PCA) of expression profiles between experimental repeats revealed separate clustering between ground-control and microgravity-exposed samples, suggesting that there is more variation in expression profiles between environmental conditions than there is between repeats within a condition. Furthermore, ground-control root samples grouped more tightly in a sub-region of the PCA graph than those from microgravity-exposed root samples, suggesting a larger variation in expression profiles between repeats of the microgravity-exposed root samples relative to the ground controls.\nAnalysis of differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control seedlings identified 661 and 267 up-regulated genes in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively, relative to ground controls. Additionally, 1015 and 505 genes were found to be down-regulated in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively. A Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of these differentially expressed genes revealed an over-representation of genes potentially involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species and radiation, amongst other things.\nEven though many genes ended up being differentially expressed between microgravity and ground control samples, most were organ-specific. This is consistent with similar observations made with Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (5; 7). In fact, only 90 of the significantly differentially expressed genes are shared between roots and shoots. Of these, 35 are up-regulated and 30 down-regulated in both roots and shoots under microgravity. These genes constitute excellent candidates for a contribution to plant adaptive response to the microgravity environment of ISS. The remaining genes display opposite responses between shoots and roots. Several investigations of Arabidopsis seedling adaptation to spaceflight have also uncovered evidence of transcriptional responses involving genes that contribute to environmental and oxidative stress responses, as well as responses to reactive oxygen species (2-4; 6-8). On the other hand, our observation of enhanced expression of genes involved in radiation response under microgravity on ISS is particularly interesting considering the risks of exposure to cosmic radiations encountered by living organisms during spaceflight.\nA limited number of Brachypodium distachyon genes found to respond to the microgravity environment of ISS also respond to GS and/or MS on the ground.\nBecause Brachypodium distachyon seedling-organ responses to GS had not been previously characterized, we carried out a second ground-control experiment in this project, aimed at identifying genes whose expression is significantly altered in response to GS and/or MS. We germinated and grew Brachypodium Bd21-accession seeds in APEX Growth Chambers, within a VEGGIE growth unit at KSC under conditions that were programmed to mimic those recorded on ISS during the spaceflight experiment. After 4 days of growth, the APEX growth units were either gravity-stimulated by 180° reorientation, mechano-stimulated by 360° rotation, or not stimulated (control), and the seedlings were allowed to grow in their new orientation for an additional 5 min. Each treatment involved four repeats (four APEX Growth units). After stimulation, the seedlings were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (7/19/2018), then frozen at -80°C after 1 day at room temperature. These samples were returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and dissected to separate shoot and root tissues. RNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed (activated or repressed) in response to GS or MS. Similar sequence-analysis packages were used as those described above for RNASeq analysis of Brachypodium organ responses to microgravity.\nThis analysis revealed only small numbers of significantly differentially expressed genes between GS-/MS-induced samples and ground controls. It is, however, particularly compelling to note that 10 genes were found to be differentially expressed in response to both GS and microgravity exposure in roots. Six of these genes were repressed upon GS and activated upon exposure to microgravity, whereas the other four genes were activated in response to GS and repressed by exposure to microgravity. Therefore, these 10 genes constitute strong candidates for a contribution to gravity response in roots. They will be subjected to functional characterization.\nEqually interesting is another list of 10 genes that are transcriptionally responsive to both MS and microgravity exposure. Of these, eight were found to be down-regulated in response to MS and up-regulated upon exposure to microgravity, one was up-regulated in response to MS and down-regulated in response to microgravity, and the last one was found to be up-regulated in response to both treatments. One of these genes was also found in the list of 10 genes that are responsive to both GS and microgravity exposure. Overall, the latter group of 10 genes jointly regulated by MS and microgravity exposure are likely to contribute to plant responses to their mechanical environment. They will also be prioritized for further functional characterization.\nIn conclusion, we note that a vast majority of the genes found to be differentially expressed upon GS or MS on the ground are not transcriptionally responsive to the microgravity conditions experienced on ISS, suggesting that Brachypodium seedling organs interpret the microgravity environment of ISS very differently from GS and/or MS on the ground. This observation holds true for both shoot and root samples. It is compatible with similar observations made by others using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model (2-4; 6-8). A manuscript describing this work is in preparation.\nUsing a Genome-Wide Association Study approach to identify loci that contribute to root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior in Brachypodium distachyon seedlings\nIn addition to the APEX-06 experiment described above, we have also completed our comparative analysis of root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior on agar surfaces for 46 distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions, using time lapse-analysis of root-growth behavior coupled with automated computer-driven biometric analysis of imaged roots. Our quantitative analysis of root growth behavior included determinations of root growth rates, root tip angles from the vertical, and elemental curvatures along the roots.\nWhen growing on vertical plates, Brachypodium roots from most accessions grow straight down, as dictated by gravitropism. However, while doing so, the root-tip also tends to curve leftward and rightward of the vertical. The tip curvatures associated with these oscillations typically disappear as the differentially elongated cells migrate from the distal side of the elongation zone to more proximal regions, an auto-straightening process that is reminiscent of proprioception in animal systems. Upon 90-degree reorientation within the gravity field (gravity stimulation), the roots initiate a phase of rapid downward bending, which is followed by a second, slower phase of curvature response that is accompanied by root-tip oscillations similar to those preceding the gravity stimulus. Distinct Brachypodium accessions differ from each other in the frequency and amplitude of their root tip oscillations, as well as in the bending rate following gravity stimulation.\nTo better capture the genetic basis of variation between accessions for these traits, we developed a mathematical model that recapitulates the evolution of root tip angles from the vertical before, during and after gravity stimulation. When applied to the 46 accessions under investigation, this model is very effective at recapitulating accession-specific growth behaviors, with best-fit curves correlating well with the observed data (R-square larger than 0.9). These best-fit equations, along with Fast Fourier Transform analysis, allowed estimation of descriptive parameters for these behaviors, including root growth rate, rapid bending rates during phase 1 of gravitropism, and frequency and amplitude of oscillations.\nBecause each one of these 46 accessions had previously been subjected to genome sequencing, we were able to use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with these parameters. This analysis allowed us to identify linked loci whose contribution to oscillatory root growth behavior are being investigated using a combination of expression analysis, reverse genetics and cell biology approaches. A paper describing this research is also being prepared for publication.\nBroader Impact of Our Work\nOverall, these studies may impact our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of coordinated cell expansion and its roles in growth regulation, plant morphogenesis and plant organs' growth responses and adaptation to gravity and/or microgravity. In the longer term, our studies may enable us to engineer plants that are better suited to function as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space exploration missions, or more simply for effective growth and productivity in natural and/or agricultural ecosystems on Earth.\nNew Technology Development: The foam-based vessel (APEX Growth Chamber) we developed in collaboration with Dr. Howard Levine and the KSC Flight Support Team has been submitted to NASA Technology Transfer System (KSC-14282).\nCited Literature\n1.

Bioinformatics 26:139-40\nJUNE 2019 REPORT: As summarized in our previous progress reports, we developed a novel plant growth unit (named APEX growth chamber) to support the growth of Brachypodium distachyon seedlings under microgravity in the International Space Station (ISS). This system is based on an Oasis foam-based growth device previously used by Dr. Howard Levine to grow plants in space (NASA Space Biology Program).  Our units were designed in a collaborative effort involving Dr. Levine and the NASA Flight Support Team. With this system, seeds are inserted pre-flight into a dry block of foam, which is mounted on a medium injection device within a Magenta box. The seeds are kept in a dormant dry state, unable to germinate during spaceflight to the ISS. When the experiment is ready for initiation on ISS, an astronaut can easily inject liquid growth medium into the foam support through the injection device, thereby imbibing the seeds and triggering their germination under red light.\nThe flight experiment and corresponding ground control were carried out in March 2018 (APEX-06 mission). These experiments involved a total of 15 APEX Growth Units per condition, including 12 for each experiment and 3 spare ones. Three distinct accessions of Brachypodium distachyon were used, including Bd21 (whose genome serves as a reference for Brachypodium), BD21-3 (which has been optimized for use in transformation experiments), and Gaz-8 (which displays different root growth behaviors relative to Bd21 and Bd21-3 when grown on the ground). Four chambers (biological repeats) per accession were tested under microgravity conditions on ISS, and another four were exposed to 1-g on the ground under conditions that mimicked the flight experiment (ground control).\nAs previously reported, this material was prepared for flight to the ISS on March 27-30, 2018, and launched on SpaceX-14 on April 2, 2018. Upon transferring the 12 seeded APEX growth chambers from stowage into the ISS, astronaut Scott Tingle activated the experiment by injecting growth medium into the units on April 12, 2018.  Seeds were allowed to germinate in the presence of red light for 24 hours, then blue and green lights were turned on and the plants were allowed to grow for three more days. At the end of this growth period, astronaut Tingle collected each APEX growth unit, took photographs of each face, harvested the seedlings, and placed them into KFT for fixation in the presence of RNAlater. For each APEX Growth Unit, a few seedlings displayed roots that grew away from the foam surface and showed evidence of stress. These seedlings were harvested separately from those whose root tips were still contacting the block surface at harvesting time. Fixation in RNAlater was carried out at room temperature for a period of 24 h. The KFTs were then transferred to a cold storage device (-80°C) and returned to the ground on the Dragon capsule.\nThe environmental conditions experienced by the plants during their growth period in VEGGIE on ISS were recorded, and then recapitulated in plant growth units at KSC during a first ground-based control. At the end of this experiment, the seedlings were also fixed in RNAlater. After similar storage under -80°C conditions, the samples were returned to the Principal Investigator (PI) laboratory, as were the pictures of seedlings grown under both microgravity and 1-g conditions. As reported last year, seedlings grown under microgravity displayed significant root-growth inhibition compared to ground controls for all accessions tested. The shoots of microgravity-grown Bd21 seedlings were also shorter than ground control, but those of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 were similar under both gravity conditions. We conclude that distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display distinct adaptive responses to the microgravity environment encountered on ISS. In addition to accession-specific slight alterations of organs growth, we also observed that the primary roots of microgravity-grown seedlings displayed longer root hairs than those of ground-control samples.\nTo better understand the mechanisms that contribute to Brachypodium seedlings adaptation to the microgravity environment of ISS, root and shoot tissues were dissected from frozen fixed Bd21 seedlings that had been exposed to the microgravity environment on ISS as well as ground-control material. Total RNAs were extracted from these tissues and used to build TruSeq Stranded Total RNA libraries, which were sequenced in a Novaseq sequencer programmed to generate 150-bp paired-end reads. Library sequencing generated an average of 25 to 30 million reads per sample. Sequence analysis involved a pipeline that included FastQC to control for the quality of sequence reads and filter out poor reads, Tophat2 to align each reads to the reference Brachypodium genome, Bowtie2 to build an index, HTseq to count the number of reads assigned to each annotated gene/transcript, and DEseq (R package) to evaluate differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control samples.\nA principle component analysis (PCA) of expression profiles between experimental repeats revealed separate clustering between ground-control and microgravity-exposed samples, suggesting that there is more variation in expression profiles between environmental conditions than there is between repeats within a condition. Furthermore, ground-control root samples grouped more tightly in a sub-region of the PCA graph than those from microgravity-exposed root samples, suggesting a larger variation in expression profiles exists between repeats of the microgravity-exposed root samples relative to the ground controls.\nInitial analysis of differential expression between microgravity-exposed and ground control seedlings identified 398 and 159 significantly up-regulated genes in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively, relative to ground controls. Additionally, 867 and 380 significantly down-regulated genes were found in microgravity-exposed shoots and roots, respectively. A Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of these differentially expressed genes revealed an over-representation of genes potentially involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli and oxidative stress, amongst other things.\nBecause the Brachypodium distachyon seedling organ responses to gravity stimulation have not been well characterized, we also carried out a second control experiment in this project, aimed at identifying genes whose expression is significantly altered in response to gravity- and/or mechano-stimulation.  As reported last year, we germinated and grew Bd21 seeds in APEX Growth Chambers, within a VEGGIE unit, under growth conditions that were programmed to mimic those recorded on ISS during the spaceflight experiment. After four days of growth, the APEX growth units were either gravity-stimulated by 180° reorientation, mechano-stimulated by 360° rotation, or unstimulated (control), and the seedlings were allowed to grow in their new position for five minutes. Each stimulus involved four repeats (four APEX Growth units). After 5-min incubations, the seedlings were harvested and fixed in RNAlater (7/19/2018), then frozen at -80°C after one day of fixation. These samples were returned to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where each sample was dissected to separate shoot and root tissues. RNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed by RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed between treatments. Currently, the analytical pipeline described above is being used to analyze the RNAseq profiles and identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed (activated or repressed) in response to mechano- or gravity-stimulation. The groups of genes found to be differentially expressed under microgravity on ISS will be compared to those that are differentially expressed in response to gravity- or mechano-stimulation under 1-g. Reverse genetics will then be used to investigate the contribution of these genes to plant responses to microgravity, gravity- or mechano-stimulation.\nIn addition to the APEX-06 experiment described above, we have also completed our comparative analysis of root gravitropism and oscillatory root growth behavior on agar surfaces for 45 distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions, using time lapse-analysis of root growth behavior coupled with automated computer-driven biometric analysis of imaged roots. Our quantitative analysis of root growth behavior included determinations of root growth rates, root tip angles from the vertical, and elemental curvatures along the roots.\nWhen growing on vertical plates, Brachypodium roots from most accessions grow straight down, as dictated by gravitropism. However, while doing so, the root-tip also tends to curve leftward and rightward of the vertical. The tip curvatures associated with these oscillations typically disappear as the differentially elongated cells migrate from the distal side of the elongation zone to more proximal regions, an auto-straightening process that is reminiscent of proprioception in animal systems.

These best-fit equations, along with Fast Fourier Transform analysis, allowed estimation of descriptive parameters for these behaviors, including root growth rate, rapid bending rates during phase 1 of gravitropism, and frequency and amplitude of oscillations.\nBecause each one of these 45 accessions had previously been subjected to genome sequencing, we were able to use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with these parameters. SNPs showing significant probabilities of association with several growth parameters including the maximal rate of rapid bending and the amplitude of oscillations, have been identified and are being characterized. Overall, these studies have allowed us to identify linked loci whose contribution to oscillatory root growth behavior are being investigated using a combination of expression analysis, reverse genetics and cell biology approaches.\nOverall, these studies may impact our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of coordinated cell expansion and its roles in growth regulation, plant morphogenesis, and plant organs' growth responses and adaptation to gravity and/or microgravity.

            "task_description": "This research has capitalized on the capabilities of the VEGGIE hardware to address how spaceflight affects plant gene expression and growth related to low oxygen stress (hypoxia). Hypoxia is thought to develop in spaceflight as weightlessness nullifies the buoyancy-driven convection that usually aids in mixing and supplying gas (oxygen) around organisms. Our analysis of Arabidopsis grown on the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the BRIC17 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiment is consistent with the plants grown in space having experienced long-term hypoxic stress. These plants also showed hallmarks of up-regulating Ca2+- and reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) pathways (such as those supported by the enzyme RBOHD). Further, we have identified a Ca2+ transporter named CAX2 as playing a critical role in this hypoxic signaling system. We therefore have used the plant growth capabilities of the VEGGIE to significantly extend our insights into hypoxic stress. Wild-type, rbohD, and cax2 mutant seedlings were grown on orbit. After 8 days, samples were photographed, fixed in RNAlater using Kennedy Fixation Tubes, and frozen for subsequent post-flight analysis. For analysis, we have quantified patterns of growth and gene expression using the techniques of RNAseq and qPCR. In addition, analysis of a ROS reporter gene tagged with green fluorescent protein has been made using fluorescence microscopy. Comparison to plants grown on the ground help define how much of the responses seen on orbit can be explained by the development of long-term hypoxia linked to the microgravity environment. Results from this analysis are expected to advance our understanding of hypoxic response in plants grown in both space and on Earth in addition to testing whether the hypoxic Ca2+ signaling system provides targets for genetically engineering potential countermeasures to low oxygen stress.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research has addressed how spaceflight may induce stresses related to reduced oxygen availability in plants. The work has targeted the role of Ca2+ signaling and reactive oxygen species as components of this response to define molecular components of the system. The results from this work will both provide insight into a potentially important element of spaceflight-related stress and also help to define elements of the low oxygen response system that operates on Earth. Plants on Earth experience such conditions during flooding of the soil, when there is a large microbial population in the soil consuming available oxygen and even when the metabolic activities within the plant's own tissues are intense enough to consume available oxygen. These natural low oxygen events are sensed by plants and can lead to either changes in growth and development to accommodate or escape them, or in extreme cases they can lead to significant losses in productivity and even death. These spaceflight experiments on low oxygen sensing mechanisms will therefore help provide molecular targets for potential manipulation to help make plants more tolerant of low oxygen and so contribute to agronomically important traits such as flooding tolerance in crop plants."

            "task_progress": "APEX-05 mission and sample analyses: APEX05 successfully launched on SpaceX-13. Plants were grown on orbit in the Veggie hardware, were returned frozen, and gene expression analysis using RNAseq also successfully completed. The experimental plants grew for 8 days on orbit and showed the expected levels of vigorous development, comparable to the parallel ground controls. All flight success criteria and subsequent sample analyses were in the excellent range.\nThe overarching hypothesis for the APEX05 experimental design is that spaceflight imposes hypoxic and oxidative stress that will be disrupted in the cax2 and atrbohd mutants and that this will be reflected in the patterns of gene expression from plants growing on orbit. This idea is supported by direct analysis of various Arabidopsis ecotypes grown on the ISS and by comparison of the transcriptional responses from multiple plant spaceflight experiments analyzed using the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database, which aggregates much of the available data in this area. Comparison of gene expression patterns in flight vs ground samples for APEX-05 indicate these ideas are likely correct. The wild type control plants showed patterns of gene expression consistent with both hypoxia and oxidative stress as well as reduction in both root and shoot growth when compared to ground controls.\nAPEX-05 cax2 responses: The hypoxia resistant cax2 mutants showed reduced induction of hypoxia-related transcripts in spaceflight. Consistent with these observations, the cax2 mutants also showed high basal expression of several molecular markers of hypoxic response, suggesting they were constitutively adapted to hypoxia, even when O2 levels were normal. Further, in ground-based controls on Earth showed these mutants were resistant to hypoxia and to flooding stress (another low oxygen environment), again consistent with a constant hypoxia response pre-adapting them to this stress. CAX2 is a Ca2+ pump that should attenuate the Ca2+ signaling triggered by low oxygen levels and the cax2 mutants showed elevated basal Ca2+ levels and significantly higher hypoxia-induced Ca2+ signals, providing a potential mechanism for their constitutive and enhanced low O2 stress resilience.\nAPEX-05 rbohd responses: The wild-type plants in space also showed evidence of the induction of genes responsive to oxidative stress, such as a suite of molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein family. These genes were not induced in the rbohD mutant, which maintained growth in spaceflight above levels of the wild type control plants. In ground controls, the rbohd mutants also showed resistance to hypoxic and flooding stresses, suggesting hypoxia and ROS signaling may be intimately interrelated in spaceflight responses.\nGround-based analyses: As part of these studies a series of ground-based analyses have been conducted to help either develop assays for the spaceflight experiments, or to better define the Ca2+ and ROS-based signaling in plants likely triggered by spaceflight. An improved red-light based system to impose dormancy on Arabidopsis seeds to aid in their transfer to orbit for APEX-05 has been developed and a collaboration with the Townsend group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has led to production of a hyperspectral imaging system to investigate how this technology might be applied to monitoring plant stress in growth chamber environments such as the Veggie hardware used for APEX-05. During analyses of signaling events, a new plant-wide ROS and Ca2+ signaling system based on propagating waves of Ca2+ has been revealed. Additionally, a new transcriptional reporter for monitoring the dynamics of ROS-imposed stress throughout the plant has been developed.\nPresentations and Outreach/Education: The APEX-05 project has been presented at numerous national and international meetings including regularly at the Plant Cell Dynamics Meeting, the ISS Research and Development Conference, the annual meetings of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, and the American Society of Plant Biology, and at university venues ranging from South Dakota State to the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. APEX-05 has also been central to a series of outreach activities, being regularly presented at events ranging from University of Wisconsin sponsored outreach days (e.g., University of Wisconsin’s Science Expeditions) to presentations for high school students, undergraduates, and middle school and K-12 teachers (such as regularly at the BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute summer training program for teachers). APEX-05 has also been featured in some unique mentoring opportunities such as to multiple groups participating in the plant space biology themed First Lego League Championship over 2018-2019. Multiple cohorts of undergraduates have also participated in designing and fabricating hardware such as the red-light dormancy inducing system used in the APEX-05 flight or clinostats and low O2 chambers used in the ground-based controls for the APEX-05 experimentation.",

Change in organism used in this project, approved by NASA Headquarters.\nEnterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic human pathogen consistently isolated and detected by molecular analysis on board the International Space Station (ISS). The ability of this organism to survive outside of the human gut may have important implications for its spread to a new host environment.  The goal of this study is to characterize the desiccation survival capacity of ISS isolated E. faecalis strains and to investigate their pathogenicity in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. First, we shall provide the first comparative genomic information of E. faecalis strains to characterize strain-specific sequence variants and the identification of traits that may confer increased resistance to desiccation and antibiotics. We will also examine the presence of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) that confer bacterial resistance to foreign DNA and may provide an additional method of persistence to the transfer of mobile genetic elements. Phenotypic data will determine how desiccation tolerance varies, and how these variations relate to the clinical and commensal strain types. In vivo pathogenicity tests will culminate our investigation into the effect of E. faecalis biofilm morphotypes on the ability to establish infection in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. This work will help to determine genomic, phenotypic, and physiological basis for various desiccation and antibiotic resistance of ISS isolated E. faecalis, and provide insight to pathogenicity of spaceflight isolated microorganisms, where astronaut immunity is decreased and the availability of antibiotics is limited.",

Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms. By harnessing the technology already onboard the ISS, the crew will then be able to achieve near-real time detection of isolates that may impact crew health.",

NASA is providing the isolates for all studies.\nOVERVIEW\nThe proposed work will offer genetics-based avenues to gain insight into all 3 of the guiding questions as listed in this solicitation, but will directly address: “Does long-duration spaceflight alter normal rates of evolutionary change?”\nWe propose to perform whole-genome sequencing of 50 isolates from the International Space Station (ISS) focused within the genera Staphylococcus and Ralstonia. These ISS-isolate genomes will be analyzed within the context of both an exhaustive, Earth-based reference genomic library constructed for each genus, and ISS astronaut microbiome metagenomic data. Co-Investigator Alexander Voorhies and collaborator Hernan Lorenzi are currently working with ‘before,’ ‘during,’ and ‘after’ microbiome metagenome from 9 ISS astronauts that were onboard the space station for various lengths of time spanning 2013–2016. Our unique position of being able to integrate microbiome sequencing data from another NASA effort with newly sequenced genomes of ISS isolates offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore many Space Biology evolutionary questions at the molecular level.\nOBJECTIVES/METHODS\nGenera Staphylococcus and Ralstonia were selected based on several criteria including ubiquity within human microbiota, potential pathogenicity, and their abundant representation within Earth-based reference databases, the ISS archive of available isolates, and our currently in-hand astronaut microbiome metagenomic data. We will investigate many metrics of molecular evolution aboard the ISS by directly addressing the following questions:\n1) Are any particular genetic elements (i.e., genes/gene cassettes/operons) disproportionately represented in ISS isolates as compared to their Earth-based, nearest phylogenetic relatives?\n2) Are there different propensities for specific individual genome mutations (i.e., single-point mutations such as substitutions/insertions/deletions, non-synonymous to synonymous substitution ratios, transition to transversion ratios, and genetic rearrangements) for organisms in the space-based built environment?\n3) Which specific genes (and codons within these genes) are under positive, negative, or neutral selection aboard the ISS, but not within terrestrial references?\n4) Can we track microbial transmission from an individual astronaut to the built environment, and/or the ISS serving as a vector and contributing to the microbiome of resident astronauts?\n5) As assessed via comparison to metagenome-assembled genomes reconstructed from ISS-astronaut microbiomes, how representative are the isolate genomes recovered from the ISS of the actual microbiota of ISS astronauts?",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "SIGNIFICANCE\nMicroorganisms are not only integral to human health, but are also inexorable and necessary components of any self-contained elemental cycling, food production, or water system, and longer-duration human space exploration will require all of these systems. To design safe, built-environment microbial ecosystems to support these life-support systems requires not only understanding short-term, “plastic” microbial responses to the space environment, but also longer-term propensities for microbial evolution and adaptation. This work will leverage newly developed genetics-based computational tools, technologies, and approaches to generate the first comprehensive, whole-genomic database of microorganisms isolated from the space-based built environment while addressing fundamental questions about evolution aboard the ISS."

Using assembled genomes of our ISS-derived microbial isolates as references and recruiting metagenomic reads from an astronaut’s nasal microbiome revealed no recruitment to a Staphylococcus aureus isolate from samples before launch, yet systematic recruitment across the genome when sampled after 3 months aboard the ISS, with a median percent identity of 100%. This suggests that either a highly similar S. aureus population colonized the astronaut’s nasal microbiome while the astronaut was aboard the ISS or that it may have been below detection before spaceflight, instead supporting a shift in community composition. This work highlights the value in generating genomic libraries of microbes from built-environments such as the ISS and demonstrates one way such data can be integrated with metagenomics to facilitate the tracking and monitoring of astronaut microbiomes and health.\nLee et al.

            "task_description": "Space radiation and microgravity are two major environmental stressors for human in space travel. One of the fundamental questions in space biology research is whether the combined effects of microgravity and exposure to cosmic radiation are synergistic. While studies addressing this question have been carried out for half a century in space or using simulated microgravity on the ground, the reported results are conflicting. Although the reason for the variation in results is not known, it is possible that it may be due to the diversity of biological systems used but more importantly to the experimental designs and hardware used in these studies. For the assessment and management of human health risks in future Moon and Mars Missions, it is necessary to obtain more basic data on the molecular and cellular responses to combined effects of radiation and microgravity.\nTo establish a firm baseline database, we propose to undertake a systematic study on cultured mammalian cells' responses to the simultaneous insult of radiation and microgravity (both immediate and long term) to elucidate the molecular signaling pathways that lead to these biological effects. The results of the study will provide cellular and molecular biological bases for the assessment and management of human health risks in space.\nRecently Dr. Takahashi, co-investigator of this proposal, has developed microgravity-irradiation systems consisting of a 3D clinostat synchronized to the carbon-ion or X-ray irradiation systems. Our new experimental setup allows us to avoid stopping clinostat rotation during irradiation, which was required in all other previous experiments. Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center is the only facility in the world where we can expose samples to high-linear energy transfer (LET) irradiation as well as low-LET irradiation under the simulated microgravity condition (i.e., without interrupting clinostat rotation).\nOur preliminary data obtained from the use of this new device on gene expression in human fibroblasts show that splicing cycle-related genes and cell cycle related genes are significantly up-regulated and S-phase DNA replication and DNA repair-related genes were down-regulated with C-ion irradiation under simulated microgravity.\nIn this proposal we will investigate 3 different endpoints from early to late responses in 2 human cell lines using our new devices to study combined effects of microgravity and space radiation. Human fibroblasts and epithelial cells will be exposed to X-rays and C-ions under the simulated microgravity condition (rotated with 3-D clinostat). Control cells will be irradiated in 1G environment (with the static stage). We will investigate the extent of expression of specific proteins and of the post-translational modification states of signaling proteins (Aim 1), gene expressions and the pathways involved (Aim 2), and the extent of chromosome aberrations (Aim 3) caused by the combined effects of simulated microgravity and radiation. To investigate from the early to late endpoints in the same cell types will provide cellular and molecular biological data that are needed to understand the impact of combined effects of simulated microgravity and space radiation on human health. One of the selected endpoints is chromosome aberration, which is a well-established biomarker for cancer risk and has been used by NASA for the risk assessment of astronauts. Studying this endpoint allows us to compare our results to the astronauts' data after their International Space Station missions.\nCompletion of this proposal will allow us to determine how the combination of microgravity and radiation will affect the transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic states of cells as well as heritable changes in DNA. These finding will allow us to help develop the countermeasures for the future space missions.",

A three-dimensional clinostat was used to accomplish the simulation of µG and the simultaneous radiation exposure of the samples. In total, 36 samples were analyzed (12 conditions in triplicates). The raw transcriptomic data produced from these studies were reanalyzed in the current work, applying a systems biology approach, to identify all differentially expressed genes (DEG) between various conditions and the predominant processes they participate in, and to identify a possible synergy between radiation and µG.  RNAseq, employing DESeq2, was the method used to produce lists of differentially expressed genes between different biological conditions. Over-representation analyses were performed in order to identify the enriched biological pathways and targeting transcription factors in up- and down-regulated genes from each DEG analysis.\nComparing sham-irradiated cells under simulated µG and 1G conditions, terms related to response to oxygen levels and muscle contraction were identified. After irradiation with 1Gy of X-ray or C-ion or simulated µG condition, CDKN1A, MDM2, PURPL, PTCHD4, TP53INP1, PAPPA and BTG2 were found to be over-expressed, while MKI67, CCNB1, histone clustered genes, and minichromosome maintenance genes were found to be under-expressed. Prevailing biological processes in DEGs upon irradiation were related to DNA damage repair, signal transduction by p53 class mediator, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis.\nChromosome Aberrations (CA):\nWe have also reported our newly established \"Simulator of the environments on the Moon and Mars with Neutron-irradiation and Gravity change\" (“SwiNG”), for in vitro experiments (Takahashi et al., 2020) in last year’s report.

Chromosomes were analyzed with 3-color whole-chromosome FISH staining. Cells exposed to radiation and partial gravity simultaneously showed higher frequencies of CA compared to exposed to radiation under 1G.",

Clinical and preclinical evidence indicates that cartilage degradation in the hip and knee joints occurs with reduced weight-bearing.

Deterioration of the hip and knee joint during prolonged spaceflight has the potential to reduce an astronaut’s performance during a mission, cause arthritis, and negatively impact the astronaut’s long-term quality of life (QOL). Our study will test the hypothesis that mouse hip and knee joints exposed to microgravity on the International Space Station (ISS) or from reduced weight bearing via tail-suspended with or without exposure to spaceflight-relevant doses of radiation in Definition Phase studies will exhibit profound tissue degradation.  Additionally, this degradation can be recovered using aerobic (running) and resistance (climbing) exercise countermeasures.\nTo study these problems, we will determine the hip and knee joint damage that occurs in mice that will fly in space on the International Space Station for 30 days. This damage will be compared to the hip and knee joint damage in another group of mice kept on Earth that also will not have weight on the hip and knee joints for 30 days, with or without receiving radiation exposure that simulates a solar flare. Damage to the hip and knee joint structures will be determined using imaging techniques, engineering devices to measure tissue strength, stained tissue sections, and identification of the molecules that cause the damage. The ability to walk normally after 30 days of weightlessness will also be determined. Finally, we will determine if treadmill running or climbing can reverse any of the hip and knee joint damage caused by being in the weightless space environment.\nOur goal is to determine, 1] if hip and knee joint damage occurs in the weightless space environment, and 2] if recovery from this damage is possible with exercise.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "From these studies, we also will gain insights into how arthritis and joint failure develop in both patients that receive radiation therapy for the treatment for cancer, and in patients with limited mobility (cancer patients, wheel-chair bound spinal cord injury patients, or after limb surgery), and how this can be prevented."

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORTING SEPTEMBER 2021\nWith a return to lab from COVID restrictions, we compiled and wrote a manuscript that incorporated all the finished data from our ISS mission, together with the parallel ground-based tail suspension study (with and without a readaptation period that included exercise interventions or not), and also included data from knee joint degradation that were collected during the final Space Shuttle mission (STS-135).  Our final conclusion was that spaceflight and reduced weight-bearing on the ground induce an arthritic response in the knees of mice, which can be reversed with a return to weight-bearing (after hindlimb unloading-HLU) if exercise is performed.  This final paper was submitted to Scientific Reports and published in the fall.  Moreover, the student who was working on the project as his dissertation research, Andy Kwok, wrote and defended his dissertation in Spring, 2021. [Ed. note: see Bibliography section for noted publications]\nANNUAL REPORTING SEPTEMBER 2020\nWe examined if reduced weight bearing on Earth using a hindlimb unloading (HU) model could cause damage to menisci and cartilage, as during spaceflight.  What we found was that in male and female mice, the degree of cartilage and meniscus damage was similar to what was observed after 30 days in space, and occurred at the same location (the region in the knee that supports most of the weight versus gravity).  Thus cartilage degradation, and meniscal loss, occurs with reduced weight bearing, and HU is a good analogue for joint damage that occurs during spaceflight.\nWe then identified that both running and climbing exercise can in part mitigate the damage to cartilage and menisci that is caused by reduced weight bearing.",

            "task_description": "The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.\nThe objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.\nTogether, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures.",

            "task_progress": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. Our research goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX CRS-12 (SpaceX-12) at the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in August 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/- 4 hours of splashdown, ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were sacrificed after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight. The flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to the control groups. Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed changes in biomarker expressions related to BRB integrity. Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.\nExtended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/-4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.\nAstronauts returning from spaceflight have experienced eye problems, which may decrease retinal performance and lead to long-term effects on visual acuity. This study leverages the collected data from spaceflown murine retinas that were treated with redox-active metalloporphyrin (BuOE) to mitigate spaceflight-induced changes and respective ground controls. 10-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown on SpaceX-24 (RR-18) to the ISS national lab, kept in low Earth orbit for 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. Our multi-omics analysis of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data generated from subsequent murine retina tissues uncovered genes, pathways, and epigenetic modifications consistent with the therapeutic potential of BuOE. From RNA-Seq analysis of spaceflown murine samples, the treatment group shows differentially expressed genes relative to saline controls that reached significance, and genes that are related to protection against cell oxidative damage and cellular response to organonitrogen compounds. Ranked fold-changes from the same contrast were used for gene set enrichment analysis, which showed biological processes reaching significance, including glutathione metabolic processes and cellular response to xenobiotic stimulus. The findings from this investigation have the potential to provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying conditions like Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) and assess the effectiveness of BuOE as a countermeasure for astronauts experiencing neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities, which can lead to long-term effects on visual acuity.\nThe physical demands of deep-space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, understanding this has the potential to guide strategies to mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight, or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected for DSP: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis 1 (CA), and Dentate Gyrus (DG). Because spaceflight is associated with increased oxidative stress, treatment with antioxidants has emerged as a potential strategy to attenuate the effects of spaceflight. We therefore treated a subset of the spaceflight and control mice with the superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), and performed DSP on them as well. Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) due to spaceflight in all four regions of frontal cortex, cortex, CA1, and DG, with CA having the highest number of DEGs. Each brain region showed a distinct transcriptomic response, while some DEGs were common to two or more regions. A pathway analysis revealed distinct pathways sensitive to oxidative stress, as well as metabolic pathways, to be enriched in each of the brain regions. These represent the first spatial gene expression profiles taken of rodents in space, and may help improve our understanding of brain region-specific susceptibility to spaceflight conditions.  Treatment with BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of DEGs, suggesting that BuOE may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage.\nThe goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1g on the acute and late intraocular pressure (IOP) changes and function of the retina. To determine the extent to which an antioxidant protects against spaceflight environment-induced changes in the retina, the mice were administered weekly superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE) or saline treatments, before launch and during their stay aboard the ISS. Forty ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on SpaceX-24 over 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before launch, IOP was measured using a handheld tonometer, and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG).  ERG data was recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to a weak, diffuse, full-field flash of light. Within 20 hours after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before sacrifice. Subsets of mice will be measured after 6 months of the spaceflight for the re-adaptation study. There were significant increases in body weight for both habitat control and vivarium control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements (p<0.05). However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown.  The IOP measurements were similar between pre-and post-flight groups. There were no significant differences between BuOE-treated mice and saline controls. To assess the retinal function, we measured the amplitude of the scotopic ERG b-wave, which is primarily generated by ON-type bipolar cells.  Bipolar cells are the main neurons of the retina that carry signals from photoreceptors to ganglion cells.  These data indicate, for the first time, spaceflight conditions may induce bipolar cell damage and dysfunction.\nIt has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel, digital color-coded barcode counting technology was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from the flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response was significantly downregulated. Here, we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on neuronal function.",

            "task_description": "Parasitoid wasps are obligate parasites of their insect hosts. Most parasitoid wasps of Drosophila attack larval stages of fruit flies and consume the developing host, while growing inside its body. A normal immune response to wasp attack consists of the so-called encapsulation response in which dozens of differentiated blood cells or hemocytes migrate toward the egg to tightly encase, melanize and kill it. Parasitoid wasps produce factors in their venom to disrupt this immune reaction to ensure their success.   In this study we examined the relative success of natural hosts and their parasites reared in space. We also assessed the effects of spaceflight on the immune physiology of Drosophila hosts and on parasite virulence.  Two host strains, without and with inflammatory tumors, and two wasp species, differing in infection strategies were used in the experiment. Using physiological, cellular and molecular readouts, we found:   (a) Flies without tumors and chronic inflammation were more sensitive to spaceflight conditions than tumor-bearing flies suffering from inflammation. Many essential genes in ‘healthy’ flies were downregulated. (b) Spaceflight spiked the expression of inflammation genes in fruit flies of both strains; space-travel enhanced tumor growth in tumor-bearing flies; larval progeny of these ‘space’ flies showed a higher tumor burden and were more strongly immune reactive than ‘ground’ controls. (c) Spaceflight did not significantly affect parasitic wasp development, emergence, or the expression of virulence genes; (d) Parasite mutants of one wasp species with defects in wing color, wing shape, and ovipositor morphology were identified and obtained.  Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to human and animal health during spaceflight. Our studies reveal the unique and shared effects of spaceflight on the physiology and gene expression on distinct strains of Drosophila hosts.

Distant relatives of these parasitic wasps are used for biocontrol of agricultural pests worldwide.\nThe \"Earth benefits\" impact of our research are as follows:\n(a)  RNA-Seq analysis of adult fruit flies (wild type and mutants developing inflammatory microtumors) will help in understanding the effects of spaceflight in humans and develop countermeasures for immune dysfunction.\n(b) RNA-Seq analysis of parasite transcriptomes in response to spaceflight with emphasis on virulence-related genes is providing novel insights into how endoparasites (those that develop within their hosts) react to the pressures as they develop in low Earth orbit.\nWhereas RNA-Seq-based gene expression analysis is now a standard experimental approach in biomedical research, the paucity of space-related research opportunities applied to model organisms have not allowed the potential of such ‘omics’ approaches to be realized toward spaceflight experiments. Our studies of this unique host-parasite system are among the first of their kind and will provide foundational data and resources for future studies.\n(c) In addition, the isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understating of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology.

            "task_progress": "Whereas previous spaceflight experiments in model organisms – such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and in humans – have shown that the immune system function in space is compromised, similar studies examining the immune system’s interaction with natural pathogens and parasites in space have not been undertaken. With increased investments and opportunities in spaceflight, space travel by humans is becoming more frequent and will even be the norm in the years to come. In this context, it is important to ask how spaceflight affects natural pathogens and parasites in model organisms and in human hosts, especially if the hosts have dysfunctional immunity or are immune-compromised. To address this question, we examined the effects of spaceflight in Drosophila melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to-and-back from the International Space Station, aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission in the spring of 2018.\nParasitoid wasps are obligate parasites of their insect hosts. Most parasitoid wasps of Drosophila attack larval stages of fruit flies and consume the developing host, while growing inside its body. A normal immune response to wasp attack consists of the so-called encapsulation response in which dozens of differentiated blood cells or hemocytes migrate toward the egg to tightly encase, melanize, and kill it. Parasitoid wasps produce factors in their venom to disrupt this immune reaction to ensure their success.\nThe experimental design of our project consisted of two host strains, tumor-free flies with normal immunity (control flies), and mutant flies with chronic inflammatory tumors, due to hyperactive immunity (CI flies). Each of these hosts was infected by either of two wasp species (fly-host co-cultures), that differ in their infection strategies. One wasp species modifies the shapes of hemocytes, whereas the other kills hemocytes, to block encapsulation and gain control over the host. Hemocytes fight off wasp infections by making up the wasp capsules. Parasite-free flies (fly-only cultures) were also included in the experiments as controls.\nWe examined (a) the relative success of hosts versus parasites, (b) the effects of spaceflight on the immune physiology of Drosophila hosts, and (c) the effects of spaceflight on parasite virulence itself. We also searched for the detrimental effects of space radiation on wasp morphology. Using physiological, cellular, and molecular readouts of the space-returned animals and their corresponding ground controls, we found:\n(a) Fewer than expected control flies returned to Earth, while the tumor-bearing CI flies succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. Thus, tumor-free control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight conditions than CI flies. This result is counter-intuitive and unexpected. Molecular analysis revealed that in the tumor-free control flies (but not in the mutant CI flies), many genes important for essential life functions were downregulated. Furthermore, the orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. In both fly strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins), that contribute to cuticle and chorion structures, were strongly affected in space.\n(b) Spaceflight spiked the expression of inflammation genes in fruit flies of both control and CI strains; space travel enhanced tumor growth in tumor-bearing flies; larval progeny of these ‘space’ flies showed a higher tumor burden and were more strongly immune reactive than ‘ground’ controls. In addition, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains and even though the control flies did not develop tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased.\n(c) Surprisingly, spaceflight did not significantly affect parasitic wasp development, or their emergence. In addition, the effects on the expression of virulence genes was also not significant. In one of the two wasp species, virulence particles were seen normally distributed within the hosts. Together these results suggest that the effects of the space stressors on the parasite, that develops within the fly host, are quite modest.\n(d) Orbiting ~400 kilometer above Earth, life in the International Space Station is subjected to somewhat higher levels of space radiation than organisms on Earth are. In this research project, we identified two parasite mutants of one of the two wasp species. These mutants show defects in wing color, wing shape, and ovipositor morphology. To identify these mutants, we examined the grandsons of the male wasps born in space. A mutant that affects wing color (aurum, for golden wings, instead of the normal grey wings) breeds true, while the other mutant in which wing shape is affected (kona, angular wing shape relative to the normal round edge), cannot lay eggs in hosts due to structural defects in the ovipositor. These genetic variants are the only live mutant strains for this class of parasites and will be useful for research on host-parasite interaction studies on Earth.  Pathogens and parasites pose a threat to human and animal health during spaceflight. Our studies reveal the unique and shared effects of spaceflight on the physiology and gene expression on distinct strains of Drosophila hosts. They show that metazoan parasites retain their infection strategies in space and highlight the resilience of parasite development in the space environment. Continued analysis of such systems, using model hosts and their various parasites, will help establish multigenerational studies and obtain a fine-grained understanding of the long-term effects of space on diverse organisms.",

            "task_description": "The GeneLab data repository is a powerful resource with which to dissect plant responses to spaceflight at the molecular and genetic level. The research in this GeneLab Innovation study has therefore sought to continue and extend our current analysis of the GeneLab plant science data through bioinformatics, experimental tests of predictions, and development of approaches to facilitate data exploration and rapid sharing of analytical tools. This work directly addresses Goal 1 of the Space Biology program by creating ‘new knowledge of how biological systems adapt to space.’ In addition, this research approaches some of GeneLab’s guiding questions as to how implementation of large scale dataset analyses can help produce new insights and hypotheses about the effects of spaceflight on biological systems.\nAim (1): We have been using informatics to ask how spaceflight alters the plant transcriptome and proteome using GeneLab data. We have then compared these changes to responses to other stresses and environments, (e.g., pathogen attack or oxidative stress) where large-scale, publicly available datasets have already been deposited outside of GeneLab. These datasets include responses to partial gravity and gravitropism-related transcriptomes. For example, our analysis of Arabidopsis data from the BRIC (Biological Research in Canisters), EMCS (European Modular Cultivation System), and APEX (Advanced Plant Experiment) experiments has revealed oxidative stress and hypoxia as major flight-related stresses and has targeted gene families ranging from heat-shock proteins to cell wall peroxidases as likely key players in this spaceflight response network. The more comprehensive analysis possible with the bioinformatic tools generated in this innovation study have greatly expanded the range of molecular mechanisms we can detect.\nAim (2): The second element of the work has been to take the genes defined from the bioinformatics in Aim 1 and test their function by using mutants in these genes and assessing their responses to a suite of phenotypic assays including: morphometric measurements of gravtiropic and clinostat growth in short and long-term hypoxia and flooding and mechanical stimulation. Inferences from these growth analyses have been compared to those revealed by quantitative PCR results of marker genes identified from the core spaceflight, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and gravitropism transcriptomic analyses.\nAim (3): GeneLab datasets also offer the opportunity to address the key challenge of facilitating exploration of these large, complex, and specialized datasets by non-specialists. We have developed a database/exploration environment, the TOAST (Test Of All Space Transcriptomes) database, aimed at increasing such accessibility for the non-specialist. This system uses the Qlik database management software and offers a highly interactive data visualization toolset that allows non-expert users to search across, and explore interconnections within, large and complex datasets.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is leading to benefits outside of the spaceflight arena at two levels: (1) tool development and (2) extension of basic knowledge of plant stress responses.\nAt the level of tool development, we have generated a large dataset exploration environment built around the Qlik data visualization toolset. This tool allows rapid comparison and exploration between large-scale ‘omics-level datasets, facilitating comparison between transcriptomics/gene expression data and then cross-comparisons to protein-level data such as proteomics analyses. Although focused on spaceflight data within GeneLab’s data repository, this architecture is applicable to wider experimental datasets. In parallel we have also been developing gas regulation chambers to allow analysis of plant growth and molecular phenotypes related to lowered oxygen availability. Although again focused on spaceflight-related events of lowered oxygen levels, these devices are also applicable to studying the effects of ground-based phenomena such as flooding effects on plant biology.\nOur analyses of phenotypes has also extended basic understanding on plant responses to touch, low oxygen levels, and oxidative stress signaling on Earth. For example, we have been able to define an array of genes that when mutated alter responses to oxidative stress on Earth. Oxidative stress is a major element of stress signaling and resistance pathways and so this basic understanding is expanding our broad knowledge of how plants are able to respond to less than optimal environmental conditions."

            "task_progress": "Bioinformatics tool development:\nWe have developed, and now deployed, a database and exploration environment for mining the publicly available spaceflight plant biology data called the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptomes, or TOAST, database. This system is built around the Qlik data visualization software. Thus, we have imported all the GeneLab plant biology data alongside publicly available datasets from US, European, and Chinese researchers into the TOAST database. We have also imported publicly available datasets related to spaceflight-associated stresses including: oxidative stress, responses to growth on the clinostat or during magnetic levitation, and radiation exposure, to help make comparisons to the spaceflight datasets. We have applied a minimal requirement of 3 independent biological replicates for each study allowing for the calculation of statistical significance of any changes seen (P- and Q-values). This has meant the database covers a wide range of studies on Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.\nThe database was tested in a public beta-test over 2018-2019 leading to improvements in the user interface, increases in the stability and improvements in the sets of analytical tools available. The database is now in version 4.6 and is publicly available at\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast\n. Alongside the database an online tutorial has been developed (\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata\n) to aid users in getting started with the system. A manuscript describing the use of the database has also been published in Frontiers in Plant Science.\nAlongside the TOAST database, a Meta data app has also been deployed to allow a deeper analysis of the available plant spaceflight data. Thus, the meta data associated with each dataset within the TOAST database has been manually curated and imported into an allied Qlik-based database. This approach allows searching of the linked experimental elements such as growth hardware, type of spaceflight, and lighting system used to allow the user to ask which experiments share similar conditions, or to try to understand how the experiments they are analyzing are different. The metadata app is publicly available at:\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata\n.\nMutant analyses:\nAn additional goal for this work has been to use phenotyping of mutants in the genes identified as showing strong links to spaceflight-related events from the TOAST-based analysis described above. This phenotyping is being used to ask how well TOAST generates reliable and testable hypotheses about plant responses to spaceflight. Gravitropism, reaction to hypoxia, and response to oxidative stress are all closely linked to spaceflight-related conditions due to spaceflight’s disruption in normal plant gravity signaling, reduced availability of oxygen from the lack of convective mixing of gasses in space, and high oxidative loads due to a general background of spaceflight-related stress. These responses have therefore been used to screen the mutants for phenotypes. Analysis using the TOAST database has identified a suite of genes related to oxidative stress such as Heat Shock Proteins (chaperones) and the ROS (reactive oxygen species) producing enzymes such as the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, or RBOHs as likely key players in spaceflight stress responses. Phenotyping mutants in these genes has revealed unexpected linkages to spaceflight-related stresses, such as a role for heat shock proteins in gravitropism and the RBOHs in a broad suite of spaceflight effects from flooding to mechanical responses.\nTOAST as an educational tool:\nIn addition to a research discovery tool, the TOAST database has also been tested in the educational setting. For example, TOAST has been used in the classroom in Verona and Oregon High Schools in WI, where students went through the process of data analysis, gene discovery, and hypothesis generation. In addition, TOAST has been incorporated into an undergraduate class experience at Carthage College, a 4 year liberal arts college in WI. In collaboration with Dr. Andrea Henle, TOAST analyses were incorporated into her Astrobiology undergraduate class with the goal of leading the students through an authentic research experience, discovering new genes related to spaceflight response in Arabidopsis and then testing these hypotheses with gravitropism assays on mutants in the selected genes.\nAt UWisconsin-Madison, the Principal Investigator (PI) also maintains a “Collaboratory” where biology and engineering undergraduates and high school students come together to develop plant phenotyping equipment and other hardware relevant to our spaceflight-related work. There are generally 10-15 students working on various plant molecular and engineering projects related to space biology and GeneLab with a practical lab course called AstroBotanical Engineering being offered ~each semester. These students have been helping develop the TOAST database interface, using TOAST to analyze spaceflight and related plant datasets, and working on the phenotyping pipelines to test the predictions made through using the GeneLab analyses from the TOAST database.",

            "task_description": "Spaceflight, by altering the differentiation program of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells residing within bone marrow, results in bone loss, increased bone marrow adiposity, anemia, and impaired immune function. These closely associated disturbances may compromise the success of long-term missions. Thus, there exists an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and implement effective countermeasures. Mice are currently the preferred animal model for evaluating adaptive responses to microgravity experienced during spaceflight and simulated spaceflight (e.g., hindlimb unloading). Mice have important advantages over other animal models for spaceflight studies, including small size and ease of genetic manipulation. Although mice and humans share many common characteristics, fundamental species differences in thermoregulation may contraindicate the mouse, as currently applied, as a model for human spaceflight.\nHumans are homeotherms and when exposed to a cold environment defend their core body temperature, whereas mice are obligatory daily heterotherms and experience cyclic changes in core temperature when subjected to cold stress (i.e., temperature below thermoneutral). Mice are typically housed at or near room temperature (~22°C), which is well below the thermoneutral zone for the species (~32°C). Therefore, mice must expend energy to maintain core body temperature. Cold stress induced by sub-thermoneutral housing increases sympathetic outflow to peripheral tissues, including brown adipose tissue, and has profound effects on metabolism. We have recently shown that cold stress induced by room temperature housing results in rapid cancellous bone loss in mice. Based on this finding, we hypothesize that activation of adaptive thermogenesis in mice housed at room temperature introduces unrecognized and uncontrolled confounding variables into mouse studies. Strategies used by weight-bearing mice to minimize heat loss during room temperature housing (e.g., huddling or postural adjustments) are less effective during spaceflight and simulated spaceflight. This results in increased dependence on adaptive thermogenesis, likely exaggerating the negative physiological effects of skeletal unloading on bone and immune cells. Additionally, the thermogenic mechanisms mediating cold stress-induced changes in metabolism in mice are unlikely to be directly translatable to astronauts and could therefore confound interpretation of experimental results as applicable to humans.\nThis proposal will explore the individual and combined effects of mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing and hindlimb unloading (HLU) on the skeleton in C57BL6 (B6) mice, a strain commonly used in spaceflight and HLU studies. To accomplish our goal, we propose 2 Specific Aims:\nSpecific Aim 1: Determine the contribution of increased adaptive thermogenesis to bone loss during HLU in mice housed at room temperature.\nWe will accomplish this aim by comparing HLU-induced bone loss in mice housed at room temperature (22°C) with mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C).\nSpecific Aim 2: Determine the lowest sub-thermoneutral housing temperature able to prevent adaptive thermogenesis-associated bone loss.\nWe will accomplish this aim by performing temperature response studies (20-32°C) to evaluate induction of adaptive thermogenesis. Once we identify the lowest sub-thermoneutral housing temperature that does not induce adaptive thermogenesis, we will perform a long-term study to verify that minimal premature bone loss occurs and that magnitude of HLU-induced bone loss does not differ from mice housed at thermoneutral.\nSuccessful completion of the proposed research will provide guidance to investigators for insuring housing conditions minimize the confounding effects of species-specific differences in thermoregulation on experimental outcomes with the ultimate goal of optimizing the mouse to model human responses to spaceflight.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "One of our goals is to establish mouse models that more accurately replicate human physiology.  Mice, because of their small size, short lifespan, and ease of genetic manipulation, are a mainstay for cutting edge research in fundamental skeletal biology, and are increasingly being used as preclinical models for skeletal disuse and metabolic bone disease.  There is, however, a critical need to identify and address major limitations of mice as models for human physiology.  For example, in contrast to humans, mice experience bone- and bone compartment-specific cancellous bone loss while growing.  This premature age-related bone loss is a concern because the most common metabolic bone diseases preferentially target the aged or during conditions such as long duration spaceflight believed to accelerate aging.  An important difference between mouse and human physiology that may contribute to premature age-related bone loss is the tight coupling of bone metabolism to thermoregulation in mice.  If our hypothesis is correct, mild temperature stress induced by room temperature housing is responsible for premature cancellous bone loss in mice and factors that influence thermoregulation in mice may further compromise studies designed to model human responses by independently altering bone metabolism."

            "task_progress": "Progress on Specific Aim 1: Determine the contribution of increased adaptive thermogenesis to bone loss during HLU in mice housed at room temperature. We evaluated the impact of housing temperature on skeletal responses to HLU. The findings described below demonstrate remarkable differences in bone and immune response to HLU between growing mice housed at 22°C and those housed at 32°C.\nImmune response: For this, we evaluated immune cell subtypes in the spleen and carried out ex vivo stimulation of splenocytes with media control, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), concanavalin A (ConA), and anti- CD3/CD28 to induce cell proliferation and cytokine production. Production of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines were measured (IL10, IL17, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha), Interferon-gamma (IFNG), IL 6, IL 4, and IL 2).\nWe detected IL 2, IFNG, and IL6. For each of these cytokines, cold stress induced by room temperature housing exaggerated the immune cell response to a T- cell mitogen following HLU. These data will be included in a future publication.\nBone mass and microarchitecture: The femur is an important weight bearing bone that is unloaded during HLU. We evaluated the effects of HLU on total femur and cancellous bone volume fraction in the distal femur metaphysis in growing female mice housed at 22°C and mice housed at 32°C. Compared to baseline, HLU resulted in lower total femur bone volume in mice housed at either temperature, but the reduction was ~2 fold greater (22 % versus 10 %) in mice housed at 22°C. The influence of housing temperature on cancellous bone response to HLU was even more profound. HLU resulted in relative osteopenia at the distal femur metaphysis in mice housed at 32°C by preventing bone accrual. This finding is in marked contrast to mice housed at 22°C, where the weight bearing controls failed to accrue additional bone and HLU mice lost cancellous bone.\nThe humerus is a weight bearing bone in the mouse. The femur is unloaded during HLU but the humerus should be subjected to near normal loading. Compared to baseline, HLU had minimal effect on total humerus bone volume in female mice housed at 32°C (-3% change), but resulted in bone loss in mice housed at 22°C (-11% change). These findings support the concept that factors in addition to reduced weight bearing contribute to bone loss in HLU mice housed at 22°C. Studies evaluating the impact of room temperature induced cold stress on skeletal response to HLU on growing mice are published. Similar studies in skeletally mature mice housed at room temperature and thermoneutral have been completed and we are now in the process of manuscript preparation.\nWe performed studies to further define the time course for bone loss in mice housed at room temperature. Importantly, transferring mice to thermoneutral prevents additional bone loss but does not restore bone that had been lost during room temperature housing. Consequently, to prevent cold temperature induced bone changes, it is important to begin housing mice at thermoneutral as early as possible.\nWe initiated studies to further define the mechanisms mediating premature bone loss induced by room temperature housing. Our initial focus was on the role of the sympathetic nervous system. This is because sympathetic outflow is increased at sub-thermoneutral temperatures. In the study summarized below, we evaluated the effect of the ß-blocker propranolol on the skeleton in female B6 mice housed at room temperature (22°C) and thermoneutral (32°C). The work is complete, and a manuscript published.   Progress on Specific Aim 2: Determine the lowest sub-thermoneutral housing temperature able to prevent adaptive thermogenesis-associated bone loss.\nWe proposed to accomplish this aim by performing temperature response studies (20°C to 32°C) to measure adaptive thermogenesis as a function of housing temperature (Sub-Aim 1). Once we identified the lowest sub-thermoneutral housing temperature that does not induce adaptive thermogenesis and premature bone loss, we proposed to perform a long-duration study to verify that the magnitude of HLU-induced bone loss in mice housed at this temperature does not differ from mice housed at thermoneutral (Sub-Aim 2).   We previously reported that the premature (prior to cessation of growth) cancellous bone loss in female B6 mice housed conventionally (room temperature) was prevented when the mice were housed at thermoneutral (32°C). We performed additional studies to determine whether these findings apply to males. Specifically, we compared growing mice housed at room temperature (22°C) to mice housed at 32°C. The work is complete, and a manuscript published.\nWe performed a serious of studies to establish the lowest sub-thermoneutral housing temperature able to prevent adaptive thermogenesis-associated bone loss., including a long duration study where male and female growing mice were housed at either 22°C or 26°C until adulthood. We chose 26°C because this is the highest temperature recommended in animal care and use guidelines. We have completed collection of data related to energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide emission, respiratory exchange ratio, food consumption, and distance traveled, and are preparing a publication. Additionally, we analyzed bone mass, density, and microarchitecture. The data clearly indicate that housing mice at 26°C modestly reduced but did not prevent adaptive thermogenesis or premature bone loss. Compared to either baseline or mice housed at 32°C, housing male mice at 26°C marginally reduced premature cancellous bone loss. Similarly, bone loss was reduced but not prevented in female mice housed at 26°C. However, it is important to note that a 4°C difference in housing temperature was sufficient to significantly alter cancellous bone volume fraction in growing male and female B6 mice. In addition, we have performed analysis of brown and white adipose tissue of mice flown and sacrificed aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The results support our hypothesis that non-shivering thermogenesis is increased aboard the ISS. A manuscript describing this research is published.\nCOVID-19 delayed our progress on the funded proposal. However, it provided us an opportunity to evaluate archival tissue and unpublished data to explore generalizability of published results and test a novel hypothesis. In the first case, we evaluated the effects of spaceflight on the femoral head using tissue from two (2) space shuttle experiments. This manuscript is now published. In the second case, we used unpublished data from numerous spaceflight and ground-based studies to test the gravitostat hypothesis for weight control. This manuscript is now published. In the third case, Nrf2 signaling has been implicated in mediating some of the detrimental effects of microgravity on the musculoskeletal system. We therefore participated in a collaborative study evaluating bone from mice in which Nrf2 was deleted. This manuscript is now published.\nSummary (Interpretation) of Results\nSpecific Aim 1: We have strong evidence that adaptation to cold stress is responsible for ~50% of bone loss in the femur of growing HLU mice. When we consider the cancellous compartment, the impact of housing temperature is even more striking; HLU prevented bone accrual at 32°C and resulted in bone loss at 22°C. In contrast, HLU prevented bone accrual in mice housed at 32°C but did not induce cancellous bone loss. Even more striking was our finding that HLU-induced bone loss in humerus, a bone subjected to near normal weight bearing in the HLU model. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that adaptation to cold stress induced by room temperature housing is an important modifier of the skeletal response to HLU in mice. In addition, analyses of splenocytes suggest that increased cytokine secretion may contribute to excess bone loss induced by HLU in growing room temperature housed mice. We have extended these studies to skeletally mature mice, which show similarly dramatic housing temperature associated differences in response to HLU. We are in the process of preparing these data for publication.\nSpecific Aim 2: Room temperature housing-induced premature cancellous bone loss in growing mice is not sex specific; although male mice have higher peak bone mass, the magnitude of bone loss in room temperature housed mice did not differ between male and female mice. Housing mice at 26°C reduced, but did not prevent, premature cancellous bone loss in either male or female growing mice. However, the observed differences between mice housed at 22°C and 26°C indicate that even small differences in housing temperature influence bone mass in growing mice.",

            "task_description": "As NASA pursues its goal of sending human colonies to Mars and beyond, there is a pressing need to better understand how the spaceflight environment influences fundamental biological processes. Understanding how plants respond to gravity on Earth and the microgravity environment in space is of particular interest because of the important role that plants will play in advanced bioregenerative life support systems during long duration space missions. In recent years, numerous transcriptomic datasets have shown that hundreds of genes change expression when plants are grown in space. However, it has been challenging to tease apart which genes change due to microgravity from those that change as a result of general plant stress responses. This difficulty stems from the fact that plant spaceflight genomics datasets have been derived almost exclusively from whole seedlings and plant organs, which could potentially mask or dilute gene expression changes that are occurring within the distinct cell-types that are responsible for gravity sensing (e.g., root columella and stem endodermal cells). Thus, the major goal of this NASA-ground-based proposal is to begin to take steps to develop methodology that will enable space genomic studies on homogenous cell populations. Here, we propose to use laser capture microdissection (LCM) to conduct RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) on gravity sensing columella cells to identify gene regulatory networks that govern early responses of plants to gravity. We hypothesize that gene profile signatures from a homogenous population of columella cells will more clearly reflect transcriptomic changes that are directly linked to microgravity. The RNA-Seq data that we obtain from our analysis of root columella cells will be compared to columella-specific gene modules we identified through our Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) of Arabidopsis seedlings grown for 6 and 11 days on the International Space Station (ISS) (specific aim 2). In parallel, we will refine LCM methods with the goal of implementing them for future plant spaceflight genomics (specific aim 1). The latter aim will involve ground-based experiments in which specific steps in the LCM methods will be modified to mirror in-orbit operations.\nUpon successful completion of this proposal, we expect to generate new tools for conducting genomics in homogenous plant cell populations that will enable us to better differentiate microgravity effects from microgravity independent effects.\nNOTE September 2021: The Principal Investigator (PI) (Blancaflor) and Co-Is (Tang and Kwon) ended their employment at the Noble Research Institute  as a result of the Noble Research Institute's decision to terminate basic plant science research. Therefore, on March 2021, a request was made to NASA to transfer remaining work on this grant to Dr. Simon Gilroy at the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Gilroy will be new PI for this work.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research seeks to fill technological gaps that will enable a better understanding of how plants develop in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. The focus of this research is to develop methods that will allow us to learn more about how expression of genes within specific root cell types change under microgravity or stress-induced spaceflight. The plant organ of interest in this proposal is the root. Because roots are crucial for uptake of water and nutrients to support optimal plant growth, results from this proposal will benefit agriculture on Earth. We expect that genes, which show cell-type expression changes in response to gravity could be potential targets for pre-breeding efforts toward developing crop cultivars that are resilient to environmental stress imposed by marginal lands on Earth and confined growth environments during spaceflight."

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORTING AUGUST 2021\nAlthough progress was made on with this proposal, it was limited because of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and closure of the PI's laboratory at the Noble Research Institute. Below we summarize progress thus far.\nA.\tRoot Cap Harvest of Maize Seedlings as Alternative Experiments to Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM)\nThe maize root cap functions as the site of gravity sensing with columella cells that contain amyloplasts that sediment according to the gravity vector. The maize root has a closed type with a clear demarcation boundary between the root cap and the root proper. As such, the root cap can be easily removed. We were able to manually excise the root caps with a scalpel without the aid of a microscope as the root cap was less opaque. We completed the harvest of five biological replicates of Zea mays B73 root caps for our experiment in late January 2021. The RNA integrity number (RIN) based on Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) readings of harvested root cap total RNA were highly satisfactory, ranging from 7-9.6, with concentrations averaging at 15 ng/ul. By using this technique in favor of  laser capture microdissection (LCM), we were able to expand our time series to five time points (5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours after reorienting the root) that relate to important biological responses that included gravity perception, gravity signal transduction and root growth response. In contrast, the LCM technique would have limited us to three time points as this sampling technique is time consuming and laborious. Furthermore, access to the LCM at Noble was limited due to precautions with COVID-19. Whilst enriching for columella cells by harvesting the root cap is less precise than LCM, we expect that the high population of columella cells in the root cap will generate results that are specific enough to columella cell signatures. Three biological replicates of 100 ng root cap total RNA with satisfactory RIN and concentrations were selected for the cDNA library construction.  cDNA library was sequenced at 150 base paired reads on Illumina Novaseq S4 at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK.\nB.\tDifferential Gene Expression in Maize Root Caps at Various Time Points After Gravistimulation\nRNA-seq raw reads were aligned to B73 genome (AGPv2) using HiSat2 alignment. The read counts for each gene were based on Zea mays B73 NAM genome version 5 using HTSeq-count tool  that processes the counts for differential expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analysed based on differences between control and gravistimulated roots using DESeq2  and Limma-voom  on the integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis (iDEP) platform. Currently, there is no consensus on the softwares used for RNA-Seq analysis. As such, we explored both DESeq2 and Limma-voom to compare the overlapping DEGs. We have also tested the pseudoaligment tool, Kallisto, and its accompanying DEG analysis tool, Sleuth, but as this technique did not yield overlapping DEGs with DESeq2 and Limma-voom, this is not discussed here.\nWe interrogated our data structure based on gene counts output from HT-Seq-count using principal component analysis (PCA). We found that our data can be grouped based on the treatment factor, i.e., control or gravistimulated. Notably, 19% (PC2) of our data is statistically significantly correlated to the treatment factor. DESeq2 analysis was set to 2-fold change threshold with a 0.1 false discovery rate cutoff revealed 84 DEGs at 30 minutes and 45 DEGs at 2 hours. On the other hand, Limma-voom analysis using the same 2-fold change threshold and 0.1 FDR cutoff displayed 103 DEGs. To narrow down our list of gene candidates, we focused on DEGs that overlapped between DESeq2 and Limma-voom and reduced the number of DEGs obtained from DESeq2 by restricting the fold change threshold to 4. Next, we cross-referenced the list of 74 DEGs from DESeq2 with the 103 DEGs from Limma-voom analysis and found 19 corroborating DEGs. In this group of 19 genes, nine were mostly upregulated throughout the five time points, and the remaining ten were mostly downregulated. In the group of genes that were upregulated, there was an interesting trend whereby genes that were initially upregulated at 5 minutes showed reduced expression at 10 minutes. Gene expression trends from DESeq2 analysis will be further verified by a selection of genes for quantitative (q) reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We have selected seven genes from this list of 19 overlapping genes  and included additional seven genes based on their postulated function that showed differential expression in DESeq2 analysis. Genes that were of interest have plausible functions pertaining to gravity reorientation growth, such as ion channels for the transduction of gravity signal, metabolism relating to glucogenesis and respiration to power growth, cell wall and cytoskeleton related to orchestrate changes in cell shape for growth and hormone biosynthesis that includes auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin.\nNOTE: The PI (Blancaflor) and Co-Is (Tang and Kwon) ended their employment at the Noble Research Institute  as a result of the Noble Research Institute's decision to terminate basic plant science research. Therefore, on March 2021, a request was made to NASA to transfer remaining work on this grant to Dr. Simon Gilroy at the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Gilroy will be new PI for this work. See that project, “Leveraging Spaceflight Genomic Data to Uncover Developmental and Cell Type Specific Gene Regulatory Networks in Plants Responding to Gravity (PI: Gilroy)” for future reporting.\nANNUAL REPORTING NOVEMBER 2020\nImpact of COVID-19 on Task Progress\nOur progress for this reporting period was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 19, 2020, 90% of Noble Research Institute employees were required to work from home to minimize the spread of the virus. The 10% allowed to work on-campus were limited to essential personnel and did not include the Principal Investigator (PI), Co-Is, and postdoctoral fellow. On June 15, 2020, 50% of employees were allowed to return to campus and such restrictions continue to date because of the on-going threat of the disease. During this phase in which 50% of employees are allowed on-campus, personnel involved in this project have limited access to laboratory facilities. This allowed  progress in accomplishing  specific aims of the project, but as noted below, achieving such progress required us to consider alternative experiments.\nGene Expression Changes in Specific Gravity Sensing Cells of Roots\nPrior to campus closure in March, we managed to evaluate RNA integrity numbers (RINs) from maize columella cells harvested using laser capture microdissection (LCM). RIN is an indicator of the quality of RNA for planned gene expression studies. Unfortunately, the RNA yield and quality from these samples were poor and we were unable to optimize due to COVID-19-related campus closure. The LCM protocols proposed in the original proposal are technically demanding, and require long hours of trouble shooting in the laboratory. Because of campus closure and limited access to the LCM instrument, we decided to pursue a different approach in obtaining cell-type specific transcripts that are differentially regulated by gravity. This approach involved dissecting root caps from maize roots. The experimental approach involved  mounting 3-day-old maize (B73 cultivar) seedlings on large square Petri plates lined with moist germination paper so their roots were vertical. After allowing roots to grow vertically for one hour, half of the plates were kept vertical while the other half were rotated by 90 degrees. 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h after plates were rotated, the tips of 30-35 roots were cut and immediately immersed in RNA Later to preserve RNA. Each gravistimulated time point had its own vertical control. After two hours of incubation in RNA Later, root caps were individually dissected and transferred to a new set of microfuge tubes containing RNA lysis buffer to break open the cells in the harvested root caps. RNA was extracted using a commercially available kit. We found that RNA yield and quality from the harvested root caps was sufficient to begin constructing a library for RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) needed for gene expression studies.\nOne of advantages of harvesting root caps instead of LCM-derived columella sections is that we were able to expand our sampling time points to five time points that corresponded to gravity perception, gravity signal transduction, and growth response stages. This will enable us to perform hierarchical clustering of genes that are differentially expressed at these times. In addition, we anticipate that this technique is more applicable for future spaceflight experiments, whereby astronauts can harvest root segments containing the root cap into RNA later for further root cap processing on the ground.\nAlthough our efforts during the past 4-5 months have shifted from LCM-isolated maize columella to entire root caps, we still plan to revisit the LCM approach once COVID-19 crisis allows better access to facilities. One specific strategy that we envision to make up for lost time is to validate differentially regulated transcripts from RNA-Seq of harvested maize root caps described above in LCM-dissected columella cells using real-time quantitative-real time RT-PCR. We expect that several transcripts that are differentially regulated by gravistimulation would be specifically expressed in the columella.   \t    \t  Cell-Type Specific Expression of Cytosolic Calcium Reporters in Arabidopsis thaliana Roots\nFor this reporting period, we addressed other research questions that fall within the general theme of cell-type specific responses to gravity. To this end, we evaluated lines of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, that were previously engineered to express a fluorescent cytoplasmic calcium reporter called GCaMP3. Expression of CGaMP3 and other genetically-encoded cytoplasmic calcium sensors in plants are driven by promoters that are expressed throughout the entire plant. These plant lines expressing cytoplasmic calcium sensors in all cell types enable studies of cytoplasmic calcium changes across entire plant organs. However, it is likely that each cell type within the organ is characterized by a unique calcium response. Having lines that express cytoplasmic calcium reporters in specific cell-types would be of particular value to studies of plant gravity responses. Notably, lines that express such reporters in the columella and endodermis, which are widely accepted to be the major gravity sensing cells in roots and shoots, respectively,  would enable studies that can identify physiological responses that are due primarily to gravity.\nThese columella- and endodermis-specific GCaMP3 lines were published recently. They could potentially be used to evaluate calcium signaling events in microgravity using either the light microscopy module or the spectrum imager on the International Space Station.",

Sloan Foundation, as a result of a Space Act Agreement between NASA and the Sloan Foundation, for Collaborative Research Proposal for Microbiology of the Built Environment (MoBE). The purpose of this Space Act Agreement is to enhance the ability of NASA and the Sloan Foundation to support scientific research and the dissemination of information about the effect of spaceflight on microbial ecosystems in spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) through sponsorship of postdoctoral fellowships. NASA is providing the isolates for all studies.\nCorrosion represents a significant cost to the global economy, representing up to 6% of US GDP. An unknown percentage of this corrosion is due to the interaction of microorganisms and materials resulting in microbially influenced corrosion (MIC). Microorganisms capable of MIC are phylogenetically diverse, and found in a broad diversity of environments. The International Space Station (ISS) is no different than many Earth-bound built environments and the potential exists that corrosive organisms are present on the ISS or any other spaceflight system. Broadly this proposal seeks to characterize the expansive set of microbial isolates obtained from the ISS over the past 15 years using a combination of physical, microscopic, and electrochemical means to understand the capability and rates of MIC from space-adapted microorganisms.\nConcurrently isolates will also be assessed for their ability to degrade polymeric coatings, specifically polyurethane (PU). Coatings are at risk for microbial degradation and may then expose metallic surfaces for additional corrosion. Again, microorganisms from the ISS culture collection will be used to determine the risk of biodegradation using a PU analog, Impranil. Finally, to understand if isolates have obtained any differential ability to corrode or degrade coatings near relatives will be purchased from culture collections and assessed for their ability to corrode metallic surfaces and degrade PU. The results will be used to direct detection and mitigation efforts on future spaceflight systems and ensure the reliability and safety of human inhabited spaceflight vehicles in the years to come.",

            "task_progress": "The funding graciously provided by the Sloan Foundation was split between two major microbial activities that may impact materials on the International Space Station (ISS)-biodegradation and biocorrosion. The proposed work began October 1, 2017 and concluded fall 2019. I now have a research scientist position with UES, Inc., the primary contractor for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in Dayton, Ohio. Our plan was ambitious, and despite the slightly truncated timeline major activities were completed through the funded period. This report summarizes major accomplishments and work remaining to complete.\nA total of 120 microbial cultures were obtained from NASA that were successfully propagated and maintained over the fellowship. Of the 120 tested isolates 35 displayed some amount or capability of polyurethane degradation with three showing the greatest amounts of polymer degradation potential. To further link the observed phenotype to a genotype that could be useful to NASA, 14 isolates were selected for DNA sequencing. DNA was extracted from a pellet of cell mass preserved from the initial culture received from NASA, and both Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing were performed. Final annotation is underway and we expect to release the data publicly alongside the manuscript in preparation in late Spring 2020.\nIn January 2019 a large-scale corrosion test was begun to compliment the biodegradation work. Originally two time points were planned, and two materials (stainless steel and Al2024 aluminum). Final results are pending, but initial corrosion calculations suggest differences of over an order of magnitude exist between the highest corroders and sterile controls, although all conditions are considered low corrosion risk (<1 mil per year, or MPY), though these risk estimates are for oil and gas pipelines, not spacecraft. Work continues in collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory to bring the story to a close.\nThrough new and existing collaborations at AFRL, I was able to secure imaging and profilometry of approximately 100 aluminum coupons, including both culture exposed and controls. This represents over 500 hours of instrument and technician time that I will leverage at no cost to bring an extremely high-resolution understanding of the corrosion dynamics of ISS built-environment isolates. Three coupons from each culture and control condition were chosen based on maximum corrosion rates to provide the most extreme examples of potential surface pitting. While we were unable to complete additional experimentation using stainless steel, or investigate possible differences in corrosion via electrochemical corrosion cells as originally planned, the work still stands to contribute significantly to our understanding of common skin and built- environment associated microorganisms and their impact on materials corrosion and biodegradation of the ISS built environment.\nThe fellowship has also allowed me to complete multiple manuscripts, with more in preparation, including the built environment of the Orange County Water District as well as multiple studies focused on geomicrobiology including Mono Lake, California. Another was the result of interactions with a fellow postdoctoral fellow at the Colorado School of Mines, and another the culmination of an intense built-environment collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory. I was also fortunate enough to mentor several graduate students during my time at Colorado School of Mines – I am a co-author on one student’s manuscript. I was able to complete five (two first author, three co-authored) manuscripts as a result of this fellowship, and after final publication, the fellowship will have directly resulted in two first-authored, two other first-authored, and numerous co-authored manuscripts that would not have been possible without the support of the Sloan Foundation.\n[Ed. note 4/13/2020: compiled from PI's final report submitted to the Sloan Foundation]",

Statolith sedimentation in specialized cells represents one way that plants perceive gravity. Plants lacking functional statoliths show reduced but consistent gravity responses, suggesting the presence of a non-statolith sensory system. This proposal seeks to investigate the gravity perception machinery in roots of several genotypes of the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana by taking advantage of the unique microgravity environment of Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS). One thrust of the work described here is to characterize the physiological properties of the putative non-statolith sensory system, including the threshold acceleration force required to activate it, and its capacity to modulate downstream growth regulation machinery. The second thrust is to determine whether the two gravity sensory systems control a single or multiple output systems. Addressing this question requires the microgravity environment in order to quantify the kinetics of gravitropism in roots having or lacking functional statoliths under fractional g conditions. The overall outcome of the work proposed here will be an improved understanding of how higher plants perceive gravity and transduce this physical cue into directional growth, a fundamental requirement for improving plants for production on Earth and in long-term spaceflight missions.",

He will also help trouble-shoot the system should it be necessary. He will play a major role in data interpretation, data analysis, and data management.

In addition, Mancinelli will take the lead in developing a conceptual model describing the effects of micro-gravity on the growth and development of biofilms as well as for the biofilms grown on metallic inhibitor surfaces.\nTo achieve many of the goals of NASA’s and European Space Agency (ESA)’s space programs requires an enduring human presence in space. Long term human missions require sustained crew health and safety. A research area that is important in sustaining crew health is the development of improved spaceflight-suitable methods for microbiological monitoring, as well as contamination control and reduction. The International Space Station (ISS) is a confined and isolated habitat in an extreme, hostile environment. The human and habitat microflora varies in response to changes in environmental conditions aboard the ISS. Changes in the microflora may result in an increased health risk for the crew. Microorganisms including microbial biofilms have been found on various habitat surfaces, inside the air and water handling systems as well as the hardware used on the ISS. Biofilms are known to cause damage to equipment from polymer deterioration, metal corrosion, and bio-fouling. The primary concern regarding crew health is characterized by activity of opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms that have been noted to accumulate in the closed environments of the ISS and other spacecraft on long-duration missions. Understanding the effects of the space environment, especially altered gravity, on microbial biofilms is crucial for the success of long-term human space missions. Surface-associated biofilm communities were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the ISS. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of human immune function observed during spaceflight. Various studies have shown that certain metals reduce the number of contact-mediated microbial infections. Antimicrobial surfaces are defined as materials that contain an antimicrobial agent (such as silver, copper, and their alloys) that inhibits or reduces the ability of microorganisms to grow on the surface of a material. Antimicrobial surfaces are functionalized in a variety of different processes. The introduction of antimicrobial surfaces for medical, pharmaceutical, and industrial purposes has shown their unique potential for reducing and preventing microbial contamination. The contact killing of several types of microorganisms by copper has been assessed in multiple laboratory in-vitro studies. For sustained crew health and safety additional studies on the mechanisms involved in the formation of microbial biofilms and their efficient destruction under spaceflight conditions, i.e., long-term growth and adaptation to low gravity environments, are needed.\nThe hypothesis to be tested by this project is that surfaces containing copper and/or silver will inhibit biofilm formation under altered gravity regimes to a lesser extent than in 1 x g due to the fact that the interaction with the metal ions on the surface is slower because their movement around the cell is restricted to diffusion. The objective is to determine the effect and the rate, if any, of copper and/or silver surfaces on microbial growth rate, total biomass accumulation, and biofilm formation. The goal is to develop a conceptual model describing the effect of micro-gravity on biofilm formation grown on non-inhibiting surfaces as well as on metal surfaces that are potential biofilm growth inhibitors.\nThe approach will be to test three different microbial model systems (i.e., Escherichia coli K12, a Staphylococcus sp. isolate from the ISS, and the heavy metal resistant strain Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34) for biofilm formation on various copper- and silver-surfaces, as well as inert surfaces as controls. These surfaces differ in their antimicrobial activity based on chemical composition and/or geometric nanostructures. These surfaces will be tested for biofilm formation rates under different spaceflight relevant gravitational regimes (e.g., Moon 0.16 x g, Mars 0.38 x g, µg ISS and 1 x g control). Microbial growth will occur under optimal biofilm-inducing conditions conducted in the KUBIK incubator inside the European Drawer Rack under defined gravitational influences. Biofilm/metal surface samples and controls will be subjected to an intense analysis program, including various microbiological, genetic, molecular biological, chemical, material-science, and structural investigations. The data generated will be of immense importance for understanding the influence of µg and the ISS environment on biofilm formation as well as for the evaluation and production of improved antimicrobial additives, coating, components, surfaces and textiles for short- and long-term utilization for present and future astronaut-/robotic-associated activities in space exploration.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Microbial biofilms are known to cause persistent infections as well as degrade a variety of materials including metals. Biofilms are notorious for their persistence and resistance to eradication.  The use of antimicrobial surfaces provides an alternative strategy for inhibiting microbial growth and biofilm formation to conventional cleaning procedures and the use of disinfectants. Antimicrobial surfaces contain organic or inorganic compounds, such as antimicrobial peptides or copper and silver, that inhibit microbial growth. The objectives of this project include determining the efficacy of biofilm inhibition by different oxidation states of metals and inhibition by nanoscale texture patterns on various metals.  The results from the nano-scale texture patterns represent a new technology that is applicable to inhibiting biofilm formation in hospitals, and also in the pharmaceutical and industries where biofilm corrosion is a problem."

            "task_progress": "BIOFILMS 1:\nThe first flight occurred on Aug 29, 2021 (0714 GMT) with SpaceX CRS-23 (SpX-23). The hardware was successfully loaded into KUBIK and the experiment was conducted successfully. [Ed. Note: KUBIK is a small controlled-temperature incubator or cooler with removable inserts designed for self-contained microgravity experiments. KUBIK is located inside the European Space Agency's Columbus module.] The samples were fixed and returned to Earth.  On October 17, 2021, the samples arrived at the German Space Agency (“Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt” or \"DLR\") and the analysis of the flight samples completed. The preliminary data are similar to that for Biofilms 2 (see below).  Additionally, a postflight debriefing meeting with the European Space Agency (ESA) was held.\nBIOFILMS 2:\nSamples for the BIOFILMS 2 flight were prepared in coordination with ESA and Keyser Italia. BIOFILMS 2 launched at the end of July 2022. The decision to delay was driven by the potential risk linked with the time window available for BIOFILMS 2 readiness, squeezed to 2 months by SpX-23 and SpX-24 launch dates.  Moreover, ESA was informed by SpaceX that cold stowage capabilities on SpX-24 were overly subscribed, and no room was available for BIOFILMS 2. We had a similar risk for SpX-23 that would have required a re-design of the BIOFILMS packaging to fit the hardware (HW) in only one Double Cold Bag (DCB). The decision was made to launch BIOFILM 2 on SpX-25 in July. The samples were returned in August 2022.\nBIOFILMS 3:\nThe samples were prepared as for BIOFILMS 1 and 2 and launched March 2023 and returned in April 2023.\nPost-flight Analysis\nThe post-flight analysis included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence microscopy of the bacterial cultures and biofilms. The SEM analysis allows detailed insights into biofilm morphology, matrix structure, and overall integrity of the bacteria. Via focused ion beam-SEM (FIB-SEM) cross-sectioning, biofilm thickness and structure in direct relation to the available surface topography can be assessed by high resolution imaging. For the fluorescence microscopic analysis, different fluorescent dyes were used, such as DAPI for straining nucleic acids and biofilm matrix straining dyes such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-marked wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). [Ed. Note: DAPI is a flourescent stain that binds to regions in DNA.]\nMaterial Characterization\nBy comparing the data from the preflight experiments, the topographical and chemical influence of the bacteria (e.g., through corrosive material removal) on the substrate is determined. This allows both the ability to determine the damaging influence of bacterial biofilms on the surface, and local damage providing an indication of the presence and activity of bacteria during the experiment. This provides data to determine any differences in bacterial behavior due to changes in gravity, as well as the weighting of short-scale interactions such as Van der Waals forces on colonization behavior through close comparison with the proteomic analyses. Localized surface disruption, oxide growth, and chemical surface modification are investigated localized via FIB-SEM and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), while phase analysis of the substrate and oxide films is conducted via grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD). Additionally, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used for the analysis of metal ions diffused into the medium. The method allows the determination of metal ions in a wide dynamic concentration range from parts-per-trillion (ppt) to parts-per-million (ppm).\nResults\na.  Patterning at both the 3 micron and 800 nm levels seems to stress all three organisms (Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, Cupriavidus metallidurans, and Acinetobacter radioresistens), as evidenced by the production of more extracellular material (presumably mostly extracellular polysaccharides) on all metal surfaces.\nb. Copper shows clear inhibition of microbial growth. The SEM photomicrographs clearly show damaged/lysed cells.\nc. Brass coupons appear to inhibit microbial growth, but less than copper. More copper ions were detected in the medium from the cells grown on copper coupons than on the brass coupons.       d. The extracellular material produced on the copper and brass plates has a more spotty/blotchy appearance than the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on the stainless steel plates.  This was attributed to the interaction of copper with the EPS. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX) analyses are underway to discern the differences and similarities.\nStatistical analyses are being conducted on the data and will be published within the coming months.",

            "task_description": "Health of the musculoskeletal system depends on exposure to mechanical loading. Removal or reduction of mechanical loading precipitates muscle atrophy and bone loss. Thus, despite rigorous exercise protocols and other countermeasures, muscle atrophy and bone loss are still virtually inevitable consequences of spaceflight. One approach for ameliorating the development of these untoward consequences of space travel is by the induction of artificial gravity during spaceflight via centrifugation. The strength of the artificial gravity depends both on the speed of rotation and diameter of the ship. While it is possible to achieve centrifugal force equivalent 1.0 G, it is also possible that lower levels of force may also be effective for preventing muscle atrophy and irreversible bone loss.  In this study, we propose to evaluate the potential effectiveness of artificial gravity for the prevention of muscle atrophy and weakness and bone loss by studying rats using an innovative system for partial unloading that has been developed previously for mice by members of our team. We will study the musculoskeletal response of adult male rats (n=14 / group) following exposure to different degrees of unloading representing 0.2 G, 0.4 G, and 0.7 G as well as fully loaded animals for 1, 2, and 4 weeks. We will study the impact of this partial gravity analog environment on muscle and bone structure and function, including performing histological analyses, in situ force measurement of muscle contraction, as well as measurement of bone mass, microarchitecture, and strength. In addition, we will perform both serological and tissue molecular analyses to better understand the mechanisms and time course of development of these changes at different degrees of unloading. This work will also allow us to more effectively understand the relationship between the development of muscle atrophy and weakness and bone deterioration at varying levels of artificial gravity.  At the conclusion of this study, we will have defined the potential impact of partial artificial gravity for prevention of musculoskeletal dysfunction and deterioration. This work will inform the future application of artificial gravity in human research and space exploration.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "We believe that this research will positively impact in life on Earth since it will inform us about the effects of reduced muscle and bone use that occur normally in our daily lives and as a consequence of disease or injury. For example, using a cane may reduce the normal weightbearing of a single limb. While this obviously may be necessary from an assistive standpoint, this could lead to additional atrophy of the limb muscles and osteopenia of the bone."

Sloan Foundation, as a result of a Space Act Agreement between NASA and the Sloan Foundation, for Collaborative Research Proposal for Microbiology of the Built Environment (MoBE). The purpose of this Space Act Agreement is to enhance the ability of NASA and the Sloan Foundation to support scientific research and the dissemination of information about the effect of spaceflight on microbial ecosystems in spacecraft such as the International Space Station (ISS) through sponsorship of postdoctoral fellowships. NASA is providing the isolates for all studies.\nUnderstanding the impact of spaceflight on microbial ecosystem dynamics and biofilm formation is critical for spacecraft design, operations, and astronaut health. Biofilms are microbial communities that that adhere to surfaces, causing materials degradation, operational systems failure, and serious infections -- and are resistant to disinfectants/antimicrobials. Biofilms have been reported on spacecraft materials associated with regenerative life support systems, including the International Space Station (ISS) potable water system, which presents a serious threat to onboard systems operation and crew health. The ISS is a built environment that has housed over 200 international crew members and their accompanying microbes since 2000. As such, it is characterized by its own microbiome that has been consistently exposed and adapted to the unique low fluid shear environment of microgravity, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses, and may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation and evolution of these microorganisms. Many ISS microbial isolates are known to be biofilm formers and naturally exist in multispecies ecosystems. While a variety of microbial isolates have been recovered from the ISS potable water over the years, an understanding of how adaptation to spaceflight impacts the formation and function of these organisms as mixed polymicrobial communities in their normal ISS habitat is not known. Likewise, there is extremely limited understanding of how these microbial communities impact spaceflight systems operation and integrity (including regenerative life support systems) and risk to human health.\nA limited number of spaceflight and RWV (rotating wall vessel) studies have shown that single microbial species form biofilms, with evidence suggesting unique biofilm architecture in microgravity. However, biofilms naturally exist as consortia of multiple microbial species, and there is extremely limited knowledge of how multiple bacterial species form polymicrobial communities in ISS liquid environments, or how these microbial communities present in ISS water systems have changed over time under the selective pressures of the microgravity environment. To begin to address this gap, we propose to develop a series of independent ISS potable water microbial community model systems using predominant bacterial isolates obtained in the same year, and compare how adaptation to the ISS environment in each of these water-microbiome systems has impacted their interactions, ability to form biofilms, and resistance to a commonly used chemical disinfectant aboard the ISS. The archived microbial isolates proposed for use have been collected from the ISS potable water system during three specific years over a six-year period. Microbial isolates from the same year will be simultaneously co-cultured as mixed microbial communities in the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor as a spaceflight analogue culture system. The proposed methods to accomplish the research objectives include: real-time video (to monitor polymicrobial growth and biofilm formation in RWVs); use of selective media (to monitor viable population dynamics within the polymicrobial communities and susceptibility to chemical disinfectants); and various staining techniques in combination with microscopy (to investigate biofilm formation/architecture).\nWe hypothesize that polymicrobial interactions within the ISS water microbiome cultured in ground-based spaceflight analogue conditions will present distinct differences in biofilm formation, architecture, population dynamics and resistance to disinfectant.",

Specifically, this study will utilize the spaceflight analogue platform to broaden our knowledge of 1) how microbial populations cause biofouling of potable water systems, and 2) for the development of new strategies to prevent microbial biofouling, maintain function, and ensure public health."

            "task_description": "The goal of the proposed work is to determine the effects of space flight on growth, performance (productivity and time to maturation), metabolism, and genetic changes in radish plants (Raphanus sativus). Plants will be grown in the ADVANCED PLANT HABITAT (APH) hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and in comparable experiments in ground controls. The research conforms to NASA’s top future goal of long-term space exploration and terraforming other planets and satellites. These goals depend on nutritionally valuable food crops that can be reliably grown in an environment that is not only defined by altered gravity or weightless environment but also different atmospheric conditions. In contrast to studying direct effects of gravity on plants, our approach focuses on secondary, derived conditions such as altered convection, transpiration, watering conditions, CO2, other gaseous components, and LED illumination, which creates a characteristic energy (heat and light) gradient within the growth volume.\nRadishes are good candidate plants to grow on the ISS because they mature quickly (harvest after = 28 days after planting), have been grown successfully on the ISS (Massa et al., 2013); genetic and metabolic information is readily available (Shen et al., 2013); and they are nutritionally desirable and provide a wealth of information that can thoroughly be analyzed by biochemical, physiological, and genetic approaches. Radishes are good sources of minerals (especially K, Ca, Fe, and Zn), complex carbohydrates, vitamin C, dietary fibers, folic acid (vitamin B9), anthocyanins, and glucosinolates, a class of secondary metabolites characteristic for Brassicaceae. In addition to their roots, certain varieties of radish are used for their leaves, siliques, and oil. The nutritional value and versatility of these vegetables makes them good candidates as a crop plant for astronauts. The small seed size (<4 mm), longevity of seeds (up to five years), small plant size, and the ability to consume the entire plant makes radishes ideally suited for space biology.\nPrevious studies have focused on the effect of gravity and shown that space conditions allow successful cultivation of Brassica species (Musgrave et al., 2000). However, the quality, biomass, sensitivity of growth to day length, and (constant) temperature are important parameters for this species that have yet to be studied, especially in light of results that seed development in space cultures was compromised (Kuang et al., 2005), especially when oxygen was limited (Kuang et al., 1998). Equally unknown is the effect of environmental conditions in spacecrafts on the performance of plants. Understandably, the emphasis on space biology focuses on the effect of weightlessness and gravity on plant orientation and mechanical properties (Hoson 1999). However, conditions that are the consequence of weightlessness, e.g., lack of convection or altered atmosphere, are equally significant but unknown.\nOur proposal intends to measure the metabolic, physiological, and genetic responses of radishes grown on the ISS and identify the effect of the space environment on metabolite accumulation, flavor, enzyme activity, mineral uptake, and generation time. This knowledge will be essential for the transition from Earth-bound cultivation of plants to growth conditions in space; the research is important for the establishment of human colonies on the Moon, Mars, and farther outposts.\nReferences\nHoson T (1999) Interaction of gravity with other environmental factors in growth and development: An introduction.

            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The objective to grow plants under space conditions requires optimization of auxiliary parameters such as light intensity, quality, watering, substrate definition, fertilization that all have immediate implications for more efficient agricultural practices. The data that we will obtain examine much more than simple yield (mass) of the plants but include the mineral content, propensity to flower, flavor components, and water use. All attempts will not only optimize plant culture under elevated CO2, limited water, and controlled fertilizer provision, but also investigate the genetic responses of plants to mitigate space (or agricultural) stress. The overall result of the project will therefore benefit our generic understanding of factors that control plant growth and productivity in space and on Earth."

            "task_progress": "Progress Report for NASA Grant 80NSSC17K0344  Principal Investigator: Dr. Karl H. Hasenstein   Period covered by the report: 7/2021 – 10/2022   Name and address of the recipient’s institution:   University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette LA 70504   Award number: 80NSSC17K0344   December 5, 2022      Objectives:   \tGerminate seeds and support plant growth for extended cultivation.   \tControl growth and provide adequate water and fertilization.   \tAssessment of variances of plant growth in space and in ground controls.   \tCrew handling aspects of the NASA Advanced Plant Habitat/APH (planting, sampling & harvesting).\nThe space experiment (APH2):  The objective of the space flight experiment was to assess crop plant performance in space and analyze the effect of weightlessness, elevated CO2, specific light conditions, and artificial substrate on plant growth, productivity, and changes in gene expression, which was assessed by RNA-sequencing of the space experiments, NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ground control with elevated CO2, and lab control with ambient CO2.\nThe preparations for the flight experiments were completed and the prepared (seeded) science carrier launched on the Cygnus 14 flight on 10/2/20. The first experiment was initiated on November 3 and completed by 11/30 2020. The second grow-out started 12/1 and was completed 12/30/2020. Sample return occurred in two batches. The first half of material was returned May 2nd and received at the University of Louisiana (UL) on June 2nd. The second half of the material was returned on SpaceX 22 on July 9, 2021. The previous report described space and control growth results; this report focuses on the content analyses and RNA-seq data.\nPlant productivity:   The leaf area per quadrant for the first ISS experiment compared well with previous grow-outs (EVT and ? EVT). The weight determinations for the radish bulbs showed an increasing trend but no statistically different values for the space and ground controls. The ambient conditions at the PI lab (gas-chromatography / GC-UL) showed the largest leaf area. The bulb mass showed a similar trend as the leaf area but was not significantly different between any of the samples.\nThe relationship between elevated CO2 indicated a stronger correlation between leaf area and bulb mass than for the ambient CO2 concentration. Elevated CO2 may lead to greater leaf area but not higher bulb mass.\nAlthough without apparent effect on plant productivity, a comparison between the water consumption in space and KSC ground control illustrated the effect of weightlessness on the water distribution in the growth substrate. The difference between the top and bottom moisture sensors was apparent for the ground control but not for space data. The early growth period was characterized by low water consumption. As expected, the water demand increased with leaf growth. Larger fluctuations during the last week indicate strain for the water delivery system.\nNutritional values:  A major element of the proposed work was an assessment of the nutritional value of space grown plant material. We examined the amount of protein and minerals in leaves and bulbs of radishes under space and ground conditions. Similar to the leaf area and bulb mass data, there were no significant differences between space and ground-grown plants or elevated and ambient CO2 concentration. As had been shown previously, the leaf material had higher protein and mineral content compared with the bulbs. Protein was determined as nitrogen using a conversion factor of 6.25 between N and protein. The mineral content showed higher values for leaves than bulbs and the spectrum of minerals between ground controls and space experiments were not significant.\nAssessment of photosynthetic efficiency:  Instead of using a hand-held fluorimeter to collect spot samples, an indirect measurement was implemented that evaluated the photosynthetic activity by calculating the Normalized Differential Vegetative Index (NDVI), which relies on the difference between leaf reflectivity at 750 nm and 650 nm.   NDVI = (R750 - R650)/(R750 + R650).\nThe measurements were possible without touching, and therefore resulted in no damage to the leaves. Since the available infrared (IR) camera only allows images from the rear of the APH, no information from plants in the front of the APH could be obtained. The NDVI data showed a decrease in photosynthetic performance for all conditions and may at least partially be related to the increased sampling of older leaves as the plants matured. Although NDVI assessment does not provide the same information as a specific fluorescence-based system, reduced crew time and the non-invasive nature of reflective measurements justified a lower precision data acquisition. Healthy NDVI assessments of photosynthesis results in values = 80 %; it is possible that the steady decline was linked with the appearance of necrotic tissue along the rim of most leaves.\nqPCR analyses of leaf punch samples:  The experimental protocol included sampling of leaf tissue at day 10, 18, and 24 of the 27 day grow-out. These samples were intended to assess the temporal variation of relevant genes in leaf tissue. The samples were collected by astronauts and stored in microfuge tubes at -80°C until processing. The storage time for the ground control and space samples were similar (about six months), but differed between samples from the first and second grow-out on the ISS. The quantified genes included Napin Storage Protein (RSN), Peroxidase Precursor (RPP), Glucosinolate Synthase (GIS), Chlorophyll Binding Protein (CBP), and Raphanus myrosinase (RMA). The expression level of these genes was evaluated against the reference genes Actin-7 and Ubiquitin-1. Although the general profile of these genes is similar, the ground control had the highest myrosinase levels. The transcription was reduced during initial bulb formation (day 18) but recovers by day 24, three days before harvest. In contrast, samples from ISS1 show a steady decline in myrosinase. These data confirm that gene expression does change during the growth period and that leaf punch data can serve the intended purpose, namely evaluating plant health, culture conformity, and comparisons between different growth conditions.\nComparison between tissue extraction and Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE):  The second ISS grow-out included a test for a simplified genetic sampling method and comparing it with the ground control. SPGE is based on oligo-dT-functionalized probes that upon insertion into tissue extract mRNA based on the hybridization between the oligo-dA tail that is characteristic for mRNA and the oligo-dT layer of the SPGE probe. Although the extraction material is best processed immediately after extraction, preliminary tests showed that the mRNA remains intact for 16 weeks, less than the required storage at -80°C. Despite these uncertainties, SPGE extraction resembled the quantification from leaf punch samples from ISS2 grow-out and ground control. This observation validates SPGE as efficient, fast, and reliable extraction method.\nRNA-seq evaluation:  The overall assessment of differences between space conditions and CO2 effects required three comparisons, a space experiment at predetermined (2500 ppm CO2), a ground control at the same CO2 concentration, and a ground control at ambient (~400 ppm CO2). RNA-seq also allowed for a comparison between the first and second grow-out on the ISS. Sequencing relied on space material (bulb and leaves, 4 replicates each); KSC (= ground control, bulbs, and leaves, 3 replicates each); and UL control (bulbs and leaves, 3 reps each).\n28 samples were extracted and sequenced (Novogene, 8801 Folsom Blvd, Sacramento, CA 9582) on an Illumina system resulting in paired end reads of 150 bp.\nReference genome and gene model annotation files were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website:(\nhttps://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/plant/Raphanus_sativus/all_assembly_versions/GCF_000801105.1_Rs1.0/\n)  Alignment to the reference genome was done using Hisat2 v2.0.5. The mapped reads of each sample were assembled by StringTie (v1.3.3b) and full-length transcripts with multiple splice variants quantified for each gene locus with featureCounts (v.1.5.0). Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced (FPKM) of each gene was calculated for each gene.\nThe DESeq2 R-package (1.20.0) was used for determining differential expression. The resulting P-values were adjusted with Benjamini and Hochberg's method. Genes with an adjusted P-value of <=0.05 were assumed to be differentially expressed. Adjusted p-values multiplied by ln(2) transformed expression values were used to obtain a combined, linearized parameter that estimates significant changes between treatments. A correlation analysis verified sample reliability and repeatability of the experiment.   A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the FPKM values of all samples and showed strong segregation of leaf and bulb data. Separation between treatments clustered leaves into three distinct groups, Space, Ground control with elevated, and ambient CO2.\nThe Correlation and PCA analyses were further corroborated by the examining the overall gene counts that are differentially expressed under different experimental conditions.\nDifferentially expressed gene counts show reduced diversity between the first and second ISS grow-outs and greater variability between leaf material, and under different CO2 conditions Up regulation occurred as often as down regulation.\nDifferentially expressed transcripts of down- and up-regulated genes were considered for pathway analyses if they resulted in more than two-fold difference and a p-value of <0.05. Data of higher stringency (more than five-fold down or up-regulated and p <0.001) were used to identify affected enzymes.\nThe number of altered genes under similar conditions (i.e., first and second ISS grow-out) can further provide a base value of gene variability without space or stress-related responses. This variability is higher in leaves than in bulbs, and by the time of harvest ranges from about 34 genes for bulbs and 158 genes for leaves. Further work will try to identify an associated error range for these estimates.\nThe larger contribution of CO2 effects as primary factor indicates that atmospheric conditions, including airflow, play an important role for plant growth experiments. Future experiments should study different gas concentrations to develop a comprehensive data set on plant susceptibility to pressure, temperature, and partial pressure of included gases.\nd13C analysis:  An attempt was made to measure the isotope fractionation in space-grown plants. d13C‰= [(13C/12C sample)/(13C/12C Std)-1]x1000. We determined the d13C value for ISS (1&2) and ground control samples. The data showed large differences between all conditions and the values deviated from the standard value for C3 plants (-30‰)The shift (likely based on the type of CO2 compression) made the attempted analysis unreliable as the 13C value of the utilized CO2 was not known.\nSummary:  The space experiment APH2 was successfully completed, and most of the analytical work accomplished. The main conclusions are that radishes can grow well in space, have similar productivity as on Earth, and respond to elevated CO2 more than to weightlessness. RNA-seq analyses identify photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism as major affected pathways. The rich data sets will be published, and the sequencing data be deposited into NASA’s GeneLab database.",

            "task_description": "The detrimental effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system are well known.  It is believed that these effects may lead to clinically significant risks to astronauts on long duration space missions as well as to the success of these missions themselves.  Current studies are limited primarily to human studies and rodent experiments.  However, these model systems and human studies have significant limitations that may be addressed by using the well-established Drosophila model.  Drosophila have previously been successfully launched into space and a ground-based Drosophila model for cardiac disease and function has been developed. However, the genetically versatile Drosophila model has yet to be used for studying the effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system.\nWe flew 4 genotypes of Drosophila aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for approximately 30 days, along with identical 1-g ground controls.  The Drosophila required minimal astronaut intervention, primarily transfer to an incubator and stowage within the ISS.  The samples will be retrieved post-flight and analyzed using established methods.  Heart function, including measurements of diastolic and systolic intervals, heart rate, heart diameters, contractility, and arrhythmias was recorded.  Microscopic and immuno-histochemical evaluations of heart morphology was carried out.  Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by RNA Sequencing (RNA Seq) was conducted on both heart and brain tissue.\nThe ultimate goal of this research was to obtain data on heart muscle function in low gravity while validating the Drosophila model for studying the effects of spaceflight on cardiac disease and function. Our studies identified disruption in metabolic gene expression and a dramatic increase in proteasome gene expression. This was confirmed in a subsequent flight with immuno-histochemical analyses. The increased proteasome numbers correlated with an increase in amyloid-like protein aggregations within the heart tissue and with increased myofibrillar disarray. We also documented a decrease in collagen fibers associated with the sarcomere Z-lines within myocardial cells.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Information about cardiac muscle function in microgravity is expected to provide insights on genetic and molecular changes that occur with muscle atrophy on Earth. For example, we identified an increase in misfolded muscle protein associated with aggregated proteasomes in the heart muscle cells.

            "task_progress": "Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low-Earth orbit, the Moon, and beyond. Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit reduced climbing ability, cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling, and diminished cardiac output. Analysis of gene expression in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric / extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and increased expression of genes encoding proteasome subunits (cellular garbage disposals).        We further examined the role of proteasomes and protein misfolding on a second flight. We sent flies expressing fluorescently labeled proteins that we could monitor when returned to Earth for misfolding (as protein plaques). We were also able to use staining techniques to monitor proteasome numbers. We observed dramatic increases in protein plaque number and size in flies exposed to micro g and these were co-localized with large proteasome aggregates. Remarkably, in long-QT causing seizure (sei) / human ether-a-go-go (hERG) mutants, proteasomal gene expression was already lower than wildtype at 1g , but under micro g we still observed an increase compared to the 1g ground controls. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.       Our experiments validated the use of Vented Fly Boxes (VFBs) for fly experiments that require minimal space and astronaut input yet provide significant insights into organismal function under low gravity. One unexpected outcome from our second flight was excessive fungal contamination of samples stored in the Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) incubator. This information should assist future experiments that use this equipment to ensure that the experiments are not compromised by external contaminants. Nevertheless, the inclusion of fly boxes that were maintained as backup for the original flight permitted us to complete our analyses. The complete gene expression dataset is available on NASA's GeneLab database. Although not part of our original proposal we also developed an assay to measure both gene and protein expression from the same tissue source (brain) from the flies. Our analyses suggest that there are fundamental changes in proteins in metabolic pathways, circadian rhythm signaling, and the visual system that occur in micro g.  This dataset is also available on GeneLab.",

            "task_description": "Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the \"spaceflight syndrome\") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.\nCentral Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.\nSpecific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:\nA. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.\nB. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or \"RNA-Seq\") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance.\nThis report documents the activities related to “Global transcriptome profiling to identify cellular stress mechanisms responsible for spaceflight-induced antibiotic resistance”. The original grant was to perform the spaceflight experiment “Biological Research in Canisters #21 (BRIC-21), with the aim of understanding how bacterial cells perceive and respond to the human spaceflight environment. We have successfully completed all the original aims and goals of this grant proposal.\nNew Objective:  \tIn 2019, this grant was tasked with a new objective: to develop and test in spaceflight a new sample compartment for use in BRIC-PDFU and/or BRIC-LED hardware. In all previous BRIC experiments, the sample compartment consisted of the bottom half of a standard 60-mm Petri dish. However, during the BRIC-21 experiment we noted that liquid cultures assumed a toroidal shape in spaceflight (FL), in contrast to the disk-shaped ground control (GC) samples. It was hypothesized that this difference in culture geometry might account in part for the measured differences in the transcriptomic responses between FL and GC samples (Morrison, M.D., P. Fajardo-Cavazos, and W.L. Nicholson. 2019. Comparison of Bacillus subtilis transcriptome profiles from two separate missions to the International Space Station. npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0).  \tIn collaboration with the laboratories of Drs. Mark Weislogel and Titel Jurca, we have conceived and built a new sample compartment designed to mitigate the effects of microgravity on liquid culture geometry in petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Drop-tower and biocompatibility testing of a prototype device was in progress when our labs were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which essentially halted all progress on the project for several months. During the past year (10/01/2020 to 09/30/2021), we have resumed laboratory operations and have completed testing of the new modified Petri dish insert. It is now ready for utilization in spaceflight.",

            "task_progress": "The major factor influencing the behavior of microbes growing in liquids in space is microgravity. We recently measured the transcriptomic response of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis to the microgravity environment inside the ISS in spaceflight hardware called Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs). In two separate experiments in the ISS, dubbed BRIC-21 and BRIC-23, we grew multiple replicates of the same B. subtilis strain in the same hardware, growth medium, and temperature with matching ground control samples (npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0). [Ed. Note: See Cumulative Bibliography listing.] In both experiments, we observed similar responses of the transcriptome to spaceflight. However, we also noted that the liquid cultures assumed a different configuration in microgravity (a toroidal shape) compared with the ground control samples (a flat disk shape), leading us to question whether the transcriptome differences we observed were a direct result of microgravity, or a secondary result of the different liquid geometries of the samples affecting, for example, oxygen availability.\nTo mitigate the influence of microgravity on liquid geometry in BRIC canisters, we have designed an insert to replace the standard 60-mm Petri dish in BRIC-PDFU or BRIC-LED sample compartments. In this design, liquid cultures are expected to assume a more disk-like configuration regardless of gravity or its absence. We have: (i) constructed a prototype device by 3D printing; (ii) evaluated different starting materials, treatments, and coatings for their wettability (i.e., hydrophilicity) using contact angle measurements; (iii) confirmed that the device performs as designed by drop-tower testing and; (iv) performed material biocompatibility studies using liquid cultures of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Future microgravity testing of the device in the ISS is planned.",

            "task_description": "Bacteria and other microorganisms have been shown to grow as surface-adherent biofilm communities in the microgravity environment during spaceflight. Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. As a result of supplemental funding, we are now able to gather genetic data on the mechanisms by which mixed bacterial species are able to form biofilms in microgravity conditions. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth.",

The third sample returned with Crew-1 on May 2, 2021. We encountered two major issues that have led us to request a reflight (which has been approved). One issue was media contamination, rendering our data interpretation as inconclusive. A second issue (needlestick injury to a space crewmember) resulted in some of our samples incubating for 117 days on the International Space Station (ISS) rather than the planned 4 days. While that caused a potential loss of some transcriptome data (described in the Task Progress section), a really positive development from the extended incubation resulted in enhanced microbial corrosion data, as well as the return of viable microorganisms that can now be investigated for genetic changes as a consequence of prolonged spaceflight. We are now pursuing an active study of experimental evolution in collaboration with the microbiology lab at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) (Co-I Mark Ott, Sarah Wallace, and their team). Another major positive development is the initiative to develop a machine learning computational approach to identify microbial-induced corrosion (MIC). MIC represents an estimated annual global economic loss of $500B and detection is a key need. We anticipate that our analytical approach in this area will have major economic benefits, far beyond the space program. Once our reflight occurs, we will be able to complete all of our original objectives easily within a year of getting our samples."

            "task_progress": "Our overall objectives for this proposal are to study surface-adherent bacterial growth (biofilm formation) on stainless steel materials used for the water recovery system on the International Space Station, with a mixed bacterial population and its potential contributions to stainless steel corrosion during spaceflight, and compare these effects to those seen on Earth-based studies (ground controls). Included in these studies were tests to investigate the role of a potential silver-based disinfectant in controlling biofilm formation and associated corrosion. At the outset, we proposed to study biofilms using light and electron microscopy during spaceflight as well as with identical experiments on Earth (ground controls). We have since expanded these techniques, and more importantly, the rigor of the microscopy investigations by developing a computer analysis approach for quantitative analysis of the light microscopy results.\nDuring the current year (2022-2023), we began the process of developing an artificial intelligence-based approach to measure microbial corrosion using electron microscopy. We also obtained approval from NASA to include analysis of genetic activity (officially termed transcriptome analysis) so that we would be able to determine the activities of the microorganisms during spaceflight and ground experiments in the presence and absence of silver disinfectants. Our initial flight experiment launched on SpaceX CRS-21 in December 2020, and most of our samples were returned in mid-January 2021. A later set of samples, containing living bacteria, returned in May 2021. Just prior to the December 2020 launch, we learned that one of the commercially-supplied ingredients of our bacterial growth media was contaminated, so while we obtained results from the initial experiments, we were unable to determine whether any effects were due to the spaceflight conditions or due to the contamination. As a result, we have been approved for a reflight, which is currently scheduled for March 2024. The goal of the reflight will be to conduct and analyze our original experiments related to biofilm growth, potential control by silver disinfection, and its role in microbial corrosion of stainless steel. One unexpected positive opportunity arose from our delayed sample (returned in May 2021) as we were able to culture living bacteria, that had been incubated in orbit for 117 days. We also have ground control bacteria that incubated for the same duration, and with the assistance of the microbiology team at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), we are able to sequence these organisms, as well as the original “ancestral bacteria” (cultures preserved prior to experimentation) and see whether spaceflight induces any unique mutations in these organisms, a scientific approach referred to as experimental evolution. These two studies (experimental evolution and developing artificial intelligence to diagnose microbial corrosion) have been our most active areas of research during the 2022-23 period.\nIn summary, while the original contamination event and reflight scheduling has been quite challenging, we have obtained some unexpected bonus science in computer-aided image analysis of biofilms and corrosion, as well as an unexpected and highly meaningful opportunity to investigate whether spaceflight affects bacterial evolution. With a future successful reflight, we anticipate a highly successful scientific outcome.",

The research in this GeneLab Data System study sought to extend the bioinformatics tool development for GeneLab data to a cross-kingdom architecture, making inter-organismal comparisons possible. This approach facilitates mining across the wealth of datasets within the GeneLab system and drives insights into the fundamental responses to spaceflight shared by biological systems as a whole. This work has approached some of GeneLab's core questions as to how implementation of large-scale dataset analyses can help produce new insights and hypotheses about the effects of spaceflight on biology. .\nAn interactive data visualization and mining environment has been developed based on the Qlik engine, which covers all the biology data deposited within GeneLab. This approach allows users to make interactive comparisons and filters between datasets to mine for both common and unique features of the transcriptomes of the GeneLab data.  Current work is focused on maintaining and expanding this data environment and moving towards a highly intuitive user interface. This tool will allow users to rapidly move from data exploration to identifying spaceflight-response genes and from there to testable hypotheses.\nSpecific aims:\n(1) Import the diversity of the datasets from the GeneLab Data repository into the Qlik database and develop Orthologous Matrix- and Gene Ontology-driven approaches to translate between them in a kingdom-transparent manner.\n(2) Explore using common phenotyping tools and approaches for the research community to facilitate the testing of potential roles of these genes in spaceflight-related factors. This effort will focus on elements of spaceflight such as microgravity and hypoxic stress response that are applicable to a wide range of organisms.",

Completion of the TOAST database: The Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database is a web-based data visualization and analysis environment for all publicly available plant science spaceflight data. The system imports data from GeneLab, from the original publications on each study and from datasets made available by the primary researchers. These data have then been manually curated and linked in a relational database that allows researchers to rapidly compare transcriptome patterns across studies of interest. This tool has been through extensive beta testing and optimization and the fully functional version is publicly available at:\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast.\nThe paper describing the TOAST data visualization environment was published in 2020 in Frontiers in Plant Science.\nII. Ortholog mapping using the Cross-Species Explorer: A major goal for this research program has been to extend the data visualizations outlined above for TOAST to all the data available in the GeneLab data repository, including animal, plant, and microbial datasets. To this end, equivalent genes (orthologs) have been mapped across species. All the datasets deposited in GeneLab have then been imported and visualization and cross-referencing tools developed to make these comparisons transparent to the user. The web app to access this data engine (called the X-species Explorer) is publicly available at:\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/x-species-astrobiology-genelab.\nIII. The Rad-Bio-App: In a parallel effort to help space biologists explore the effects of radiation across the available spaceflight omics-level data, a data visualization environment called the Rad-Bio-App has been developed. All the available radiation dosage data from the spaceflight experimentation deposited in GeneLab, as well as that from ground-based studies that have used a variety of sources and accelerators, have been imported and curated alongside associated metadata ranging from the source and type of radiation to species analyzed and hardware used to perform the experiment. All these data are then linked in a database to the associated Gene Lab data accessions, along with available data from the lunar and Martian environments. The App then allows users to explore the GeneLab datasets for their associated radiation environments and filter for similar and different experiment parameters. RadBioApp has 2 goals: (1) providing a useful tool for space radiation biologists, and (2) making analysis of radiation effects more accessible to the non-specialist researcher. The tool is available at:\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astro-rad-bio-app.\nIV. Metadata analyses -The Matrix: GeneLab has developed standardized pipelines for analysis of microarray and RNAseq to help make data comparisons between studies more robust. In collaboration with the GeneLab Plant Analysis Working Group (Plant AWG), a curated metadata matrix (The Matrix) that cross-references to these GeneLab analyses has been developed. The combination of The Matrix and the standardized analyses allows researchers to ask what variables affect the spaceflight data most significantly. This tool is available at:\nhttps://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/matrix-of-genelab-metadata.\nV. Presentations, Outreach, and Education: During the course of this funding, the data visualizations made possible by this research have allowed presentations to be made at the annual meetings of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, the Space Generation Advisory Council in Taiwan, The International Space Station Research and Development (ISS R&D) Conference, the annual meeting of the American Society of Plant Biologists, the Midwest Plant Cell Dynamics Meeting, NASA Kennedy Space Center, the Academia Sinica in Taiwan, and at Carthage College. This space research has also formed the basis for outreach efforts at events ranging from University of Wisconsin sponsored outreach days (e.g., University of Wisconsin’s Science Expeditions), to work with groups such as the University of Wisconsin’s PEOPLE program (that engages under-represented groups in science), to Madison’s BioHouse (that engages with high-achieving undergraduates), to middle school and K-12 teachers (the BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute training program), to the Kids in Data program designed to introduce young students to concepts of data analysis, to space camp for 5th grades at the Deke Slayton Bike and Space Museum in Sparta, WI.\n15 independent study students have worked in the Gilroy lab most semesters on various plant molecular and engineering projects related to space biology, with a team of ~4 contributing to user interface design for the GeneLab X-Species Explorer.

            "task_description": "Opportunistic pathogens such as latent viruses pose a unique hazard to crew members because of the ineffectiveness of preflight quarantine periods and decreased immune function. Latent herpesviruses reactivate and shed in higher quantities during and after long and short spaceflights. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important herpesvirus from a public health viewpoint that causes severe systemic infections upon primary infection or on reactivation from latency. The few antiviral drugs available to treat CMV infection suffer from safety, efficacy, and resistance issues, and no vaccine against CMV is currently available. As NASA and collaborating space agencies plan for future exploration class missions (i.e., to Mars or an asteroid), eliminating the risk of an adverse health event due to alterations in virus latency, reactivation, and lytic replication is paramount. Evidence of impaired control of latent viral infections has been documented during short (i.e., 14-day Space Shuttle missions) as well as long (i.e., 6-month International Space Station missions) duration spaceflight missions, with the magnitude of this response being positively associated with time in flight. Shedding of herpesviruses including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and CMV was detected in >30% of astronauts in a recent study (Mehta et al., 2017) looking at long-duration spaceflight (60–180 days). These viruses reactivated independently of each other and reactivation frequency increased in duration, and amplitude (viral copy numbers) when compared to short duration (10 to 16 days) space shuttle missions. Thus, it is easy to speculate that the substantially longer durations being proposed for exploration class missions (i.e., up to 3 years) will further increase the risk of an adverse health event due to increased virus reactivation and/or replication. Add increased radiation exposure (both duration and magnitude), limited clinical care, and the impossibility of rapidly returning a casualty back to Earth to the list of potential hazards and it is clear to see why obtaining a better understanding of virus replication under space-like conditions is critical to successfully and safely send humans to, and return them from, these remote extraterrestrial destinations. In this proposal, we aim to determine the impact of space radiation on CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. While most studies on this topic in the past have focused on changes in the human immune system that could induce virus reactivation, we will approach this topic from both virus and host standpoints. We will study differences in CMV latency and reactivation before and after radiation exposure and determine if these changes can be correlated with specific changes in virus genome and/or transcriptome. Also, because virus control, dissemination, and resolution are ultimately governed by the competency, or lack thereof, of the host immune system, we will determine the impact of pre-exposing NK-cells and T-cells to space radiation on their ability to control active CMV infections. In this project, we will focus on a single variable: space radiation, rather than looking at multiple variables such as microgravity, physical and psychological stresses of space travel, diet, medications, or other factors associated with spaceflight. The overarching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce specific changes in CMV genome/transcriptome or immune control of infection that will induce CMV reactivation and/or increase in virus replication and pathogenicity. The specific aims to test this hypothesis are:\nSpecific Aim 1: Determine the impact of space radiation on CMV genome and transcriptome.\nSpecific Aim 2: Correlate radiation induced changes in CMV genome and/or transcriptome with CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication.\nSpecific Aim 3: Determine the impact of space radiation on immune cell control in a mouse model of CMV infection.\nReference: Mehta SK, Laudenslager ML, Stowe RP, Crucian BE, Feiveson AH, Sams CF, Pierson DL.

            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Upon completion of this project, we will gain a better understanding of how radiation impacts CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. By measuring gene expression on infected cells exposed to radiation, using both traditional and cutting-edge techniques, we will be able to identify CMV genomic and transcriptomic changes that affect virus behavior. We will also determine if space radiation can impair NK-cell and T-cell function, allowing for CMV to replicate and disseminate in the host. This will allow us to determine the risk of CMV infection during spaceflight missions and gain a better understanding of the potential underpinning mechanisms. Findings from this study could lead to the development of appropriate countermeasures to ameliorate potential clinical risks associated with CMV reactivation in flight. Moreover, the methods incorporated here can be adapted to examine the effects of radiation on other relevant viral pathogens known to cause significant disease in immunocompromised people that may also pose a risk to crewmembers during spaceflight missions. Discovering the mechanisms of virus reactivation will help with the development of treatment modalities for patients on Earth."

For subsequent reporting, please see \"Effect of Space Radiation on Cytomegalovirus Reactivation and Lytic Replication (P.I.-- Shay)\". (Ed. 10/15/23)\n###\nKasumi cells are hematopoetic stem cell derived monocyte progenitor cells that were infected with a low dose of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and establishment of latency was monitored by analyzing viral gene expression as well as genome copy numbers. Kasumi cells offer an established model of CMV latency and are amenable to latency establishment as well as reactivation in the laboratory. They do not allow lytic viral replication unless differentiated. Once CMV latency was established in these cells, the cells were exposed to gamma, proton, and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) radiation (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0Gy) for different time points (e g., 0 to 30 days) at the Brookvaven National Laboratory (BNL) in New York. The cells were harvested at different times after the irradiation and analyzed for viral load by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It was interesting to note that there was an increase in the viral load for almost all the radiation concentrations used six days after the exposure of gamma, proton, and GCR. The data is being analyzed for statistical significance and interpretation.\nTo date, we have performed 3 out of our proposed 5 ion experiments (during the Spring and Summer 2021 sessions) to determine the impact of space radiation on CMV genome, transcriptome, and reactivation potential. Data from those experiments have been generated and are being analyzed. The addition of the Spring/Summer 2023 experiments will close this aspect of the study and allow for continuation into the next in vivo experimental phase of the project.\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) and team’s accelerator experience: Dr. Satish Mehta has been to BNL on numerous previous occasions and assisted in the ion radiation exposure of our latently infected Epstein-Barr Virus cell lines. Dr. Douglass Diak has never been onsite at BNL but organized the Spring and Summer 2021 shipping/receiving of the latently infected CMV cell lines to/from BNL. In the process, he completed all necessary safety training for onsite BNL work as well.\nWe conducted a similar study at NSRL and the current beam times requested match our historical times, but more importantly have been established using the NSRL beam time calculator. The exposure times are in direct relation to the energy dose requirements (10, 50, 100, and 200cGy), which again match our past radiation studies. Our radiation expert here at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) has recommended these energy doses as well as these radiation sources: gamma, proton, C-12, and Fe-56-. His suggestions are based on the probability of exposure to these sources during actual spaceflight, making our radiation source selection highly relevant to our space study correlations. Though we understand that cosmic radiation is a combination of these individual sources, we believe our understanding of CMV reactivation in response to each of these sources, independently, is crucial.\nAgain, these sources and doses were recommended to us by our resident radiation expert. Additionally, we conducted a similar study and found that these sources and doses were highly effective in stimulating Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) to reactivate.

Total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi cells from the above experiment and was sent for DNA as well as RNA sequencing at Microbial genome sequence center (MiGS) in Pittsburgh, PA. Selected samples were sequenced from the above experiment.\nGenomic analysis: Initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal any genomic variants. The analysis is still ongoing.\nTranscriptomic analysis: Differentially expressed genes comparing the GCR-Day6 cells to pre-exposed cells were analyzed. Interestingly, only UL49 shows a significantly elevated level in GCR-Day6 cells compared to mock. UL49 mutants are currently being made in the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome in order to study its role in latency reactivation.",

However, due to time and cost constraints of conducting studies on the International Space Station (ISS), scientists are not able to perform as many insightful space biology studies as they would like. For this reason, scientists use microgravity simulators to conduct space biology studies, but on Earth. However, there are very limited studies testing how these simulators compare to the \"real\" thing and the jury is still out on whether microgravity simulators are actually comparable to experiments performed on the ISS. For this reason, we wish to carry out a study that looks at how three simulated microgravity chambers, commonly used on the ground, compare to what would be observed on the ISS. This study would have a ground and a flight component and would look at two bacterial properties that are significant for short and long duration space missions--biofilm formation and the exchange of genetic material between bacteria.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "One of NASA’s goals is to minimize the health risks associated with extended spaceflight, so it is critical that methods for preventing and treating spaceflight-induced illnesses be developed before astronauts embark upon long-duration space missions. In order for this to happen, it is important to learn how bacteria that play a role in human health and disease are affected by spaceflight, such as biofilm formation and horizontal gene transfer. Comparing these responses to popular and frequently used simulated microgravity devices on Earth, and verifying whether the same outcomes can be achieved, will allow more researchers to partake in space related microbiology and human microbiome work, without the extensive limitations imposed by conducting experiments on the ISS. This ultimately diversifies the field and opens up opportunities for scientists from all backgrounds.  In addition, understanding microbial adaptation in the new and unique environment of space may help guide future research questions and studies into microbial adaptations on Earth under changing conditions, such as climate change."

            "task_description": "A. Project Description - Long-duration exploration in space has emphasized the importance of understanding how to grow plants under microgravity, so as to supply crews with a continuous source of fresh food as well as provide psychological benefits. Plant and animal microbiomes have been known to play a significant role in maintaining host health and development through the regulation of metabolic and immune responses. Therefore, understanding the microbial population associated with plant growth and suppressing multi-host pathogenesis in spaceflight is not only crucial for sustaining the production of edible crops in space but also vital for the safety of crew members. The objective of this ground-based investigation is to develop a refined understanding of the basal plant microbiome of salad crops grown in plant growth chambers under previously used International Space Station (ISS) growth conditions and assess its potential for plant growth enhancements and human pathogenicity. Defining the basal plant microbiome will enable us to understand how spaceflight causes alterations in plant-microbial interactions and how to utilize it for future space exploration efforts. Hence, the overall goal of this project is to determine the influence of microorganisms associated with salad crops in plant growth and protection against pathogenesis under conditions similar to the ISS by utilizing metagenomics and metatranscriptomic approaches. Our central hypothesis is that changes in gene expression within the microbial population are key to understanding whether the plant microbiome can promote the growth of these crops through growth enhancement pathways. To investigate this hypothesis the following objectives were proposed:\nObjective 1 – to define the metatranscriptome of three different crops grown in plant growth chambers under ISS conditions.\nObjective 2 – to develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways and signaling leading to plant growth enhancements and/or to plant/human pathogenesis identified from the metatranscriptomic data.\nObjective 3 – to develop methods for enhancing plant growth or suppressing the pathogenic activity without eradicating commensal or saprophytic microbes.\nB. Significance - The rationale behind this proposal is to advance the technical readiness necessary to support a sustainable source of fresh food production for extraterrestrial exploration, and this will be accomplished by establishing a strong foundation in understanding how plant-microbe interactions impact the safe and successful production of plants. At the completion of these studies, it is expected that information gathered on the basal microbiome of salad crops cultivated in growth chambers similar to environmental conditions on the ISS will identify those microbes that have the potential to result in multi-host pathogenesis. The proposed metatranscriptomic studies, together with the metagenomic studies conducted by the space food production team at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), will help elucidate the functional pathways and mechanisms by which microbes interact with their host under ISS growth conditions. These data will then allow us to make crucial and informed engineering choices on plant growth hardware systems and crop selection for future space exploration vehicles and habitats. Furthermore, this study will provide new insights into standard terrestrial plant biology as little is currently known about the microbiome of salad crops.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "There exists a limited amount of knowledge about how the vast majority of plant-associated microorganisms impacts the plant’s growth, health, and susceptibility to diseases. To date, the interplay between plants and microorganisms has been largely studied for various leaf pathogens, symbiotic rhizobia, and mycorrhizal fungi. However, little is known about the microbiome of salad crops. Salad crops require minimal processing before consumption and are used to investigate the baseline microbial data for developing space-related produce sanitation methods for safe consumption by the crew. So far, microbial studies performed on salad vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, and cilantro, are mostly culture-dependent methods to determine whether human pathogens survive and persist on the edible surface of the leaves. A survey of the salad microbiome and how it plays a role in maintaining the host’s health and development is lacking. Investigations conducted in spaceflight have revealed that microgravity does alter the plant-microbe interaction at both the genetic and physiological level, with a tendency to increase the susceptibility to plant pathogenesis. It is therefore necessary that a cultivation-independent analysis of the microbial communities found on salad crops be investigated with multi-omics, predominantly metagenomics and metatranscriptomics."

            "task_progress": "Task Progress for Years 1-3:\nIn total, we have two published manuscripts that stem from this postdoctoral fellowship, three oral presentations for the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) (2020-2021), one poster presentation at ASGSR (2019), and another manuscript in preparation. [Ed. Note: for publications, see Cumulative Bibliography. For presentations, see list at end of Task Progress section.]\nResearch Progress for each Objective:\nObjective 1 – to define the metatranscriptome of three different crops grown in plant growth chambers under ISS conditions.\nMajor Outcomes: The major outcomes of this objective were: 1) The 28-day old lettuce metatranscriptome was established and published using the MinION sequencing platform. 2) Illumina NOVAseq sequencing of all lettuce samples at 4 different stages of development was completed and data analysis is nearly completed. 3) High-quality RNA has been extracted from Mizuna samples and optimization for library sequencing has been completed.\nDetails of work progress:   In YR1 of the project, the \"veggie team\" at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) completed the growth of all three crops (lettuce, tomato, and mizuna). However, the tomato samples were harvested by the KSC veggie team in a different manner (liquid nitrogen) compared to the lettuce and mizuna samples (RNALater). Hence, the tomato samples were not used for further investigation in this proposal.\nIn YR1-2: To ensure high-quality metatranscriptomic analysis, a pilot sample of lettuce was used to optimize a protocol for RNA extraction, sample processing, sequencing, bioinformatics pipeline, and metatranscriptomic analysis. Here, a sequencing experiment was done on a portion of the Day 28 lettuce leaf samples. In this experiment, the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer (MinION) was used to analyze the lettuce leaf microbiome. MinION sequencing is the targeted sequencing platform NASA plans to use for future spaceflight sequencing-related experiments. Thus, using the MinION device to sequence the 28-day lettuce leaf microbiome not only enabled us to optimize a protocol for using the MinION to perform quality control surveillance on future space food production; it also enabled us to optimize a bioinformatic pipeline for metatranscriptomic analyses. In addition, further validation can be done when comparing the gold standard Ilumina NOVAseq sequencing method with the new MinION sequencing technology.\nIn YR3 of the project, a thorough analysis of the pilot 28-day old lettuce leaf metatranscriptome (performed on the MinION sequencing platform) was completed and a paper was published. [Ed. Note. Reference: Haveman NJ, Khodadad CL, Dixit AR, Louyakis AS, Massa GD, Venkateswaran K, Foster JS. \"Evaluating the lettuce metatranscriptome with MinION sequencing for future spaceflight food production applications.\" npg Microgravity . 2021 Jun;7:22.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00151-x.]\nIn parallel, the full set of 24 lettuce samples (sanitized root and leaf samples at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days old) were sequenced via the Illumina NOVAseq 6000 platform. Sequencing was performed at the University of Florida, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR), and has been completed. The data obtained were run through an optimized bioinformatics pipeline (completed in YR2) and preliminary data for this study were obtained in YR2 as well. The data obtained show that root and leaf samples vary in their differential gene expression profiles and should be analyzed separately. A preliminary analysis of the lettuce leaf and root microbiome at various developmental time points has been established. Further pairwise comparisons between the abundance levels of the microbial communities for each developmental age are currently ongoing.\nFurther analysis of the transcriptome was performed in YR3 on this dataset and the differentially expressed genes (DEG) data have been gathered for each of the comparisons. In the data gathered, many more differentially expressed genes were observed in the root samples than in the leaf samples. Results show that the majority of statistically significant DEGs (padj < 0.05) in the roots can be seen in comparisons with Day 28, and therefore suggests that Day 28 has a substantially different metabolic and functional profile than the other developmental time points. In the leaf samples, the same trend was not observed. Although Day14 vs Day 28 showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes, other pairwise comparisons with Day 28 samples did not consistently show a substantial number of DEGs. Further comparisons of the individual genes are still ongoing.\nIn addition, a pilot study to optimize the sample processing method for the mizuna plants is ongoing. Findings from YR1 have shown that crop-specific ribosomal probes will need to be designed for the various host organisms to improve the removal of host RNAs and facilitate the microbial RNA enrichment process. In YR2, RNA from 28-day old mizuna leaf tissues have been extracted and several different commercially available ribosomal probes were tested. These samples have been shipped to our collaborator at Cornell University for sequencing, and data obtained will be used to validate the most effective method for enriching the mizuna microbial RNA. Due to COVID-19 and the shortage of laboratory supplies, our mizuna samples were not processed for quite a while. At the end of YR3, the sequencing of these samples for the pilot samples has been completed and data is currently being transferred to the Principal Investigator (PI) for further downstream bioinformatic analyses. The results gathered will identify the best method of removing plant ribosomal probes for future RNAseq library construction.\nObjective 2 – to develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways and signaling leading to plant growth enhancements and/or to plant/human pathogenesis identified from the metatranscriptomic data.\nMajor Outcomes:\nThe major outcomes of this objective were: 1) The metabolic pathways of the 28-day old lettuce leaf microbiome using MinION sequencing technology have been published. 2) Presence of potential bacterial genera and metabolic activity that could play a role as plant growth enhancers and plant pathogens were revealed. 3) Gene network analysis identified several genes within the fungal Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway that could be drivers of fungal pathogenesis. 4) The metabolic pathways of the lettuce leaf microbiome at all the various time points have been classified.\nDetails of work progress: In YR2, we have established the microbial populations found in the 28-day old lettuce leaves and the metabolic pathways that these microbes are utilizing. [Ed. Note. Reference: Haveman NJ, Khodadad CL, Dixit AR, Louyakis AS, Massa GD, Venkateswaran K, Foster JS. \"Evaluating the lettuce metatranscriptome with MinION sequencing for future spaceflight food production applications.\" npg Microgravity. 2021 Jun;7:22.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00151-x.]\nIn YR3, a similar approach was taken to evaluate the metabolic pathways for all the lettuce samples at various time points in their development. By looking at the pairwise comparison of differentially expressed genes for both the bacterial and fungal community, a sense of the pathways changing at each developmental time point can be inferred. The results of the changes in functional pathways of the leaf-bacterial community show that there are many diverse pathways differentially regulated between the 14-day old plants and the 28-day old plants. Genes associated with the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, energy, vitamins and cofactors, replication and repair, and signal transduction are differentially expressed between these two developmental time points. Similar analyses, between the bacterial community in the root tissues, are currently ongoing.\nObjective 3 – to develop methods for enhancing plant growth or suppressing the pathogenic activity without eradicating commensal or saprophytic microbes.\nThe results obtained from the 28-day old lettuce leaf microbial metatranscriptome analysis (with the MinION platform) have led to a potential strategy for the suppression of fungal plant pathogens. The taxonomy diversity data revealed the presence of several potential plant growth-promoting bacteria (such as Paenibacillus) and the presence of  fungal plant pathogens (such as Fusarium). Several studies have shown that Paenibacillus produces an antifungal compound that is active against Fusarium. So perhaps, one way to combat the Fusarium presence is to enhance the presence of Paenibacillus in the population.\nOther Projects Developing from this Grant:\nIn addition to the proposed project for this fellowship, an additional paper on using the MinION platform as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of an opportunistic fungal pathogen identified on the ISS was developed. [Ed. Note: see bibliography for pre-print information and upcoming print publication date.] In collaboration with Dr. Andrew Schuerger at the Space Life Sciences Lab (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center, a side experiment showing how the MinION platform can be used to accurately differentiate between Fusaria species was performed. The results show that the pipeline could differentiate between the kingdoms and species, and hence, strengthen the case for using the MinION platform as a rapid plant disease diagnostic tool in space.\nHaveman NJ and Schuerger AC.

            "task_description": "We propose a multi-omics study using the model plant Arabidopsis under both 1g and in microgravity conditions (spaceflight). Our approach spans comprehensive phenomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics strategies, and is incisively and uniquely melded via deployment of an integrated computational biology (ICB) approach we are pioneering. Our plant lines include wild type, various mutants we have generated with different lignin amounts through manipulation of the multigene family encoding arogenate dehydratases, and other lines enhanced in carbon assimilation capacity, and combinations thereof. We consider this places us in an unprecedented position to investigate how plants function in altered gravity environments.\nWe are very well positioned for incisive spaceflight and definition stage (1g) studies to investigate gene/metabolic network relationships and adaptations resulting from varying lignin and carbon assimilation levels, e.g., on photosynthesis; C allocation; water use efficiency (WUE); vascular plant growth/development; vasculature performance; auxin transport; and gravitational adaptations. Our  overarching hypothesis is that a comprehensive interrogation (an integrative omics study) of our Arabidopsis lines with varying lignin levels and/or modulated carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) or combination thereof will identify gene/metabolic networks, mechanisms and/or pathways that are differentially modulated at 1g and on exposure to microgravity, i.e., various omics (phenomics,  transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and ICB) will allow us to study these in a truly unprecedented way.\nOverall objectives:\n1. Establish multi “omics” effects of modulating lignin and CCM levels i) at 1g and ii) in spaceflight.\n2. Compare/contrast data, using an ICB approach, to better define and understand gravity sensing and responses, and if threshold/induction parameters are modified or changed, when lignin and CCM levels are varied.\nMore specifically, we address distinct hypotheses for our various teams, and integrate, dissect, and incisively analyze them holistically in a manner hitherto not possible. These 5 hypotheses include that: modulating lignin and CCM levels differentially affect carbon assimilation/re-allocation, photosynthesis, and WUE (Team 1); modulating lignin and CCM levels differentially affect secondary and primary metabolite levels (metabolomics) (Team 2); system-wide modification in the transcriptome occurs through a common transcriptional regulatory mechanism, and transcriptome/proteome “discrepancies” result from over-simplification of transcript analyses (Team 3); differential alterations in lignin and CCM levels can often be attributed to overall distinct changes in protein expression and phosphorylation patterns in a defined set of proteins (Team 4); an integrated omics analysis will provide urgently needed new insights into global effects on plant biological processes at both 1g and in microgravity (Teams 1-4). Each hypothesis draws upon the most advanced technologies available for study. We consider that our ICB approach will transform omics analysis through our advanced instrumentation and analytical tools. We will utilize (or design) computational tools/mathematical algorithms for integration and correlation of high resolution phenotype measurements (phenomics) with 'low' resolution global subcellular system measurements (transcriptomics, etc.) through 'nth' dimensional analysis.\nOur study aligns with Research Emphasis 1 and 3, and decadal survey elements in Cell, Microbial, and Molecular Biology (CMM-3, CMM-5), Organismal and Comparative Biology (OCB 2-5), Developmental Biology (DEV-4), and Plant and Microbial Biology, chapter 4 (P2).

            "task_progress": "Overview:\nComprehensive ‘multi-omics’ analyses of model plant species, thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), grown for up to circa 6 weeks duration after germination on International Space Station (ISS) with corresponding Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ground controls. [Multi-omics analyses refer to metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, phenomics, and (to the extent possible) anatomical analysis of lignified stems. A glossary of terms is at end of summary.]\nBiological Partners: Six Arabidopsis genotypes, wild type (WT) Columbia, Columbia modified ostensibly to increase plant biomass, and four lignin-reduced Columbia genotypes. Lignin provides plant cell wall reinforcement, thereby enabling plants to stand upright. Lignin-reduced genotypes, unable to stand upright, were utilized to determine whether structural lignin reinforcement was required in microgravity on ISS. These genotypes offered the exciting opportunity to investigate the central question as to whether there was a threshold lignin level needed for Arabidopsis to stand upright in microgravity.\nConsortium Team Partners: This included research scientists from Washington State University (WSU), University of New Mexico (UNM), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and ISS astronauts.\nObjectives and results:\n1). Establish “multi-omics’ effects of modulating lignin and carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) levels at 1g and in spaceflight on ISS; 2). Compare/contrast data, using an integrated computational biology (ICB) approach, to better define and understand gravity sensing and responses and if threshold/induction parameters are modified or changed when lignin and CCM levels were varied.\nPre-ISS consortium tasks successfully completed 2015-2018 in conjunction with KSC Payload Development Team (PDT):  Generated CCM genotype with small, but measurable, biomass increases and increased stem fiber cell wall thickness, whereas the lignin-reduced adt mutants had weakened vascular bundle cell walls; Established APH Science Carrier Arabidopsis growth conditions for KSC Science Verification Test (SVT), Experiment Verification Test (EVT), and ISS; Demonstrated Arabidopsis seed viability for prolonged storage (24 weeks) in Science Carriers; Identified transportation conditions to ISS for Arabidopsis seeds in Science Carrier, without seeds being dislodged during transit; Scientific/technical evaluation at KSC of suitability of hand-held photosynthesis measurement (FluorPen) device; Quality control criteria established for Arabidopsis tissue sample preparations for multi-omics analyses; Two multi-omics foundational analyses conducted using soil-grown Arabidopsis genotypes, as baseline studies to compare with ISS/KSC investigations.\nSoil-grown Arabidopsis lignin deficient genotypes had reductions in related secondary metabolite levels (flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, glucosinolate, and other metabolite classes). By contrast, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of corresponding biochemical pathway steps generally showed increased abundances, but such responses were ultimately futile in restoring either lignin or secondary metabolite levels.\nISS prototype APH flight unit installation and functional verification: Astronaut Ricky Arnold completed on-orbit Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) installation, with first power-up and 5-day functional checkout on December 01, 2017. Science Carrier with WT Arabidopsis and dwarf wheat seeds in the ISS APH prototype were then successfully flood filled. Plants seemingly looked healthy over a 37-day growth period in Spring 2018.\nISS and KSC Arabidopsis genotype sequential grow-outs: This was the inaugural investigation for the ISS APH prototype, and the project was named PH-01 by NASA personnel. 192 Arabidopsis rosette leaf and stem tissues were collected for multi-omics analyses at circa 6 week growth/development/lignification. Roots were not harvested as APH Science Carrier technical design precluded this.\nPH-01 Grow-out 1: 46 Arabidopsis plants (Day 45) harvested on ISS stored in –160 °C GLACIER freezer until return to Earth (Splashdown, Pacific Ocean, January 13, 2019), with frozen Arabidopsis samples transported and delivered to Institute of Biological Chemistry (IBC), Washington State University (WSU). Samples were immediately stored at –80 °C at WSU until needed. KSC Ground Control Arabidopsis tissues (from 46 plants) were transported/delivered in frozen form to IBC/WSU and stored as above.\nPH-01 Grow-out 2: PH-01 Grow-out 2 was highlighted in NASA’s first 8K video (1.2 M views to date since its release 5 years ago;\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/8k-science).\n43 similarly frozen plants, following harvesting on Day 45, were returned to Earth January 7, 2020, then transported/delivered frozen to IBC/WSU and stored as above. KSC Ground Control Arabidopsis tissues (from 40 plants) were also transported/delivered in frozen form to IBC/WSU and stored as above.\nAPH plant health, plant genotype validation, and APH functional performance assessments: Overhead and side camera images were used daily to assess plant health and growth, and stem orientations, during ISS and KSC Grow-outs. Plant growth was estimated by measuring rosette leaf areas, where it was concluded that ISS-grown plants lagged in growth/development relative to KSC counterparts. PAM photosynthesis measurements showed higher variability on ISS, relative to KSC, presumably reflecting higher stresses experienced on ISS. Both ISS and KSC grown Arabidopsis genotypes, nevertheless, all looked robust and healthy visually.   Stems of ISS lignin-reduced mutants were, however, unable to stand upright, and subsequently discovered have to abnormal stem vasculature cross-sections when compared to KSC grown specimens – all consistent with a higher lignin level threshold being needed to grow upright, even in microgravity. This was an unexpected finding, and opposite to conventional wisdom.\nArabidopsis tissues, for multi-omics analyses, had genotypes validated on return to Earth. Of the 192 specimens evaluated by PCR, 4 rosette leaf samples did not have the genotypes as assigned to their designated APH Science Carrier position number, and these were accordingly amended.\nISS and KSC ICB multi-omics analyses: The comprehensive analyses and ‘big data’ compilation represented a significant spaceflight (ISS) multi-omics ICB baseline study for Arabidopsis. However, meaningful integration of multi-omics data is a well-known problematic issue across all biology disciplines. Accordingly, our inter-disciplinary team effort focused upon integration and analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics (including initial emphasis on secondary and primary metabolites, lipids, and lignin). Our approach was designed to tease out key ISS spaceflight environment effects relative to KSC counterparts.\nICB metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics analyses: ISS lignin levels were generally lower than KSC Ground Controls and resulting from slower plant growth on ISS. Secondary metabolite (stem and rosette leaf) profiles for both ISS and KSC Grow-outs had similar profiles, with flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, glucosinolate, and shikimate-chorismate pathway levels generally becoming (increasingly) lower in lignin-deficient genotypes. The mainly primary metabolite analyses of stems established shikimic acid and phenylpropanoid levels on average also decreased in genotypes most lignin-deficient, relative to WT, for both stem/rosette leaf tissues in ISS/KSC Grow-outs 1 and 2. Aromatic amino acids, Phe and Tyr, in stems showed similar trends whereas in rosette leaves results were more varied for the same genotypes.  In contrast, bona fide biochemical steps for the above secondary metabolite pathways generally showed increased proteome and transcriptome abundances in lignin-deficient genotypes, but these were again futile in restoring either lignin or secondary metabolite WT genotype levels, whether ISS or KSC grown.\nTowards determining ICB transcriptomic and proteomic effects on photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and photorespiration: Our ICB approach also targeted photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and oxidative phosphorylation to evaluate whether photosynthesis and photorespiration were affected. Transcription profiles from Grow-out 2 (with transcripts from chloroplast and mitochondrial encoding proteins retained) indicated that Photosystems I and II subunits were down-regulated in a lignin-reduced genotype (ISS vs KSC), as were two rate-limiting Calvin cycle enzymes.  Our preliminary analysis of global transcript levels clearly revealed a dramatic shift in transcriptome machinery and Calvin cycle proteins, but it remains to be determined whether one or more mechanisms are responsible for the varied genotype responses to differing lignin contents. Proteomic analyses were apparently similar, together with indications that photorespiration had increased in lignin-deficient genotypes.\nTowards better understanding ICB transcriptomic and proteomic effects for radiation and DNA repair on ISS-grown Arabidopsis genotypes: Numerous genes associated with base/nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination were statistically differentially expressed (DE) in the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment. The largest lignin-deficient mutants had more DE, suggesting different genotype responses to increased radiation in the ISS spaceflight environment. Proteins related to radiation damage repair in ISS Grow-out 1 also increased in abundance, as compared to KSC counterparts. DNA repair and recombination proteins, DNA replication, and homologous recombination proteins were additionally affected. This observation may suggest that plants with reduced lignin levels were more prone to DNA damage in the ISS spaceflight environment.\nTowards determining ICB single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects on ISS grown Arabidopsis genotypes: Our transcription analysis unexpectedly suggest that mutation rates might be lower in ISS vs KSC samples. This was unexpected given the ISS spaceflight environment (including radiation and microgravity) experienced. A provisional hypothesis for these results includes possibility of over-expression of DNA repair mechanisms resulting from exposure to the ISS spaceflight environment. This would be consistent with the observed differential regulation of DNA repair mechanisms observed. Such over-expression could cause more mutations to be corrected, as compared to the baseline rate of mutations observed with KSC samples. Alternatively, ISS plants were possibly more stressed due to microgravity and increased radiation, thereby (at least in part) causing slower organismal growth rates. Slower growth rates would correspond to slower and fewer cell divisions, which could conceivably reduce the number of observed mutations across all cells in each tissue sample.\nTowards correlating ICB proteomic and transcriptomic ISS spaceflight responses as regards cell signaling and microbial perception/susceptibility for ISS Arabidopsis genotypes: Initial analysis of differential expression observed in ISS (as compared to KSC) samples revealed more differential regulation in leaf compared to stem tissues. This trend was present in both transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, albeit to a lesser extent with protein abundance differences. Functional Term enrichment analysis showed photosynthesis-related proteins significantly down-regulated in leaf samples on ISS compared to KSC, this being consistent with previous studies of plant responses to stress conditions.   Up-regulation at the transcript level for leaf samples on ISS was concentrated in signaling, and related genes, as well as genes involved in systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Various proteins related to cell signaling followed the same trend and increased in abundance in Arabidopsis plants with least lignin contents. For stem samples on ISS, no GO terms were significantly enriched among protein sets, but for transcriptomic features, down-regulation of growth and development and up-regulation of defense responses and signaling highlighted the list of regulatory differences. Several disease resistant proteins, and precursors to a hypersensitive response (HR), were significantly upregulated, perhaps suggesting attempted acclimation to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment.  Exosome and membrane trafficking proteins are often involved in protection against pathogenic attack. As lignification also plays a role in plant-pathogen/microbial defenses, it may be that ISS grown plants with reduced lignin levels are more prone to increased pathogen susceptibility in the spaceflight ISS microgravity environment.\nTowards completion of IBC multi-omics analyses and visualization: Significant progress was made in integrating/comparing the diverse multi-omics datasets to gain both new and comprehensive insights into the systems-level response(s) to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment with the six Arabidopsis genotypes. Metabolomics data was used as a cross-check.  Pathway analysis used targeted and untargeted approaches. The former involved extracting features from each dataset associated with various structural (biochemical) pathways and comparing fold changes in ISS vs KSC across genotypes. The latter involved use of a LANL developed tool OPaver (Omics Pathway Viewer). Opaver enabled us to map differential expression/abundance values onto curated KEGG pathway maps for multi-omics datasets. Our analysis to date indicates that some metabolic pathways were augmented by the ISS spaceflight environment conditions vs KSC, but analysis is still ongoing.\nOutreach:\nOutreach was an important component of this ISS/KSC study, but with no direct support from the NASA supported project here. The Outreach components are summarized further below.\nSummary and future steps: An important and continuing contribution was in providing the best possible multi-omics integration analyses for the various Arabidopsis genotypes grown on ISS and at KSC. Our massive datasets and other documentation, although embargoed until publication, are currently being provided to NASA Gene Lab for curation, as well as to data repositories required for publication. It is anticipated that our multi-omics integration will continue to take an additional 12 months or so to fully complete – including giving additional attention to effects of radiation on ISS and potentially different effects on the various Arabidopsis genotypes.   Ongoing analyses include determining the full extent of physiological modulations induced in the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment, by: 1) more detailed mapping of transcripts to specific intra-cellular compartments (i.e. chloroplast, mitochondria, etc.) in order to more fully understand how microgravity on ISS modulates various metabolic pathways; 2) deducing what trends may be uniquely attributed to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment; 3) further addressing the proposal hypotheses that system-wide modifications noted in ADT KO and WT Arabidopsis genotypes may be caused (in part) through a common transcriptional regulatory mechanism.\nGlossary: Metabolomics here included analyses and quantification of secondary metabolites (many with plant defense functions), lipids (largely fatty, waxy, or oily compounds), primary metabolites (considered essential for plant growth and development), and lignin. Transcriptomics and proteomics were used for detection of gene expression and corresponding protein/enzyme profiles (and their individual abundances) at the circa 6 week harvesting stage for both ISS and KSC Grow-outs. Phenomics included photosynthesis measurements using a hand-held pulse-amplitude monitoring (PAM) device, used for the first time on ISS, as well as in monitoring of rosette leaf tissue areas and of ‘bolting’ stem orientations during Arabidopsis growth/development/lignification. Cell wall anatomical analyses of both ISS and KSC Arabidopsis stems were used to determine whether ISS grown Arabidopsis stem vasculature differed from corresponding KSC Ground Controls.\nUnexpected setbacks: Germination and plant death/dying difficulties were experienced in both ISS Grow-outs. This required analysis of ISS APH functionality data records, as such difficulties did not occur during KSC Grow-outs. It was concluded that there was uneven APH watering in growing all needed plant genotypes and, in particular, for ISS Grow-out 1, as well as intermittent ISS APH partial lighting failures for Grow-out 2. Furthermore, analysis of water availability at different growth positions in the APH on ISS was a complication that can hopefully be better teased out from further analyses of multi-omics and ISS APH data for both Grow-outs. In both cases, together with slower growth on ISS, only one 6 week harvest was possible for multi-omics analyses.\nSupplementary (Publications to Date, Newsletters, Seminars/Lectures, Presentations, Significant Media Coverage, Training, and Outreach)\nPublications:\nHöhner, R., Marques, J.V., Ito, T., Amakura, Y., Budgeon, A.D., Jr., Weitz, K., Hixson, K.K., Davin, L.B., Kirchhoff, H., and Lewis, N.G.  2018.

He carried out/refined Arabidopsis growth conditions using the Science Carrier that was to be fitted into the APH. The Washington State Space Grant Consortium kindly provided supplementary support for both high school and undergraduate participation. Mr. Pezeshki successfully completed his Senior Project, and which led to several successful outcomes. He gave two posters (one at WSU for the University Showcase, and a second one in October 2017 in Seattle at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) in a session for High School students nationwide). He was also supported by a travel grant from ASGSR to present his work.  Some of Mr. Pezeshki’s activities included:\n•\tSieving, washing, and autoclaving of Turface arcillite particles used as the growing substrate for plants on board ISS, as well as preparation of foam and gauze templates to support the seeds and plants in the final assembly of the Science Carrier unit.\n•\tRecording and editing videos to present to NASA KSC personnel, so that they could review our plant harvesting and processing methods used for RNA, protein, and metabolite extraction. These videos were instrumental for assessing constraints involved in foil pack dimensions required for plant samples for adequate preservation during storage and for rapid processing upon return to Earth. This was helpful for developing procedures necessary for optimizing astronaut crew time spent on harvesting and critical storage of samples in the limited freezer container space aboard ISS.\n•\tAssistance with transgenic plant sample preparation for PCR gene screening analysis. This involved DNA extraction from freshly harvested plant leaves, and use of these samples as DNA templates for the PCR mixtures. Samples were amplified using a thermocycler instrument and then run on an agarose gel for a qualitative analysis assessment.\n•\tDeveloping protocols for harvesting and processing different parts of Arabidopsis plants which included separating leaves, stems, siliques, flowers, etc., and then later on grinding tissues and preparing extracts suitable for our multi-omics studies. He continuously assisted in preparing plant tissue samples for metabolomic analysis. He also prepared a video presentation on this that was also very helpful for the NASA scientists/astronauts by recording this entire process beginning from harvest to extraction.\n•\tStudying effects of humidity on metabolite levels at different harvest times. Mr. Pezeshki individually processed leaf and stem tissues of four and six weeks old Arabidopsis wild type plants grown under low and high humidity conditions. He studied the growth and development (stem length and weight) of Arabidopsis wild type plants harvested at different time intervals. He also successfully completed this experiment without assistance. After he had expertise in preparing tissue samples suitable for metabolomics, he was assigned to study the metabolomics of NASA-SVT (Science verification test) samples.\nPhD students Kim K. Hixson, Qingyan Meng and Jorgen Tacetta: Both K.K. Hixson and Q. Meng completed their PhD degrees (N. G. Lewis, Advisor) in the Molecular Plant Sciences program, Washington State University. Dr. Hixson is currently a Senior Research Scientist at PNNL, and Dr. Meng is a Research Associate in the Lewis Laboratory).  Jorgen Tacetta is in good standing in his Ph.D. studies.\nOutreach:\n•\tThe New Mexico Space Grant Consortium helped to fund a year-long collaboration between Dr. Hanson and the Explora science museum in Albuquerque. They developed and piloted a monthly course called \"Extraterrestrial Botany\" for around twenty students across the city who were in 5th through 9th grade. Ten sessions were developed and taught by a team of 2 post docs (1 female), two technicians (both female, 1 Hispanic), a female graduate student, and three undergraduates (2 female, 1 Hispanic), plus Dr. Hanson and two staff members at Explora. The project involved learning about challenges of space exploration, relevance for life on Earth, and the student assisted with data collection and analysis from the APH-01. Feedback from families and Explora was extremely positive.\n•\tDavid Hanson was lead organizer for a NASA supported In-flight Education Downlink with Astronaut Christina Koch on International Space Station (\nhttps://news.unm.edu/news/nasa-astronaut-chats-live-with-500-students-at-unm).\nThis event had an audience of over 700 people, including over 500 K-12 students that traveled to UNM to participate in person - as well as others watching via an internet live stream (live.unm.edu). The event had many hands-on activity booths from local STEM education programs and guest presentations by NASA scientists and student interns. It was also co-hosted by The Children’s Hour radio program and part of a subsequent hour-long show that was broadcast nationwide. Research from PH-01 was highlighted in the live event (found online at live.unm.edu as well as directly through the NASA past downlinks site-\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/stem-on-station/downlinks.html)\nand on the radio show (\nhttps://www.childrenshour.org/kids-in-space/).\n•\tNorman G. Lewis and Laurence B. Davin partnered with Ms. Kathy Lucchesi (K-7/8 teacher), at McCaffrey Middle School in Galt, California, and their largely Hispanic students. Supplemental funding was provided to the school by NASA and the California Space Grant Consortium so that these middle school students could safely follow and utilize many of the plant growth and development protocols developed for the ISS experiments. One purpose was that the students could  grow plants under similar conditions and obtain information and insights on how the research impacts or benefits life on Earth and beyond (in the future).\no\tDrs. Lewis (Washington State University) and Dr. Sato (NASA Ames) visited McCaffrey Middle School on September 28, 2017, to see first-hand the work underway. Both visitors gave talks on the project, as well as the broader ramifications of NASA research.\no\tThe Galt Herald wrote an article on this visit (\nhttp://www.galtheraldonline.com/news/mccaffrey-students-reach-for-the-stars-in-a-joint-experiment/article_b7047f9e-a93e-11e7-b016-d79e90b47bc5.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=user-share)\n, and the student’s progress was further publicized through the NASA Space Biology Facebook (\nhttps://www.facebook.com/spacebiology/).\no\tProgress with the students was also followed through regular Skype and/or FaceTime team meetings, with Drs. Lewis, Davin, and Costa (WSU). Dr. Hanson (University of New Mexico) provided tutorials on photosynthesis and the use of a FluorPen for their studies.\no\tWritten materials on, and seeds for, the experiments at hand were also routinely provided. The additional aim was in helping teach and inspire these young students about the joys and fun of the scientific method in experimental plant biology. Periodically, middle school students presented results to Dr. Lewis over where such work was being routinely evaluated.\no\tAstronaut Sunita Williams, Dr. Lewis (WSU IBC) and Dr. Sato (NASA Ames) visited the school on April 13, 2018. Astronaut Williams gave presentations on her time on International Space Station and answered questions from students.  The Galt Herald (\nhttp://www.galtheraldonline.com/news/mccaffrey-students-visited-by-space-explorer/article_144aa81a-4334-11e8-842f-f7106ee5d2d7.html)\nand the Lodi News-Sentinel (www.lodinews.com/news/article_982e5434-3faa-11e8-b4e1-db589601c0df.html?mode=story) wrote articles on her visit, and the visit was further publicized through the NASA Space Biology Facebook (\nhttps://www.facebook.com/spacebiology/).\no\t McCaffrey Middle School Students also presented their work on #PlantHabitat01 to the Galt School Board on  (See post at:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/spacebiology/posts/917222148451703).\no\tMs. Lucchesi, her students, and Dr. Lewis visited NASA AMES Research Center, May 28, 2018.

            "task_description": "Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:\n(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.\n(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.\nThe BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants."

            "task_progress": "The flight component of this project is awaiting the availability of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware and an associated flight opportunity. Fresh seed stocks have been maintained and validated for all the genotypes for the experiment and are regularly being tested for germination and growth characteristics to be ready for a potential flight opportunity.\nWork has continued to characterize how spaceflight conditions such as hypoxic stress might be influencing plant defense capabilities. Flooding stress and hypoxia are thought to be important elements of the plant spaceflight environment due to the loss of both gravity-driven water flow and buoyancy-driven convection in the microgravity of space. On Earth, flooding stress is thought to lead to shifts in defense capabilities against pathogens, priming the plant to defend itself more effectively once the flooding stress has subsided. Additionally, flooding is thought to suppress responses to herbivory and mechanical damage. Previous spaceflight data from the Advanced Plant Experiments-05 (APEX-05) experiment have been analyzed and combined with ground-based studies. Previous work has shown that when the CAX2 vacuolar Ca2+ transporter is knocked out, plants become resistant to flooding stress on Earth. These same CAX2 knockouts were grown on the International Space Station (the APEX-05 flight experiment). Analysis of patterns of gene expression from the APEX-05 data indicated that the wild type plants exhibited molecular signatures of hypoxia and oxidative stress while growing in space. These changes were coupled to alterations in patterns of gene expression associated with response to both pathogen-attack and physical damage, or herbivory effects that were not seen in the cax2 mutant. Ground-based experiments showed that a hypoxic stress of ~6% oxygen can mimic many of these spaceflight-related events.\nAn additional major effect of spaceflight on the cax2 mutant was a large-scale shift in patterns of gene expression towards those related to cell wall biogenesis, maintenance, and remodeling in the shoot. Glycome profiling was therefore used to catalog cell wall polymer composition. Glycomics uses a suite of monoclonal antibodies to quantify the non-cellulosic cell wall polymer composition through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay. This profiling revealed spaceflight-triggered increases in wall polymers such as xyloglucans and pectins in both wild type and the cax2 mutant. However, a notable difference between the two genotypes was that, in wild type, spaceflight induced upregulation of the xylan components of the wall in only roots; whereas in the cax2 mutant, this change was shifted to being exclusively in the shoot tissues. The xylan content of the wall plays a key role in both structural support and in maintaining a resilient physical barrier for plant defense, indicating a likely major shift in these features is being elicited by growth in space. These results further suggest that the regulatory networks governing these changes to the wall are strongly influenced by the action of the CAX2 gene, potentially through its role in Ca2+-based signaling of hypoxic stress.",

The previous PI was Dr. Elison Blancaflor, Noble Research Institute, from July 2018-March 2021.\nPlants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent \"omics\" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This proposal aims to gain a better mechanistic understanding of how plant roots function at the cellular and molecular levels. A primary focus of the proposed work is to ask how the microgravity environment modulates the directionality of root growth. Because roots are essential for the uptake of water and nutrients, knowledge gained from successful implementation of the proposed work will be crucial in guiding pre-breeding efforts aimed toward the development of crops with improved productivity through better and more efficient root systems. Thus, agriculture on Earth is one beneficial outcome of this project."

            "task_progress": "OVERVIEW:\nThis research has used microgravity analogs to test hypotheses about plant responses to reduced gravity generated from the previous plant-focused spaceflight research campaigns of Biological Research in Canisters-16 (BRIC-16) and Advanced Plant Experiments-03 (APEX-03-1). BRIC-16 and APEX-03-1 revealed that microgravity had a profound effect on root growth directionality, cell wall structure and composition, and the expression of a suite of root-specific genes involved in regulating cell wall function. Moreover, this research implicated the actin cytoskeleton as a major player in modulating root growth in microgravity. These observations led to the overarching hypothesis tested in this current research project that microgravity modifies root growth directionality in large part by modifying the expression of genes that link the actin cytoskeleton to structural remodeling of the cell wall. To test this hypothesis the following specific aims were pursued:\nSpecific Aim 1. Immunocytochemistry of selected cell wall components in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) seedlings grown on the clinostat to simulate a microgravity environment.\nSpecific Aim 2. Characterizing autotropic root straightening in maize roots in response to brassinolide (BL) - and latrunculin B (LatB) - induced actin disruption.\nSpecific Aim 3. Evaluation of root growth of selected Arabidopsis thaliana actin/cell wall-related mutants grown in simulated microgravity generated through clinorotation.\nRESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS:\nSPECIFIC AIM 1. Immunocytochemistry of selected cell wall components in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on a slowly rotating clinostat. Status: completed.\nThe APEX-03 experiment grew plants on the International Space Station for either 6 or 11 days. These samples were returned for glycomic analysis of cell wall polymer composition. Glycomics uses enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify non-cellulosic cell wall polymer levels via a battery of monoclonal antibodies raised against specific cell wall components. APEX-03 also returned fixed materials allowing for confirmation of the ELISA results using immunocytochemistry. Xyloglucans are the most common hemicellulose in dicot cell walls and the glycomics provided a survey-level monitoring of wall composition that highlighted xyloglucans as likely being modified in spaceflight.\nTo validate these results, 22 of the monoclonal antibodies that recognized a range of wall polymers including xyloglucan, xylan, and arabinogalactan epitopes were chosen from the glycomics analysis. These antibodies were then used for immunocytochemistry to localize where these polymers were likely to be changing. These analyses revealed the spatial patterning underlying the spaceflight-triggered changes suggested by the glycomics survey. For example, the XG-4 non-fucosylated-xyloglucan recognized by antibody M58 was found to be most intensely deposited in the periphery of the spaceflight-grown roots, whereas the xylan backbone epitope recognized by antibody M140 was more intensely labeled in the xylem of space-grown roots. These results suggest that the spaceflight environment triggers changes in xyloglucan-related polymer production, where distinct spatial patterning of their production is an important element of the response (Nakashima et al., 2023).\nThe samples used for glycomics were also used to extract RNA for parallel transcriptomic profiling. Analysis of this APEX-03 RNAseq data was made using the iDEP2.1 platform with a false discovery rate set to <0.05 and a fold-change cutoff of 1.5x. This study revealed distinctly different spaceflight-responsive transcriptome profiles of root versus shoot tissues that changed in the plants sampled at day 11 compared to those harvested at day 6. Gene ontology enrichment analysis highlighted cell walls as a likely important element of these transcriptional responses\nThe glycomics results from aim 1 showed change in xyloglucan-related wall polymers is triggered by growth in spaceflight. However, analysis of the expression patterns of the 13 genes that form the xyloglucan biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis from the APEX-03 RNAseq data do not support the hypothesis that transcriptional regulation of this pathway explains these changes in cell wall biochemistry. It is likely that spaceflight is altering cell wall structure through effects on post-transcriptional regulatory events.\nSPECIFIC AIM 2. Characterize autotropic root straightening in maize roots in response to brassinolide (BL)- and latrunculin B (LatB)-induced actin disruption. Status: completed at the Noble Research Institute.\nThis research revealed that the plant hormone, epi-Brassinolide (eBL) is involved in autotropic root straightening post gravistimulation through its effects on F-actin in roots of maize (Zea mays). Treatment with eBL resulted in the over-shooting of the bending of roots after a gravity stimulus was removed by placing the plants on the clinostat. This effect was caused by clinorotation-linked disruption of F-actin organization and dynamics. This outcome was published in the journal, Frontiers in Plant Science (de Bang et al., 2020). This work has also led to the development of live cell actin reporters in M. truncatula. Plants were genetically engineered to stably express Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP that produced high quality labeling of the actin cytoskeleton in roots and leaves with minimal disruption in overall growth. These transgenic lines were then used to study the effect of eBL on F-actin in M. truncatula root cells (de Bang et al., 2020). Additionally, methods have been developed for live cell imaging of F-actin reporters in A. thaliana and M. truncatula that were published as a chapter in the book, Cytoskeleton Methods and Protocol (Chai et al., 2022). [Ed. Note: For complete citations, see References below and Cumulative Bibliographies under PI Gilroy (Grant #80NSSC22K0029) and former PI Blancaflor (Grant #80NSSC18K1462).]\nSPECIFIC AIM 3. Evaluate root growth of selected Arabidopsis thaliana actin/cell wall-related mutants on microgravity simulators. Status: completed.\nThree recessive, non-allelic actin-related mutants have been isolated from a T-DNA mutagenized population of A. thaliana in a forward genetic screen for increased sensitivity of root growth inhibition to LatB. This research avenue started in previous NASA-funded research, Gramt #NNX12AM94G, to find novel players in actin-regulated root growth by searching for LatB hypersensitivity. These mutants were named hypersensitive to LatB (hlb) 1, 2, and 3. The hlb1 mutation was mapped to a gene of unknown function that encoded a protein with a six tetratricopeptide repeat motif structure during the previous funding. Analyses characterized it to have functions in modulation of actin dynamics at the trans-Golgi network/ early endosome, resulting in a publication in The Plant Cell (Sparks et al., 2016). Continuing this work, the hlb3 mutation has now been mapped to exon 2 of the gene, FORMIN HOMOLOGY 20 that is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. This work involved using a new tool, TDNAscan, that demonstrated improved accuracy in the identification of complete and truncated T-DNA insertions, and was published in Frontiers in Genetics (Sun et al., 2019). The hlb2 mutation has now also been mapped to the gene, SPIRRIG (SPI). Characterization of its function showed it played a key role in the regulation of root hair elongation by maintaining F-actin dynamics at the site of active root hair growth (Chin et al., 2021).\nIn parallel studies to the LatB hypersensitive mutants, analyses have been performed on the effect of growth in simulated microgravity on root growth and orientation of actin mutants: act2-3, act7-4, act8-4, act2-3 act8-2, along with knockout mutants in SPI. Simulated microgravity was generated using custom-built 2-D clinostats. Previous research has shown that mutants in ACT2 consistently showed strong root skewing and coiling responses in spaceflight during BRIC-16 (Nakashima et al., 2014). This current analysis has further revealed that ACT2 (and potentially SPI) as a key player, required for the inhibition of root growth and enhanced skewing triggered by growth in simulated microgravity on the clinostat.\nIN SUMMARY, the major findings from this research have been: (1) Spaceflight is associated with a remodeling of the plant cell wall with major effects on xyloglucan polymer levels likely controlled at the post-transcriptional level; (2) The actin cytoskeleton is a major driver of root elongation and gravity-driven directional growth, with key roles for actin isoform 2 and the SPIRRIG protein; (3) Root straightening after gravstimulation is regulated through brassinosteroid and actin-dependent processes.\nREFERENCES\nNakashima J, Liao F, Sparks J A, Tang Y, Blancaflor EB (2014) The actin cytoskeleton is suppressor of the endogenous skewing behaviour of Arabidopsis primary roots in microgravity.

            "task_description": "Significance of objectives to NASA and this Solicitation: Deep space exploration or extraterrestrial colonization (e.g., Moon or Mars) will require the ability to sustainably produce plants for human/animal consumption, as well as providing aesthetic benefits of plant life to future crews and personnel in extra-terrestrial colonies. One key challenge in spaceflight/microgravity is in overcoming long-standing difficulties in efficaciously providing water and nutrients to germinating and maturing plants. Another important research challenge that has seen little attention is in productively exploiting beneficial plant-microbe interactions in spaceflight/microgravity, particularly for nitrogen (N) fixation. When both challenges are resolved for optimal, productive, and efficacious plant growth in space, this will provide the exciting opportunity to recycle organically bound carbon (C) and N that was sequestered in these plants. Through subsequent recycling of those organics (e.g., derived from human and animal consumption waste and from unused plant parts), this will help enable sustainable plant growth over multiple generations. Another benefit of studying beneficial plant microbe interactions is at the fundamental science level, i.e., by gaining much improved understanding of how the spaceflight/microgravity environment affects this important physiological process.\nCentral objectives of proposed research: Complementary purposes of our 2 Specific Aims are to initially dissect, understand, and optimize plant growth/development in spaceflight/microgravity via exploiting beneficial plant-microbe interactions. Then to ultimately recycle organic C and N from them suitable for subsequent multiple plant generations. To do this, we will use model Medicago plant species (e.g., alfalfa), and its beneficial bacterial symbiont, which together can potentially displace the need for N-containing fertilizer in spaceflight/microgravity.\nSpecific Aims:\n1. Comprehensively compare and contrast efficacy of beneficial symbiotic plant-microbe interactions between Medicago and Sinorhizobium growing on the International Space Station (ISS) and on Earth (NASA Kennedy Space Center/KSC), including understanding changes occurring at the molecular level;\n2. Compare  and  contrast  ease  of  biodegradation  of  the ISS  and  Earth  grown  Medicago  plant  material, in order to assess whether there are any differences in the ability to recycle C, N, etc. for multiple generations of plant growth/development.\nJustification for this work is threefold: The first is to demonstrate that beneficial plant microbe interactions during N-fixation can be efficaciously achieved in spaceflight/microgravity. The second is to gain a fundamental understanding of spaceflight/microgravity environment effects on these beneficial plant microbe interactions, and their potential usage for deep space exploration and colonization. The third is to demonstrate that organic C and N can be facilely recycled to support multiple generations of plant growth in space.\nMethods/techniques: During growth, FluorPen and plant size measurements will be carried out to assess comparative N-fixation efficacy for each condition, both on the ISS and on Earth.  Tissues (leaf, stem, and root) from the ISS and Earth control will be collected after ca. 6-8 weeks growth, frozen (-160°C). They will be subjected to transcriptomic and metabolomic (including amino acid) analyses; the microbiomes present in aerial/underground tissues will be determined. The multi-omics approaches employed are as for our Arabidopsis study.\nMedicago plant material, from the ISS and ground control, will also be subjected to biodegradation to establish whether there are any differences in N-mineralization (for recycling) in spaceflight/microgravity or ground control tissues.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Among the benefits on Earth envisaged: improving our knowledge of N-fixing process and the symbiosis between Medicago and Sinorhizobium, and determining optimal lignin contents for space and Earth will be very instructive, as will the recycling C/N capabilities for both wild type and genetically modified plant lines. Demonstrating this in space is also a very effective means of demonstrating to aspiring young scientists (including Middle and High School students) and others of the importance of plant life, of N-fixation, and of C/N recycling in a sustainable manner."

            "task_progress": "Progress on Experiment Verification Test (EVT) Preparation and Execution\nEVT2 used 2 Veggie units each housing twelve Plant Growth Systems (PGSs).  Twelve had an alfalfa reduced-lignin line and its corresponding control (VEGGIE 1; lignin experiment), whereas the other twelve had M. sativa v. Ladak (VEGGIE 2; symbiosis experiment).  [Ed. Note: The Vegetable Production System (\"Veggie\") is a plant growth unit on the International Space Station (ISS).]\nFor VEGGIE #1 (lignin experiment), the overall goal is to compare and contrast the ease of biodegradation of alfalfa grown on the ISS and Earth, including low-lignin alfalfa plants.  This is to assess whether there are differences in the ability to recycle C, N, etc., for multiple generations of plant growth/development.  Alfalfa was grown with added nitrogen.\nFor VEGGIE #2 (symbiosis experiment), the hypothesis is that rhizobia will be able to generate good plant growth and root nodulation in plant growth medium lacking an added nitrogen source.  There are 3 experimental configurations to test this hypothesis:\n1. Rhizobia (Sinorhizobium meliloti) added: This configuration should generate good plant growth and root nodulation in a plant growth medium lacking added nitrogen.\n2. No rhizobia or added nitrogen source in plant growth medium: In this configuration, the plants should be stunted because they lack access to a usable nitrogen source.\n3. No rhizobia, but added nitrogen source: This configuration is to test the growth of the plants when supplied with nitrogen-containing fertilizer.\nMembers of the Principal Investigator (PI) team travelled to NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) June 2, 2024 and 24 PGSs were assembled. A Magenta box was next placed on the top of each PGS.\nThe EVT2 was initiated June 5, 2024 by addition of nutrient solution (140 ml) to each PGS.  Each PGS was weighed before and after addition of nutrient solution.  This was done at this stage in order to estimate nutrient solution loss (due to plant growth and evaporation) over time.\nAs the nutrient solution was dispensed, the PGSs were next placed in both Veggie systems in the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber.  Light intensity and photoperiod were set. Temperature, relative humidity (RH) and CO2 level settings used in the ISSES chamber were those of “ISS average”.\nTemperature, RH, and CO2 levels were recorded daily by KSC personnel, with averages of each being 22.4 °C, 38.4%, and 4,368 ppm, respectively.\nIn addition, two HOBO Data Loggers (one in each Veggie system) were programmed to measure and record temperature, RH, and light at 15-minute intervals during plant growth.  Pictures were taken on day 8, and every 2-3 days thereafter until harvest.\nEight days after initiation (DAI) of the experiment, the top Magenta box on each PGS was removed.  Additional water was provided at day 10, and every 2 to 3 days thereafter until harvest, with weights again taken before and after adding water.  Germination rate (10 DAI) and number of plants that grew in each PGS were recorded.\nAlfalfa plants were harvested on July 05 and 19, 2024, respectively; i.e., 30 and 44 days after initiation (DAI).  Germination rate observed was 81% and 84% in Veggie 1 and 2, respectively, on average. Biomass yields were as follows:\n•  Total aerial (stem and leaf) biomass range (fresh weight): Veggie 1: 0.8 – 6.1 g;  Veggie 2: 1.2 – 4.3 g (excludes the no rhizobium, no nitrogen plant experiment).\n•  Total root biomass range (fresh weight): Veggie 1: 0.2 – 1.7 g; Veggie 2: 0.4 – 1.3 g (excludes the no rhizobium, no nitrogen plant experiment).\n•  Number of nodules: 24 – 73.\n•  Quality of DNA/total RNA extracted was ranked as high, between 7.9 and 7.1.\nIn summary, success criteria were both met, and fell into the Excellent sub-category.",

We hypothesize that these genes will reveal novel contributors to gravity perception, signal transduction, and response regulation. We have already completed the necessary RNA-Seq-based contrast analysis and have genes lists in hand to be further studied. The roles and contributions of these genes will be systematically tested in the project proposed here through a series of physiological, cell biological, and molecular screens using knockout mutants. Each mutant will be systematically tested for a gravity-related phenotype using high-resolution image analysis approaches developed in the Principal Investigator's lab. The role of the gene product in controlling differential auxin transport will be assessed by introducing an auxin reporter gene into each mutant background and quantifying expression of the reporter using confocal microscopy. The results of these screens will allow for the mapping of each gene product onto the gravity response pathway, leading to significant insights into plant gravity signaling in support of the development of gravity-altered plants tuned for future spaceflight missions.",

            "task_progress": "The Starch Statolith theory is the accepted mechanism of gravity sensing in plants and states that dense, starch-filled plastids sediment to the lowest region of the sensing cell. This sedimentation serves as a positional cue and initiates a growth response to reorient the primary root toward the direction of gravity. Despite the primacy of statolith sedimentation, previous research showed that starchless mutants display a persistent, albeit slower, response to gravity. This project identified 124 genes in Arabidopsis that show contrasting expression between wild type and starchless mutants during root gravitropism, representing potential novel contributors to gravity sensing and/or response in roots. The overarching goal of this project was to identify knockout mutants in as many of these genes as possible and test them for differences in gravity response compared to wild type roots.\nWe successfully identified 96 T-DNA knockout mutants and subjected them to a range of experimental tests to determine their root gravity response. Some of the mutants failed to germinate or grow adequately to test, resulting in complete data for 76 of the lines. We carried out 2 main kinds of gravity response experiments. In one type, roots were rotated 90 degrees from vertical and allowed to respond back toward vertical while images were captured every 10 min for 220 min. In this kind of experiment, called a free response, 26 of the mutants showed a response that differed significantly from the wild type, with most showing a reduced response. In the other type of experiment, roots were initially rotated 90 degrees from vertical as in the free response type, but were then continuously rotated at a rate of 15 deg/h. This experiment was done to test the root’s ability to respond to continuous stimulation. In this continuous rotation experiment, 20 mutants showed a response that differed significantly from the wild type. Interestingly, only 8 of the 26 mutants showing a significant difference in the free response experiment also showed a significant response in the continuous rotation experiments, indicating the effectiveness of the two assays at identifying different aspects of the gravity response pathway.\nMutants that showed a significant gravity response difference were crossed into the starchless mutant background to begin the process of making double mutants for analysis. It is hypothesized that if a gene product contributes to the starchless plants’ ability to sense or respond to gravity, this ability will be more severely affected in the starchless root background. Of the 38 total mutants, successful F1 seeds have been harvested for 18 thus far and work is continuing on this objective. Of the F1 lines confirmed, 6 have been carried out to the F3 generation for scoring and identification of double homozygous alleles. These lines will be subjected to the same free response and continuous rotation experiments after they are obtained.\nIn addition to creating double mutants with significant mutants, they were also crossed into the R2D2 semi-quantitative auxin reporter line. One of the regulators of growth and gravitropism, the cellular levels of the plant hormone auxin can be inferred using this fluorescent reporter. The fluorescent reporter protein in this system is targeted for degradation when auxin enters a cell, thus allowing the tracking of its disappearance as an indicator of auxin transport. The reporter also includes a second fluorescent protein that is not able to be targeted for degradation, thus allowing the ratiometric measurement of the two proteins as an internal control. Thus far, 12 F1 lines have been identified and 4 F3 lines have been used for pilot research. This molecular tool will allow for the determination of auxin transport in the mutants and the mapping of the gene product to a point in the gravity response pathway.",

Our plant lines include wild type, various mutants we have generated with different lignin amounts through manipulation of the multigene family encoding arogenate dehydratases, and other lines enhanced in carbon assimilation capacity, and combinations thereof. We consider this places us in an unprecedented position to investigate how plants function in altered gravity environments.\nWe are very well positioned for incisive spaceflight and definition stage (1g) studies to investigate gene/metabolic network relationships and adaptations resulting from varying lignin and carbon assimilation levels, e.g., on photosynthesis; C allocation; water use efficiency (WUE); vascular plant growth/development; vasculature performance; auxin transport; and gravitational adaptations. Our  overarching hypothesis is that a comprehensive interrogation (an integrative omics study) of our Arabidopsis lines with varying lignin levels and/or modulated carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) or combination thereof will identify gene/metabolic networks, mechanisms and/or pathways that are differentially modulated at 1g and on exposure to microgravity, i.e., various omics (phenomics,  transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and ICB) will allow us to study these in a truly unprecedented way.\nOverall objectives:\n1. Establish multi “omics” effects of modulating lignin and CCM levels i) at 1g and ii) in spaceflight.\n2. Compare/contrast data, using an ICB approach, to better define and understand gravity sensing and responses, and if threshold/induction parameters are modified or changed, when lignin and CCM levels are varied.\nMore specifically, we address distinct hypotheses for our various teams, and integrate, dissect, and incisively analyze them holistically in a manner hitherto not possible. These 5 hypotheses include that: modulating lignin and CCM levels differentially affect carbon assimilation/re-allocation, photosynthesis, and WUE (Team 1); modulating lignin and CCM levels differentially affect secondary and primary metabolite levels (metabolomics) (Team 2); system-wide modification in the transcriptome occurs through a common transcriptional regulatory mechanism, and transcriptome/proteome “discrepancies” result from over-simplification of transcript analyses (Team 3); differential alterations in lignin and CCM levels can often be attributed to overall distinct changes in protein expression and phosphorylation patterns in a defined set of proteins (Team 4); an integrated omics analysis will provide urgently needed new insights into global effects on plant biological processes at both 1g and in microgravity (Teams 1-4). Each hypothesis draws upon the most advanced technologies available for study. We consider that our ICB approach will transform omics analysis through our advanced instrumentation and analytical tools. We will utilize (or design) computational tools/mathematical algorithms for integration and correlation of high resolution phenotype measurements (phenomics) with 'low' resolution global subcellular system measurements (transcriptomics, etc.) through 'nth' dimensional analysis.\nOur study aligns with Research Emphasis 1 and 3, and decadal survey elements in Cell, Microbial, and Molecular Biology (CMM-3, CMM-5), Organismal and Comparative Biology (OCB 2-5), Developmental Biology (DEV-4), and Plant and Microbial Biology, chapter 4 (P2). Our data generation will also be seamlessly integrated with various web-based platforms to handle, disseminate, and inter-actively utilize through iPlant and OpenMSI, and thus are made available to NASA as well as being a community resource.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research will provide NASA and science in general with the first “big ‘omics’ data” analysis, integration, and assessment – at the gene, protein, and metabolic outcome levels – as to how microgravity alters the basic responses of plants when the influence of gravity is removed/minimized. This will serve as the foundation “omics” analyses in subsequent spaceflight and colonization experiments in space, as well as shedding new insights into the manifold effects of gravity during plant growth and development."

            "task_progress": "Overview:\nComprehensive ‘multi-omics’ analyses of model plant species, thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), grown for up to circa 6 weeks duration after germination on International Space Station (ISS) with corresponding Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ground controls. [Multi-omics analyses refer to metabolomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, phenomics, and (to the extent possible) anatomical analysis of lignified stems. A glossary of terms is at end of summary.]\nBiological Partners: Six Arabidopsis genotypes, wild type (WT) Columbia, Columbia modified ostensibly to increase plant biomass, and four lignin-reduced Columbia genotypes. Lignin provides plant cell wall reinforcement, thereby enabling plants to stand upright. Lignin-reduced genotypes, unable to stand upright, were utilized to determine whether structural lignin reinforcement was required in microgravity on ISS. These genotypes offered the exciting opportunity to investigate the central question as to whether there was a threshold lignin level needed for Arabidopsis to stand upright in microgravity.\nConsortium Team Partners: This included research scientists from Washington State University (WSU), University of New Mexico (UNM), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and ISS astronauts.\nObjectives and results:\n1). Establish “multi-omics’ effects of modulating lignin and carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) levels at 1g and in spaceflight on ISS; 2). Compare/contrast data, using an integrated computational biology (ICB) approach, to better define and understand gravity sensing and responses and if threshold/induction parameters are modified or changed when lignin and CCM levels were varied.\nPre-ISS consortium tasks successfully completed 2015-2018 in conjunction with KSC Payload Development Team (PDT):  Generated CCM genotype with small, but measurable, biomass increases and increased stem fiber cell wall thickness, whereas the lignin-reduced adt mutants had weakened vascular bundle cell walls; Established APH Science Carrier Arabidopsis growth conditions for KSC Science Verification Test (SVT), Experiment Verification Test (EVT), and ISS; Demonstrated Arabidopsis seed viability for prolonged storage (24 weeks) in Science Carriers; Identified transportation conditions to ISS for Arabidopsis seeds in Science Carrier, without seeds being dislodged during transit; Scientific/technical evaluation at KSC of suitability of hand-held photosynthesis measurement (FluorPen) device; Quality control criteria established for Arabidopsis tissue sample preparations for multi-omics analyses; Two multi-omics foundational analyses conducted using soil-grown Arabidopsis genotypes, as baseline studies to compare with ISS/KSC investigations.\nSoil-grown Arabidopsis lignin deficient genotypes had reductions in related secondary metabolite levels (flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, glucosinolate, and other metabolite classes). By contrast, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of corresponding biochemical pathway steps generally showed increased abundances, but such responses were ultimately futile in restoring either lignin or secondary metabolite levels.\nISS prototype APH flight unit installation and functional verification: Astronaut Ricky Arnold completed on-orbit Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) installation, with first power-up and 5-day functional checkout on December 01, 2017. Science Carrier with WT Arabidopsis and dwarf wheat seeds in the ISS APH prototype were then successfully flood filled. Plants seemingly looked healthy over a 37-day growth period in Spring 2018.\nISS and KSC Arabidopsis genotype sequential grow-outs: This was the inaugural investigation for the ISS APH prototype, and the project was named PH-01 by NASA personnel. 192 Arabidopsis rosette leaf and stem tissues were collected for multi-omics analyses at circa 6 week growth/development/lignification. Roots were not harvested as APH Science Carrier technical design precluded this.\nPH-01 Grow-out 1: 46 Arabidopsis plants (Day 45) harvested on ISS stored in –160 °C GLACIER freezer until return to Earth (Splashdown, Pacific Ocean, January 13, 2019), with frozen Arabidopsis samples transported and delivered to Institute of Biological Chemistry (IBC), Washington State University (WSU). Samples were immediately stored at –80 °C at WSU until needed. KSC Ground Control Arabidopsis tissues (from 46 plants) were transported/delivered in frozen form to IBC/WSU and stored as above.\nPH-01 Grow-out 2: PH-01 Grow-out 2 was highlighted in NASA’s first 8K video (1.2 M views to date since its release 5 years ago;\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/8k-science).\n43 similarly frozen plants, following harvesting on Day 45, were returned to Earth January 7, 2020, then transported/delivered frozen to IBC/WSU and stored as above. KSC Ground Control Arabidopsis tissues (from 40 plants) were also transported/delivered in frozen form to IBC/WSU and stored as above.\nAPH plant health, plant genotype validation, and APH functional performance assessments: Overhead and side camera images were used daily to assess plant health and growth, and stem orientations, during ISS and KSC Grow-outs. Plant growth was estimated by measuring rosette leaf areas, where it was concluded that ISS-grown plants lagged in growth/development relative to KSC counterparts. PAM photosynthesis measurements showed higher variability on ISS, relative to KSC, presumably reflecting higher stresses experienced on ISS. Both ISS and KSC grown Arabidopsis genotypes, nevertheless, all looked robust and healthy visually.   Stems of ISS lignin-reduced mutants were, however, unable to stand upright, and subsequently discovered have to abnormal stem vasculature cross-sections when compared to KSC grown specimens – all consistent with a higher lignin level threshold being needed to grow upright, even in microgravity. This was an unexpected finding, and opposite to conventional wisdom.\nArabidopsis tissues, for multi-omics analyses, had genotypes validated on return to Earth. Of the 192 specimens evaluated by PCR, 4 rosette leaf samples did not have the genotypes as assigned to their designated APH Science Carrier position number, and these were accordingly amended.\nISS and KSC ICB multi-omics analyses: The comprehensive analyses and ‘big data’ compilation represented a significant spaceflight (ISS) multi-omics ICB baseline study for Arabidopsis. However, meaningful integration of multi-omics data is a well-known problematic issue across all biology disciplines. Accordingly, our inter-disciplinary team effort focused upon integration and analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics (including initial emphasis on secondary and primary metabolites, lipids, and lignin). Our approach was designed to tease out key ISS spaceflight environment effects relative to KSC counterparts.\nICB metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics analyses: ISS lignin levels were generally lower than KSC Ground Controls and resulting from slower plant growth on ISS. Secondary metabolite (stem and rosette leaf) profiles for both ISS and KSC Grow-outs had similar profiles, with flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, glucosinolate, and shikimate-chorismate pathway levels generally becoming (increasingly) lower in lignin-deficient genotypes. The mainly primary metabolite analyses of stems established shikimic acid and phenylpropanoid levels on average also decreased in genotypes most lignin-deficient, relative to WT, for both stem/rosette leaf tissues in ISS/KSC Grow-outs 1 and 2. Aromatic amino acids, Phe and Tyr, in stems showed similar trends whereas in rosette leaves results were more varied for the same genotypes.  In contrast, bona fide biochemical steps for the above secondary metabolite pathways generally showed increased proteome and transcriptome abundances in lignin-deficient genotypes, but these were again futile in restoring either lignin or secondary metabolite WT genotype levels, whether ISS or KSC grown.\nTowards determining ICB transcriptomic and proteomic effects on photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and photorespiration: Our ICB approach also targeted photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and oxidative phosphorylation to evaluate whether photosynthesis and photorespiration were affected. Transcription profiles from Grow-out 2 (with transcripts from chloroplast and mitochondrial encoding proteins retained) indicated that Photosystems I and II subunits were down-regulated in a lignin-reduced genotype (ISS vs KSC), as were two rate-limiting Calvin cycle enzymes.  Our preliminary analysis of global transcript levels clearly revealed a dramatic shift in transcriptome machinery and Calvin cycle proteins, but it remains to be determined whether one or more mechanisms are responsible for the varied genotype responses to differing lignin contents. Proteomic analyses were apparently similar, together with indications that photorespiration had increased in lignin-deficient genotypes.\nTowards better understanding ICB transcriptomic and proteomic effects for radiation and DNA repair on ISS-grown Arabidopsis genotypes: Numerous genes associated with base/nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination were statistically differentially expressed (DE) in the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment. The largest lignin-deficient mutants had more DE, suggesting different genotype responses to increased radiation in the ISS spaceflight environment. Proteins related to radiation damage repair in ISS Grow-out 1 also increased in abundance, as compared to KSC counterparts. DNA repair and recombination proteins, DNA replication, and homologous recombination proteins were additionally affected. This observation may suggest that plants with reduced lignin levels were more prone to DNA damage in the ISS spaceflight environment.\nTowards determining ICB single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects on ISS grown Arabidopsis genotypes: Our transcription analysis unexpectedly suggest that mutation rates might be lower in ISS vs KSC samples. This was unexpected given the ISS spaceflight environment (including radiation and microgravity) experienced. A provisional hypothesis for these results includes possibility of over-expression of DNA repair mechanisms resulting from exposure to the ISS spaceflight environment. This would be consistent with the observed differential regulation of DNA repair mechanisms observed. Such over-expression could cause more mutations to be corrected, as compared to the baseline rate of mutations observed with KSC samples. Alternatively, ISS plants were possibly more stressed due to microgravity and increased radiation, thereby (at least in part) causing slower organismal growth rates. Slower growth rates would correspond to slower and fewer cell divisions, which could conceivably reduce the number of observed mutations across all cells in each tissue sample.\nTowards correlating ICB proteomic and transcriptomic ISS spaceflight responses as regards cell signaling and microbial perception/susceptibility for ISS Arabidopsis genotypes: Initial analysis of differential expression observed in ISS (as compared to KSC) samples revealed more differential regulation in leaf compared to stem tissues. This trend was present in both transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, albeit to a lesser extent with protein abundance differences. Functional Term enrichment analysis showed photosynthesis-related proteins significantly down-regulated in leaf samples on ISS compared to KSC, this being consistent with previous studies of plant responses to stress conditions.   Up-regulation at the transcript level for leaf samples on ISS was concentrated in signaling, and related genes, as well as genes involved in systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Various proteins related to cell signaling followed the same trend and increased in abundance in Arabidopsis plants with least lignin contents. For stem samples on ISS, no GO terms were significantly enriched among protein sets, but for transcriptomic features, down-regulation of growth and development and up-regulation of defense responses and signaling highlighted the list of regulatory differences. Several disease resistant proteins, and precursors to a hypersensitive response (HR), were significantly upregulated, perhaps suggesting attempted acclimation to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment.  Exosome and membrane trafficking proteins are often involved in protection against pathogenic attack. As lignification also plays a role in plant-pathogen/microbial defenses, it may be that ISS grown plants with reduced lignin levels are more prone to increased pathogen susceptibility in the spaceflight ISS microgravity environment.\nTowards completion of IBC multi-omics analyses and visualization: Significant progress was made in integrating/comparing the diverse multi-omics datasets to gain both new and comprehensive insights into the systems-level response(s) to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment with the six Arabidopsis genotypes. Metabolomics data was used as a cross-check.  Pathway analysis used targeted and untargeted approaches. The former involved extracting features from each dataset associated with various structural (biochemical) pathways and comparing fold changes in ISS vs KSC across genotypes. The latter involved use of a LANL developed tool OPaver (Omics Pathway Viewer). Opaver enabled us to map differential expression/abundance values onto curated KEGG pathway maps for multi-omics datasets. Our analysis to date indicates that some metabolic pathways were augmented by the ISS spaceflight environment conditions vs KSC, but analysis is still ongoing.\nOutreach:\nOutreach was an important component of this ISS/KSC study, but with no direct support from the NASA supported project here. The Outreach components are summarized further below.\nSummary and future steps: An important and continuing contribution was in providing the best possible multi-omics integration analyses for the various Arabidopsis genotypes grown on ISS and at KSC. Our massive datasets and other documentation, although embargoed until publication, are currently being provided to NASA Gene Lab for curation, as well as to data repositories required for publication. It is anticipated that our multi-omics integration will continue to take an additional 12 months or so to fully complete – including giving additional attention to effects of radiation on ISS and potentially different effects on the various Arabidopsis genotypes.   Ongoing analyses include determining the full extent of physiological modulations induced in the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment, by: 1) more detailed mapping of transcripts to specific intra-cellular compartments (i.e. chloroplast, mitochondria, etc.) in order to more fully understand how microgravity on ISS modulates various metabolic pathways; 2) deducing what trends may be uniquely attributed to the ISS spaceflight microgravity environment; 3) further addressing the proposal hypotheses that system-wide modifications noted in ADT KO and WT Arabidopsis genotypes may be caused (in part) through a common transcriptional regulatory mechanism.\nGlossary: Metabolomics here included analyses and quantification of secondary metabolites (many with plant defense functions), lipids (largely fatty, waxy, or oily compounds), primary metabolites (considered essential for plant growth and development), and lignin. Transcriptomics and proteomics were used for detection of gene expression and corresponding protein/enzyme profiles (and their individual abundances) at the circa 6 week harvesting stage for both ISS and KSC Grow-outs. Phenomics included photosynthesis measurements using a hand-held pulse-amplitude monitoring (PAM) device, used for the first time on ISS, as well as in monitoring of rosette leaf tissue areas and of ‘bolting’ stem orientations during Arabidopsis growth/development/lignification. Cell wall anatomical analyses of both ISS and KSC Arabidopsis stems were used to determine whether ISS grown Arabidopsis stem vasculature differed from corresponding KSC Ground Controls.\nUnexpected setbacks: Germination and plant death/dying difficulties were experienced in both ISS Grow-outs. This required analysis of ISS APH functionality data records, as such difficulties did not occur during KSC Grow-outs. It was concluded that there was uneven APH watering in growing all needed plant genotypes and, in particular, for ISS Grow-out 1, as well as intermittent ISS APH partial lighting failures for Grow-out 2. Furthermore, analysis of water availability at different growth positions in the APH on ISS was a complication that can hopefully be better teased out from further analyses of multi-omics and ISS APH data for both Grow-outs. In both cases, together with slower growth on ISS, only one 6 week harvest was possible for multi-omics analyses.\nSupplementary (Publications to Date, Newsletters, Seminars/Lectures, Presentations, Significant Media Coverage, Training, and Outreach)\nPublications:\nHöhner, R., Marques, J.V., Ito, T., Amakura, Y., Budgeon, A.D., Jr., Weitz, K., Hixson, K.K., Davin, L.B., Kirchhoff, H., and Lewis, N.G.  2018.

He carried out/refined Arabidopsis growth conditions using the Science Carrier that was to be fitted into the APH. The Washington State Space Grant Consortium kindly provided supplementary support for both high school and undergraduate participation. Mr. Pezeshki successfully completed his Senior Project, and which led to several successful outcomes. He gave two posters (one at WSU for the University Showcase, and a second one in October 2017 in Seattle at the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) in a session for High School students nationwide). He was also supported by a travel grant from ASGSR to present his work.  Some of Mr. Pezeshki’s activities included:\n•\tSieving, washing, and autoclaving of Turface arcillite particles used as the growing substrate for plants on board ISS, as well as preparation of foam and gauze templates to support the seeds and plants in the final assembly of the Science Carrier unit.\n•\tRecording and editing videos to present to NASA KSC personnel, so that they could review our plant harvesting and processing methods used for RNA, protein, and metabolite extraction. These videos were instrumental for assessing constraints involved in foil pack dimensions required for plant samples for adequate preservation during storage and for rapid processing upon return to Earth. This was helpful for developing procedures necessary for optimizing astronaut crew time spent on harvesting and critical storage of samples in the limited freezer container space aboard ISS.\n•\tAssistance with transgenic plant sample preparation for PCR gene screening analysis. This involved DNA extraction from freshly harvested plant leaves, and use of these samples as DNA templates for the PCR mixtures. Samples were amplified using a thermocycler instrument and then run on an agarose gel for a qualitative analysis assessment.\n•\tDeveloping protocols for harvesting and processing different parts of Arabidopsis plants which included separating leaves, stems, siliques, flowers, etc., and then later on grinding tissues and preparing extracts suitable for our multi-omics studies. He continuously assisted in preparing plant tissue samples for metabolomic analysis. He also prepared a video presentation on this that was also very helpful for the NASA scientists/astronauts by recording this entire process beginning from harvest to extraction.\n•\tStudying effects of humidity on metabolite levels at different harvest times. Mr. Pezeshki individually processed leaf and stem tissues of four and six weeks old Arabidopsis wild type plants grown under low and high humidity conditions. He studied the growth and development (stem length and weight) of Arabidopsis wild type plants harvested at different time intervals. He also successfully completed this experiment without assistance. After he had expertise in preparing tissue samples suitable for metabolomics, he was assigned to study the metabolomics of NASA-SVT (Science verification test) samples.\nPhD students Kim K. Hixson, Qingyan Meng and Jorgen Tacetta: Both K.K. Hixson and Q. Meng completed their PhD degrees (N. G. Lewis, Advisor) in the Molecular Plant Sciences program, Washington State University.

            "task_description": "As NASA pursues its goal of sending human colonies to Mars and beyond, there is a pressing need to better understand how the spaceflight environment influences fundamental biological processes. Understanding how plants respond to gravity on Earth and the microgravity environment in space is of particular interest because of the important role that plants will play in advanced bioregenerative life support systems during long duration space missions. In recent years, numerous transcriptomic datasets have shown that hundreds of genes change expression when plants are grown in space. However, it has been challenging to tease apart which genes change due to microgravity from those that change as a result of general plant stress responses. This difficulty stems from the fact that plant spaceflight genomics datasets have been derived almost exclusively from whole seedlings and plant organs, which could potentially mask or dilute gene expression changes that are occurring within the distinct cell-types that are responsible for gravity sensing (e.g., root columella and stem endodermal cells). Thus, the major goal of this NASA-ground-based proposal is to begin to take steps to develop methodology that will enable space genomic studies on homogenous cell populations. Here, we propose to use laser capture microdissection (LCM) to conduct RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) on gravity sensing columella cells to identify gene regulatory networks that govern early responses of plants to gravity. We hypothesize that gene profile signatures from a homogenous population of columella cells will more clearly reflect transcriptomic changes that are directly linked to microgravity. The RNA-Seq data that we obtain from our analysis of root columella cells will be compared to columella-specific gene modules we identified through our Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) of Arabidopsis seedlings grown for 6 and 11 days on the International Space Station (ISS) (specific aim 2). In parallel, we will refine LCM methods with the goal of implementing them for future plant spaceflight genomics (specific aim 1). The latter aim will involve ground-based experiments in which specific steps in the LCM methods will be modified to mirror in-orbit operations.\nUpon successful completion of this proposal, we expect to generate new tools for conducting genomics in homogenous plant cell populations that will enable us to better differentiate microgravity effects from microgravity independent effects.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research seeks to fill technological gaps that will enable a better understanding of how plants develop in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. The focus of this research is to develop methods that will allow us to learn more about how expression of genes within specific root cell types change under microgravity or stress-induced spaceflight. The plant organ of interest in this proposal is the root. Because roots are crucial for uptake of water and nutrients to support optimal plant growth, results from this proposal will benefit agriculture on Earth. We expect that genes, which show cell-type expression changes in response to gravity could be potential targets for pre-breeding efforts toward developing crop cultivars that are resilient to environmental stress imposed by marginal lands on Earth and confined growth environments during spaceflight."

            "task_progress": "SPECIFIC RESEARCH AIMS\nAim 1: Refine and develop laser capture dissection (LCM) methodology in plant roots for potential implementation in future spaceflight studies.\nAim 2: Characterize differential gene expression within gravity sensing columella cells during root gravitropism.\nAim 3: Characterize the function of candidate gene(s) that demonstrated differential expression in maize root cells during gravity stimulation.\nAim 4: Perform a parallel study of maize orthologous gene(s) with likely function in gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana.\nRESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS\nThis grant is a continuation of NASA grant 80NSSC19K0129, which was transferred from the Noble Research Institute to the University of Wisconsin in May 2022 (UW; current grant 80NSSC22K0024). Research accomplishments at the Noble Research Institute and since the grant transfer to the University of Wisconsin are outlined below.\nSpecific Aims 1 & 2: Refine and develop laser capture microdissection (LCM) methodology in plant roots for potential implementation in future spaceflight studies and utilize this approach to characterize differential gene expression within gravity sensing columella cells during root gravitropism.\nRoot caps consist of longitudinally arranged cells which include the meristem, columella, and lateral root cap cells. The columella cells contain amyloplasts that act as statoliths for gravity perception in the roots (Ijima et al., 2008). Root caps can be collected non-destructively by manually dissecting them with a scalpel. Using this approach proved to be an easier and much more high throughput alternative to LCM, making it compatible with isolating sufficient samples enriched for gravity sensing cells in the root cap to use for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)-based transcriptomic analyses. Maize roots are relatively large, with root caps harvestable by cutting ~3 mm of the tip of the root. This approach yielded samples suitable for extraction of high-quality RNA that was used for bulk RNA-Seq to analyze for genes that were differentially expressed in the root tip when plants were gravi-stimulated by rotating by 90 degrees, versus plants maintained vertically. Analysis of the transcriptome response confirmed that the gravistimulation led to different gene expression patterns with a distinct separation of vertical control and gravity simulated data points. These gravity-related changes were also seen to change over time.\nRoot tip cells displayed the most transcriptional changes at 30 minutes post gravity stimulation, with 47 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A second peak in DEGs was seen at 2 hours, with 29 differentially expressed genes. The DEGs at the peak in transcriptional reprogramming at 30 min were analyzed for their functional groupings by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and were related to metabolism, cell cycle, energy, and the cell wall. The lack of detectable changes in transcription at 5- and 10-minutes post gravistimulation may indicate the lag between events related to gravity perception and transcriptional activation. Nonetheless, studies have shown that the gravity signal is transduced by root cap cells within 15 minutes of gravity stimulation as they exhibit dynamic changes in signaling elements, such as Ca2+ (Plieth and Trewavas, 2002) and microtubule dynamics (Blancaflor and Hassenstein, 1997). Indeed, lines expressing the GCaMP Green Fluorescent Protein-based Ca2+ sensor in a root tissue specific manner, including the gravity sensing cells of the root cap, have been generated as part of this work to allow confirmation of these rapid signaling events (Krogman et al., 2020).\nThe observation that rapid signaling occurs within this 15 min timeframe where no significant transcriptional response was observed may indicate that the root cells preferentially utilize a rapid, non-transcriptional signaling pathway for these earlier, perception-related time points. The large number of DEGs at 30 min would then reflect a wave of transcriptional response to these early signaling events. The lack of DEGs at 1 hour post gravity stimulation may represent a resetting point of earlier gravity signal perception to allow for a shift from perception-linked events to the regulation differential growth observed at 2 hours. The gene ontologies at this 2 hour timepoint were cell cycle, transcription, metabolism, energy, and the cytoskeleton.\nSince 30 mins and 2 hours exhibited the most DEGs, these timepoints were the focus of analysis using two linear modeling packages for analyzing RNA-Seq data, DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) and limma-voom (Law et al., 2014) implemented in the iDEP 2.0 software (Ge et al., 2018). Gene candidates were further filtered based on gene annotations in maize and available orthologue information in Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), alongside the availability of knockout mutants in both species. This approach yielded 7 high priority candidates for further study.\nSpecific Aims 3 & 4: Characterize the function of candidate gene(s) that demonstrated differential expression in maize root cap cells during gravity stimulation and perform a parallel study of maize orthologous gene(s) with likely function in gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana.\nIt was possible to isolate homozygous maize mutants in 3 of the 7 candidate genes identified from aims 1 and 2: TIR2, NPI270, and OSCA5. These mutants were then phenotyped for root gravitropic response in comparison to their wild-type parent (the maize W22 inbred line). The TIR2 mutant showed a significant reduction in gravitropic root bending between 1 and 2.5 hours after the root was rotated by 90°.\nOrthologous genes to the maize genes outlined above were also identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and homozygous knockout mutant lines isolated for gravitropism assay. The A. thaliana orthologs of maize TIR2 are the AUXIN F-BOX (AFB) 2 and 3 genes. These belong to the family of TIR1/AFB auxin receptors that localize in the root (Prigge et al., 2020). Genetic lesions of AFB2 and AFB3 in single and double mutants also resulted in reduced root gravitropic response, similar to the lowered gravitropic response seen in tir2.\nAs AFBs are intimately linked to auxin response, these Arabidopsis knockout mutants were crossed with plants expressing the fluorescent auxin reporter DII-Venus. Analysis of DII-Venus signal then allowed analysis of whether reduced gravitropic response is likely due to changes in auxin response, in particular altered auxin asymmetry between the upper and lower flank of the root. This bioreporter is targeted to the nucleus where it fluoresces. However, as auxin levels rise, the reporter is degraded. Analysis of the wild-type DII-Venus response showed that, upon reorienting the root to the horizontal, the expected asymmetry in reporter developed over a 3 h timeframe, with the lower side of the root showing reduced signal, i.e., reflecting the predicted increased auxin levels on the lower side of the root that are known to drive gravitropic growth. However, the development of this asymmetry appeared to be lost between 1 and 2 hours in afb2-3 and afb3-5 mutants. This observation suggests that the lesion in gravitropic response in afb2 and afb3 lines might be linked to a feedback regulation of these AFBs on the auxin transport and redistribution required for differential growth during root bending.\nIN SUMMARY, the major findings from this research have been: (1) transcriptomic changes elicited by gravity stimulation of the maize root occur in 2 phases. Phase 1 occurs at ~30 min after initial perception events and phase 2 occurs after ~2 h and is likely related to the modulation of cell growth. There is a time between these 2 phases when gravistimulation-triggered gene expression falls to zero, possibly reflecting a transcriptional reprogramming away from perception events towards gravitropic growth control. (2) TIR2/AFB2/AFB3 are involved as regulators of root gravitropic growth. (3) AFB2/AFB3 may be operating by modulating the auxin redistribution that is triggered by gravity stimulation, likely in a feedback loop on auxin production or transport.\nREFERENCES CITED\nBarker R, Gilroy S (2017) Life in space isn’t easy, even if you are green.

            "task_progress": "Status  Pick-and-eat Salad-crop Productivity, Nutritional Value, and Acceptability to Supplement the International Space Station (ISS) Food System (VEG-04A, VEG-04B, and VEG-05) is a set of hybrid experiments of plant research with human organoleptic and behavioral research. These experiments are sponsored by the Human Research Program but are implemented in partnership with the Space Biology Program.  The VEG-04 flight experiments were conducted in 2019, and the VEG-05 experiment was conducted on ISS Dec. 2022 through March 2023. Because of the delay, an additional component was added to this experiment, known as HRF VEG (which stands for Human Research Facility – Veggie). The HRF VEG experiment consists of collecting data-of-opportunity from other space biology investigations with plants that were conducted on the ISS between the VEG-04 and VEG-05 tests. Data collected are specific to the human research foci of this project and include only behavioral health and performance data with the Veggie Questionnaire and Profile of Mood States data collected and Organoleptic acceptability data on the crops.     I.\tUpdates   A.\tStudent Augmentation of Grant  A student augmentation grant titled “Pick-and-Eat Salad-Crop Nutrition & Next-Generation System Designs” was awarded by the Human Research Program to PhD student Jess Bunchek associated with this larger project. This augmentation enabled nutritional analysis of crop samples grown in the EDEN ISS plant production facility at the German Neumayer Station III in Antarctica and the aeroponic nutrient solutions with which the crops were grown. These data will provide a better understanding of crop nutrient composition across different plant production platforms and across a long-duration expedition in an isolated, confined, extreme environment that has similarities to a space mission. With this augmentation, Jess was able to attend the HRP Investigators Workshop and present “Nutrition of Antarctic-Grown Crops to Supplement the Crew Diet, with Applications for Spaceflight.” A manuscript highlighting this experimentation is expected in FY24.\nB.\tVEG-04A and B  VEG-04A was conducted during Increment 57-58 and ran from June 4, 2019-July 9, 2019.  VEG-04B was conducted during Increment 61-62 and ran from October 1, 2019-November 28, 2019, and both had ground controls run ~48 hours later.  Science samples were returned from the ISS and were processed for microbiological food safety and chemical analyses.\nAn article, Pick-and-eat space crop production flight testing on the International Space Station, was published in Feb. 2024 in a special edition of The Journal of Plant Interactions, Article Collection on “Plant Astrobiology.” The citation is:\nJess M.

Data are being compiled for publication as part of the BHP data set for this study.\nD.\tVEG-05  Experiment Summary  The Veggie (Vegetable Production System) on the ISS offers an opportunity to develop a “pick-and-eat” fresh vegetable component for the ISS food system as the first step towards bioregenerative supplemental food production.  In the Veggie unit, during spaceflight, salad plants will be grown, focusing on the impact of light quality and fertilizer formulation on crop morphology, edible biomass yield, microbial food safety, organoleptic acceptability, nutritional content, and behavioral health benefits of the fresh produce for the Solanum lycopersicum \"Red Robin\" dwarf Tomato cultivar. The VEG-05 experiment will test different red-to-blue light ratios using the Veggie units on the ISS. Tomato plants will be grown in Veggie for ~100 days and astronaut crewmembers will provide plant care and pollination, and harvest fruit 3 times during and at the end of this growth period. Crewmembers will be asked to complete self-report surveys, including the Profile of Mood States – Short Form (POMS-SF) and a Veggie-specific questionnaire pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. They will also be asked to perform an organoleptic evaluation of a portion of the fresh produce they consume at harvest.\nConsumed tomato samples will have their mass measured on ISS prior to crew consumption, and half of the produce will be frozen and returned to Earth for post-flight microbiological food safety and nutritional analysis. The goal of this experiment is to help define light colors and horticultural best practices to achieve high yields of safe, nutritious appealing tomato fruit to supplement a space diet of prepackaged food.\nVEG-05 Flight Operations  SpX-CRS-26 launched the VEG-05 payload on Nov. 26, 2022, and it docked on Nov. 27. Initiation of VEG-05 was started on 12/9/2022, but challenges led to subsequent initiation activities on 12/12/2022 and plant growth initiation on 12/14/2022, with the first ground control started 12/16/2022. This was later terminated due to poor germination and a second ground control was run 2/1/2023-05/12/2023. Both flight and ground control ran 100 days, with harvests of fruit at day 83, day 90, and day 100. In total, from the five surviving red-rich lighted plants in flight, only 5 ripe fruits were produced, and from the four surviving blue-rich lighted flight plants, 10 fruits were produced with only 6 of these ripe by day 100. A large number of photos and some video tours are part of the plant data collected. Due to the challenges with growth enumerated in the previous report, all planned activities were not accomplished. Human subject surveys were conducted but there were insufficient fruit samples for sensory evaluation. All fruit and plant samples were returned frozen at or below -80ºC. Plant samples included leaves and adventitious roots of surviving plants. Water samples were returned from root mat reservoirs, with the post-growth samples collected the day after harvest. Only a few swabs were taken from the flight Veggies from bungees only, due to harvest activities running over time. The planned samples from bellows and the Veggie fans were not collected. Pillows 1, 3, 7, and 10 were also collected and returned for analysis of roots, wicks, and substrates.\nBecause of the small sample sizes and factors affecting growth on the ISS, the objectives of assessing the light quality effect (red: blue light treatments) will not be fully achieved. Revised objectives of this study include comparing stressed flight plants with normal ground plants to determine the impact of plant overwatering stress in space on food safety and the plant microbial community, to determine nutrient content changes in fruit and leaves from stressed plants, and to evaluate stress metabolism changes in returned tissue by transcriptomic analysis. Postflight analysis was conducted with the following analyses being prioritized: A. culturable microbiology and food safety as well as molecular microbial community analysis of 1. ripe fruit; 2. leaves, stems, and adventitious roots; 3. pillow components (roots, wicks, and substrates); 4. swabs; and 5. water samples from root mats before and after growth. B. transcriptomics of leaf tissue and adventitious roots, and C. elemental analysis of leaf tissue.  Unfortunately, there was insufficient tissue to conduct the analyses of leaves; however, elemental analyses were performed on a few of the harvested fruit.\nMicrobial Analyses  Total Culturable Microorganisms were assessed with determinations of Aerobic Plate Counts (APC)/Bacteria and Total Yeast and Mold Count.  Specific pathogens were screened for including Generic E. coli/Coliforms using Petrifilm, Salmonella sp. using enrichment/selective media, and Staphylococcus aureus using Petrifilm. Any colonies that grew in these methods were isolated and identified using the Biolog MicroID system and MicroSEQ fungal and bacterial gene sequencing ID. Screening for selected pathogens yielded negative results and this was confirmed by community 16S and ITS sequencing.\nWe observed no difference between red-rich and blue-rich treatments in bacterial and fungal CFUs in-flight samples. The red-rich ground control surface swabs and adventitious roots had significantly lower bacterial counts than the blue-rich treatment, while the fungal counts were lower in the red-rich wicks, leaves, and adventitious roots. Blue-rich fruit samples, surface swabs and leaves were lower in the ground controls than in the flight samples for both bacteria and fungi.\nMolecular Analyses - Microbiome  Community sequencing was performed using the 16S rRNA gene for bacterial taxonomic identification with the QIIME 2.0 with Silva approach. ITS was used for fungal taxonomic identification using KRAKEN2 with the UNITE database.\nIf we look at a heat map of the total microbiome, we see differences between flight and ground, and we see that true roots (from plant pillows) and adventitious roots had higher community diversity than leaf or fruit samples. When we look at 16S details by sample we see Pseudomonas dominating many of the samples, and if we remove that we start to see different clustering appear.\nMolecular Analyses - Transcriptome  Transcriptomics of leaf and adventitious roots sampled was performed with the GeneLab RNA-Seq Consensus Pipeline-RCP. We looked at the percentage distribution of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in adventitious roots and leaves of ground and flight plants grown with either the red-rich or blue-rich lighting treatments and saw that leaf and root tissue in blue-rich lighting showed a higher percent of DEGs.\nWhen Principal Component Analyses (PCA) are performed on these data, we start to see leaf and root DEGs clustered based upon condition (flight versus ground) and gene expression completely separated based on tissue type, but there is overlap in both tissue types between flight and ground. If PCA plots are coded to differentially represent red-rich and blue-rich treatments, there is considerable overlap between ground and flight samples in red-rich treatments, but blue-rich samples segregate between these locations.\nWork is underway to interpret the differential gene expression observed in VEG-05. In leaves, there is strong differential regulation of genes in blue-rich grown samples in flight. Biological processes are identified, such as light-harvesting photosystem I, cell division, and protein regulation. There is a different group of upregulated genes in blue-rich grown ground control leaf samples with functions such as cell cycle regulation and protein biosynthesis being modified. In adventitious roots, we see some similar responses as in the leaf tissue including changes in photosynthesis, ATP energy production, and protein biosynthesis. This is not unexpected because the adventitious roots did contain some chlorophyll.\nIn the red-rich grown plant samples, there were fewer DEGs. For leaves, these involve respiration, mitochondria and energy production in the form of electron transport. In adventitious roots, DEGs are showing that these are responding to red-light differential regulation in photosynthesis and energy production, protein biosynthesis. When gene ontology is looked at, we start to see a broad categorization of the genes involved. For adventitious roots under the same conditions, we see similar responses to the leaves but also responses to stress, hydrogen peroxides catabolic processes or redox stress.\nOverall, there appear to be more DEGs in leaf and adventitious root samples in blue-rich light compared to red-rich light. A functional enrichment analysis of DEGs showed similarities between leaf and adventitious root samples, as expected. Some of the hallmarks of spaceflight were detected in flight samples including stress response, lignin, radiation stress, and hydrogen peroxide catabolic processes. Further analyses are underway, and two manuscripts on the VEG-05 plant data are being prepared. While not generating the desired information on spaceflight growth responses of healthy crops, our team is hopeful that these analyses will shed light on tomato responses to stress in this environment as plant overwatering stress is a mission-relevant condition that could occur in future space crop growth systems.\nBehavioral Health data from VEG-04, HRF VEG, and VEG-05  Plants as a Potential Spaceflight Behavioral Health and Performance (BHP) Countermeasure  Plants are a potential countermeasure for the stresses of living in space. Caring for plants and eating fresh food have been shown to serve as a psychological benefit for previous astronauts and for others in analogous environments such as Antarctica (Schlacht et al., 2019, Vessel & Russo, 2015). Gardening can be therapeutic and has been used as such in terrestrial settings (Odeh & Guy, 2017). These effects may carry over or even be more pronounced in austere resource-limited environments such as spaceflight. It can reduce stress and increase sensory stimulation and enjoyment (Vessel & Russo, 2015). Growing crops for consumption may also offer astronauts a form of meaningful and engaging work as they care for living things in an austere environment away from Earth’s nature and as they provide sustenance for their crew. Additionally, fresh produce may enhance the diet and encourage consistent consumption by avoiding menu fatigue, which may further support psychological health and well-being by supporting a healthy brain and body (Douglas et al., 2022). Despite these potential benefits, difficulty in crop production and struggling or dying plants may reduce positive effects. The data on the psychological effects of growing crops in spaceflight is limited.\nAs such, we examined behavioral outcomes associated with tending to plants and consuming crops grown during long-duration missions. Here, we further characterized which aspects of horticulture are most salient and psychologically beneficial to astronaut health and well-being. We hypothesized that engaging with plants during a mission would have a beneficial effect as evidenced by reported positive mood and enhanced well-being, meaningfulness, connection to Earth, relationships, and performance. We also hypothesized that interacting with the plants would be a source of positive sensory stimulation for the crew. Preliminary in-flight data analysis results are described below. More comprehensive analyses are underway in preparation for the final report.\nMethods for the In-flight Phase for BHP Aims  Participants  Participants were 27 astronauts who interacted with the plant systems VEG-04, VEG-05, and HRF-VEG (Human Research Facility – Veggie). HRF-VEG data were collected from other space biology investigations of plants that were being conducted on the ISS between the VEG-04 and VEG-05 tests. HRF-VEG data included VEG-03 I, J, K, and L and PH-04. Total N sizes noted below vary by different plant activities, depending on what each astronaut may or may not have experienced during their mission. There was a total of 106 in-flight observations.     Measures  POMS-SF. The Profile of Mood States Short Form (Curran et al., 1995) was given to participants every three weeks around plant growth. Results forthcoming.  BHP Veggie Questionnaire. The Behavioral Health and Performance Veggie Questionnaire was given to participants monthly, beginning with plant growth initiation. Plant and crop growth experience items examined enjoyment and time spent performing specific activities with the plants; behavioral health outcomes such as engagement, demanding, meaningful, and effects on well-being, mood, performance, and relationships with others; connections to the Earth; desire to work with and eat plants; sensory stimulation for sight, smell, touch, and taste; human factor aspects of time, training, and supplies; and experiences with struggling or dying plants. Items were initially offered on a 201 or 101-point visual analog scale (VAS), with higher ends of the scale indicating more positive outcomes, e.g., enhanced enjoyment, meaning, and engagement. The lower ends of the scale were anchored with more negative outcomes, e.g., diminished enjoyment, etc. The scale midpoints were neutral in that they neither enhanced nor diminished. Data was binned to a 7-point Likert scale at the direction of the study’s biostatistician for use in our analyses. Participants selected a specific survey version based on whether they interacted with the plant system(s) or not, and we included only the scores from the crewmembers who participated in any given activity.\nPreliminary Results and Discussion for BHP Aims  Generally, engaging in tasks related to the plants and crop growth (a.k.a., Veggie tasks), was enjoyable. The highest ratings were related to consuming the harvested plants and voluntary viewing, suggesting that some crewmembers found time to experience the plants and nature as a source of enjoyment. Tending to the plants was also moderately enjoyable (e.g., plant thinning, pollinating, wick opening, and harvesting), indicating that there are BHP benefits from this work task.\nThe BHP impacts of whether the task was engaging, meaningful, supported well-being, or was demanding for a crewmember also indicates generally positive trends. Engaging, meaningful, and supporting well-being were strongly, and positively correlated with each other, which is consistent with behavioral health and workplace research that suggests that engaging and meaningful work can support well-being. Scores for these three positively-oriented variables increase over time, suggesting that the benefits of working with plants – that is, seeing them grow, tending to them, continuing to enjoy them as nature, and ultimately, consuming the fresh produce – becomes a greater source of behavioral health benefits as the long-duration mission continues.\nFor plant activities, not only are they generally enjoyable for those crewmembers engaging with the plants, but the data show voluntary viewing, watering, harvesting, and consuming as consistently, positively related to the task being engaging and meaningful, and enhancing well-being. Preliminary analyses suggest that working with plants in space as well as consuming them, can be a behavioral health countermeasure for long-duration spaceflight. Additional analyses will be completed for the final report and a publication is in the works.\nReferences  Curran, S. L., Andrykowski, M. A., & Studts, J. L. (1995).

            "task_description": "Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:\n(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.\n(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.\nThe BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants."

            "task_progress": "The flight component of this project is awaiting the availability of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware and an associated flight opportunity. Fresh seed stocks have been maintained and validated for all the genotypes for the experiment and are regularly being tested for germination and growth characteristics to be ready for a potential flight opportunity.\nWork has continued to characterize how spaceflight conditions such as hypoxic stress might be influencing plant defense capabilities. Flooding stress and hypoxia are thought to be important elements of the plant spaceflight environment due to the loss of both gravity-driven water flow and buoyancy-driven convection in the microgravity of space. On Earth, flooding stress is thought to lead to shifts in defense capabilities against pathogens, priming the plant to defend itself more effectively once the flooding stress has subsided. Additionally, flooding is thought to suppress responses to herbivory and mechanical damage. Previous spaceflight data from the Advanced Plant Experiments-05 (APEX-05) experiment have been analyzed and combined with ground-based studies. Previous work has shown that when the CAX2 vacuolar Ca2+ transporter is knocked out, plants become resistant to flooding stress on Earth. These same CAX2 knockouts were grown on the International Space Station (the APEX-05 flight experiment). Analysis of patterns of gene expression from the APEX-05 data indicated that the wild type plants exhibited molecular signatures of hypoxia and oxidative stress while growing in space. These changes were coupled to alterations in patterns of gene expression associated with response to both pathogen-attack and physical damage, or herbivory effects that were not seen in the cax2 mutant. Ground-based experiments showed that a hypoxic stress of ~6% oxygen can mimic many of these spaceflight-related events.\nAn additional major effect of spaceflight on the cax2 mutant was a large-scale shift in patterns of gene expression towards those related to cell wall biogenesis, maintenance, and remodeling in the shoot. Glycome profiling was therefore used to catalog cell wall polymer composition. Glycomics uses a suite of monoclonal antibodies to quantify the non-cellulosic cell wall polymer composition through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay. This profiling revealed spaceflight-triggered increases in wall polymers such as xyloglucans and pectins in both wild type and the cax2 mutant. However, a notable difference between the two genotypes was that, in wild type, spaceflight induced upregulation of the xylan components of the wall in only roots; whereas in the cax2 mutant, this change was shifted to being exclusively in the shoot tissues. The xylan content of the wall plays a key role in both structural support and in maintaining a resilient physical barrier for plant defense, indicating a likely major shift in these features is being elicited by growth in space. These results further suggest that the regulatory networks governing these changes to the wall are strongly influenced by the action of the CAX2 gene, potentially through its role in Ca2+-based signaling of hypoxic stress.",

            "task_description": "To prepare for future human exploration missions far from Earth, NASA’s Space Biology Program is seeking to build a better understanding of the effects of spaceflight and zero gravity on the biology of microorganisms, plants, and animals in spacecraft, the International Space Station (ISS), and also in ground-based analog experiments. The National Research Council recommended that NASA undergo studies to elucidate the effects of short and long duration spaceflight on the biology of all three categories of organisms. Technological advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS), spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics (spatial omics), several of which we describe below, create an unprecedented opportunity for in-depth molecular studies applicable to the purposes of NASA’s Space Biology Program. This provides scientists, engineers, and clinicians a more comprehensive view of the functional dynamics of organisms as they evolve and respond to unique or highly selective environments including the ISS.\nSpaceflight causes changes in cell signaling pathways that are better understood only by increasing the analysis resolution level. In this project, we will deploy new technologies, i.e. spatial transcriptomics, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, multi-omic spatial mapping (human and microbial), and systems biology algorithms to discover new insights relevant to the impact of spaceflight on human health. These data and methods will shed light on the complex biosystem dynamics that spaceflight causes in humans. We will be able to clearly dissect the gene expression changes occurring at the single-cell level, analyze how these changes affect the cell-cell genetic and physical interactions, and begin the first-ever in vivo human-microbial interaction maps from spaceflight. To do so we will conduct rigorous and cutting-edge omics analysis using two complementary platforms (10x Genomics Visium and Nanostring’s GeoMx) with six main rodent organs collected throughout several past spaceflight missions and their corresponding ground controls. Our integrated biology approach will allow us to understand physiological, anatomic, and molecular mechanisms of adaptation and response in animals to spaceflight.\nFor our organism-wide study we will leverage the extensive amount of samples collected throughout several Rodent Research (RR) missions which are accessible through the Life Sciences Data Repository (LSDA). Several of these specimens have already been allocated for Dr. Mason through LSDA. Our study will represent the first-of-its-kind in space biology and will provide foundational discoveries that will allow us to understand not only how astronaut conditions can be improved during spaceflight, but also how the changes induced by spaceflight can be translated into modern medicine to improve human health on Earth. Moreover, we will apply several statistical and machine learning techniques in order to predict changes induced by spaceflight at the organism level for future long-term missions.",

In total, three eyes from the Live Animal Return (LAR) spaceflight group, three eyes from the LAR ground control group, three eyes from the ISS-T spaceflight group, and three eyes from the ISS-T ground control group are in the sequencing queue.\nAs an example, one flight eye and one ground control eye was processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform in addition to the flight eye from the last progress report. We also processed the RNA for each tissue.

Tomato plants will be grown on orbit in the NASA Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on board the International Space Station (ISS) with and without the beneficial rhizosphere microbe Trichoderma hazianum. A third sample will be of this microbe growing under identical conditions on the ISS but without the plants. These samples will be compared to parallel ground controls at 1 x gravity as well as to samples growing on 1-axis and 3D clinostats. Assays will integrate RNAseq-based transcripomics and ionomics (nutrient uptake and distribution) alongside biochemical measures of photosynthesis and stress. These comparisons will provide measures of both how spaceflight affects the plant, the microbe, and the relationship between these organisms and additionally, how well microgravity analogs can reproduce these kinds of events on the ground. In addition, the omics-level data gathered from this study will be compared to the wealth of spaceflight-related omics data available through the GeneLab data repository. Using an approach of orthologous matrix mapping will allow identification of similar genes between diverse species and so allow for comparisons of, for example, the degree of similarity between patterns of gene expression to be compared between different species. Overall this research will help define how spaceflight may modulate plant, microbial, and plant-microbe responses and help understand whether defined beneficial microbes may provide a countermeasure to the deleterious effects of spaceflight on plants. The work will capitalize on the complementary expertise of two groups: the Gilroy lab team (plant spaceflight, transcriptomics) and the Hanson lab (biochemistry, photosynthesis).",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This proposed research seeks to address how spaceflight modulates the interactions between plants and microbes using tomatoes and the beneficial soil microbe Trichoderma harzianum. The microbiome around the plant root is recognized as a crucial element in the productivity and hardiness of plants but the complex interactions and chemical signals that occur between plant and microbe have only recently begun to be dissected. Yet, for example, T. harzianum is used as a commercial biostimulant, being added to the soil to pormote plant growth and vigor. The research in this project will further define the molecular components of the interaction between plant root and this fungus and how spaceflight alters these events. Thus, the work will not only provide insight into how plant-microbe interactions are affected by spaceflight but address whether T. harzianum might be used as a biostimulant to counteract some of the stresses of spaceflight on plant growth. This research will also help provide molecular insight into how these interactions occur on Earth. Such a fuller understanding of plant-microbe interactions, especially of T. harzianum-plant root communications and response will be important steps towards optimizing these beneficial interactions and so increasing plant productivity in both space and on Earth."

            "task_progress": "FLIGHT EXPERIMENT:\nThe experiment (Advanced Plant Experiment 10) was launched on the NG-20 Cygnus spacecraft. All in orbit operations were successfully completed in the Veggie hardware on the International Space Station and all the biology samples were returned to Earth on the CREW 7 vehicle. [Ed. Note: The NASA Vegetable Production System (Veggie) is a plant growth unit on the International Space Station (ISS). It is capable of producing salad-type crops to provide the crew with a safe, palatable, and nutritious source of food, while also providing a tool to support recreation and relaxation.] The biological samples consisted of sterile Petri plates containing nutrient gel medium with either tomato seeds alone, tomato seeds inoculated with spores of T. harzianum, or Petri plates inoculated with fungal spores alone. A 2 mm pore size polyester mesh that was bounded by a 3 mm wide, 0.5 mm thick, 3d printed PETG perimeter rim was incorporated onto the top of the nutrient gel before planting of the seeds or inoculating with fungal spores to facilitate crew harvesting of plants and fungal colonies at the end of the experiment. Plants were grown under continuous light for 14 days in the Veggie hardware, with crew photography every other day. The experiment also included gas sampling of the air around the Veggies to allow stable carbon isotope analysis for calculation of photosynthetic and physiological parameters such as plant water use efficiency. On day 14, plates were opened in the Life Sciences Glovebox on the ISS, to ensure fungal containment, and biological materials were harvested, frozen between aluminum blocks conditioned to -160˚C, and stored in the Minus Eighty (Degrees Celsius) Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) for sample return.\nOn orbit data included imaging of the plants and fungi as they grew and these images reveal that plants showed shorter roots and enhanced lateral root production in spaceflight when compared to ground controls. Treatment with Trichoderma led to reduced primary root growth and increased root system branching with high growth rates of the Trichoderma. Cabin air was also sampled for comparison to an analysis of stable carbon isotope ratios of the biological materials and analysis indicates that the 13C:12C isotopic ratio is suppressed in spaceflight although carbon to nitrogen content is unchanged.\nBiochemical analysis of the samples has included measurement of chlorophyll and carotenoids as indicators of photosynthetic pigment content, quantification of the stress pigment anthocyanin and measurement of the levels of malondialdehyde, a biochemical reporter of oxidative stress. These analyses have revealed that although spaceflight did not alter photosynthetic pigment accumulation, it did lead to a shoot-level signature of stress (significant anthocyanin and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation).\nFurther analysis for these samples includes transcriptomic analysis via RNAseq and glycomic profiling of the cell wall materials. Glycomics involves extracting cell walls and then using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against known wall epitopes to quantify wall polymer abundance using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)-based assay. Glycomic profiling has now been optimized for use with these spaceflight-related samples across multiple plant species.\nCURRENT WORK:\nCurrent work is focused on completing the full glycomic profile from the Advanced Plant Experiment 10 (APEX 10) spaceflight samples and a set of parallel clinostat grown tomato samples, along with ionomic profiling. Ionomics quantifies trace element composition of 15 minerals within the plant using Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectroscopy.\nPRESENTATIONS AND OUTREACH:\nThese spaceflight-related projects continue to form a key part of the laboratory’s outreach efforts. They have been presented at venues ranging from the meeting of the International Space Life Science working Group in Liverpool, UK, to the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, to the Plant Cell Dynamics meeting, to the Midwest sectional meeting of the American Society of Plant Biologists. This research has also formed the core of outreach to the general public at events including the University of Wisconsin’s Science Expeditions and the ‘Space Camp’ offered to 5th-8th graders at the Deke Slayton Space Museum in Sparta, Wisconsin. Interviews about the flight portion of this grant have been presented to media such as Wisconsin Public Radio, WORT radio, The Midwest Farm Report, Spectrum News and local new outlets and magazines such as the Wisconsin State Journal.",

            "task_description": "Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:\n(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.\n(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.\nThe BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants."

            "task_progress": "The flight component of this project is awaiting the availability of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware and an associated flight opportunity. Fresh seed stocks have been maintained and validated for all the genotypes for the experiment and are regularly being tested for germination and growth characteristics to be ready for a potential flight opportunity.\nWork has continued to characterize how spaceflight conditions such as hypoxic stress might be influencing plant defense capabilities. Flooding stress and hypoxia are thought to be important elements of the plant spaceflight environment due to the loss of both gravity-driven water flow and buoyancy-driven convection in the microgravity of space. On Earth, flooding stress is thought to lead to shifts in defense capabilities against pathogens, priming the plant to defend itself more effectively once the flooding stress has subsided. Additionally, flooding is thought to suppress responses to herbivory and mechanical damage. Previous spaceflight data from the Advanced Plant Experiments-05 (APEX-05) experiment have been analyzed and combined with ground-based studies. Previous work has shown that when the CAX2 vacuolar Ca2+ transporter is knocked out, plants become resistant to flooding stress on Earth. These same CAX2 knockouts were grown on the International Space Station (the APEX-05 flight experiment). Analysis of patterns of gene expression from the APEX-05 data indicated that the wild type plants exhibited molecular signatures of hypoxia and oxidative stress while growing in space. These changes were coupled to alterations in patterns of gene expression associated with response to both pathogen-attack and physical damage, or herbivory effects that were not seen in the cax2 mutant. Ground-based experiments showed that a hypoxic stress of ~6% oxygen can mimic many of these spaceflight-related events.\nAn additional major effect of spaceflight on the cax2 mutant was a large-scale shift in patterns of gene expression towards those related to cell wall biogenesis, maintenance, and remodeling in the shoot. Glycome profiling was therefore used to catalog cell wall polymer composition. Glycomics uses a suite of monoclonal antibodies to quantify the non-cellulosic cell wall polymer composition through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay. This profiling revealed spaceflight-triggered increases in wall polymers such as xyloglucans and pectins in both wild type and the cax2 mutant. However, a notable difference between the two genotypes was that, in wild type, spaceflight induced upregulation of the xylan components of the wall in only roots; whereas in the cax2 mutant, this change was shifted to being exclusively in the shoot tissues. The xylan content of the wall plays a key role in both structural support and in maintaining a resilient physical barrier for plant defense, indicating a likely major shift in these features is being elicited by growth in space. These results further suggest that the regulatory networks governing these changes to the wall are strongly influenced by the action of the CAX2 gene, potentially through its role in Ca2+-based signaling of hypoxic stress.",

A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.\nThe objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.\nTogether, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures.",

            "task_progress": "The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. Our research goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX CRS-12 (SpaceX-12) at the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in August 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/- 4 hours of splashdown, ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were sacrificed after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight. The flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to the control groups. Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed changes in biomarker expressions related to BRB integrity. Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.\nExtended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/-4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.\nAstronauts returning from spaceflight have experienced eye problems, which may decrease retinal performance and lead to long-term effects on visual acuity. This study leverages the collected data from spaceflown murine retinas that were treated with redox-active metalloporphyrin (BuOE) to mitigate spaceflight-induced changes and respective ground controls. 10-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown on SpaceX-24 (RR-18) to the ISS national lab, kept in low Earth orbit for 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. Our multi-omics analysis of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data generated from subsequent murine retina tissues uncovered genes, pathways, and epigenetic modifications consistent with the therapeutic potential of BuOE. From RNA-Seq analysis of spaceflown murine samples, the treatment group shows differentially expressed genes relative to saline controls that reached significance, and genes that are related to protection against cell oxidative damage and cellular response to organonitrogen compounds. Ranked fold-changes from the same contrast were used for gene set enrichment analysis, which showed biological processes reaching significance, including glutathione metabolic processes and cellular response to xenobiotic stimulus. The findings from this investigation have the potential to provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying conditions like Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) and assess the effectiveness of BuOE as a countermeasure for astronauts experiencing neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities, which can lead to long-term effects on visual acuity.\nThe physical demands of deep-space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, understanding this has the potential to guide strategies to mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight, or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected for DSP: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis 1 (CA), and Dentate Gyrus (DG). Because spaceflight is associated with increased oxidative stress, treatment with antioxidants has emerged as a potential strategy to attenuate the effects of spaceflight. We therefore treated a subset of the spaceflight and control mice with the superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), and performed DSP on them as well. Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) due to spaceflight in all four regions of frontal cortex, cortex, CA1, and DG, with CA having the highest number of DEGs. Each brain region showed a distinct transcriptomic response, while some DEGs were common to two or more regions. A pathway analysis revealed distinct pathways sensitive to oxidative stress, as well as metabolic pathways, to be enriched in each of the brain regions. These represent the first spatial gene expression profiles taken of rodents in space, and may help improve our understanding of brain region-specific susceptibility to spaceflight conditions.  Treatment with BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of DEGs, suggesting that BuOE may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage.\nThe goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1g on the acute and late intraocular pressure (IOP) changes and function of the retina. To determine the extent to which an antioxidant protects against spaceflight environment-induced changes in the retina, the mice were administered weekly superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE) or saline treatments, before launch and during their stay aboard the ISS. Forty ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on SpaceX-24 over 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before launch, IOP was measured using a handheld tonometer, and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG).  ERG data was recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to a weak, diffuse, full-field flash of light. Within 20 hours after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before sacrifice. Subsets of mice will be measured after 6 months of the spaceflight for the re-adaptation study. There were significant increases in body weight for both habitat control and vivarium control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements (p<0.05). However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown.  The IOP measurements were similar between pre-and post-flight groups. There were no significant differences between BuOE-treated mice and saline controls. To assess the retinal function, we measured the amplitude of the scotopic ERG b-wave, which is primarily generated by ON-type bipolar cells.  Bipolar cells are the main neurons of the retina that carry signals from photoreceptors to ganglion cells.  These data indicate, for the first time, spaceflight conditions may induce bipolar cell damage and dysfunction.\nIt has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel, digital color-coded barcode counting technology was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from the flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response was significantly downregulated. Here, we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on neuronal function.",

            "task_description": "Plants exhibit differential growth in response to a change in their spatial orientation relative to the gravity vector. To date, the signaling processes linking the perception of a gravistimulus to the initiation of a differential growth response are poorly understood.  Using the pulvinus of cereal grasses  as a model system, we have shown that both rapid and long term increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) correlate positively with the gravitropic bending response of both oat and maize stems (Perera et al., 1999, Proc Nat Acad Sci 96:5838-5843; Perera et al., 2001, Plant Physiol 125:1499-1507).  Our previous work has revealed that  InsP3 is a major player in the signal transduction cascade mediating the gravitropic response and suggests that the PI pathway is an important target for regulating cellular responses to gravity.      \tOur hypothesis is that the long term increase in InsP3 is essential for differential growth.  We propose to take a reverse genetic approach to affect the long term differential increase in InsP3 and alter PI metabolism.\n1.\tAbolish the differential increase of InsP3 by expression of  a human  type I inositol polyphosphate 5 phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) that specifically hydrolyzes InsP3.  We predict that the graviresponse of these transgenic plants will be attenuated.\n2.\tIncrease synthesis of  PtdInsP2 by up regulating  PtdInsP 5-kinase expression (the rate limiting enzyme in PtdInsP2 biosynthesis in plants). We anticipate that the gravisensitivity of these transgenic plants will be enhanced.\nBy altering InsP3 and PI metabolism and thereby affecting differential growth we will add to the basic understanding of the role of the PI pathway in plant gravitropism as well as the mechanisms by which cells  perceive and respond to a change in orientation.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "A major contribution of this work will be a clearer understanding of the role of  the PI pathway and InsP3 in plant gravitropic responses as well as insight into the mechanisms by which cells perceive and respond to a change in orientation.\nA second, important contribution will be the transgenic plants produced.  These plants which should have low levels of  InsP3, will enable other scientists to quickly identify a putative role for IP3 in their stimulus of interest.  In addition to providing a rapid method for screening for PI pathway involvement, the InsP 5-ptase and PtdInsP 5-kinase transgenic plants will allow scientists to investigate cross-talk between InsP3 and other signaling pathways.\nA final contribution will be towards the future design of stress tolerant transgenic plants.  We anticipate that the InsP 5-ptase overexpressing plants will have reduced sensitivity to environmental stresses, which could have a major impact on the survivability and  productivity of plants under unfavorable conditions including space flight and non-terrestrial environments."

            "task_progress": "1. We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the gravitropic responses of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing InsP 5ptase.  At least 3-4 independent transgenic lines have been characterized with respect to the gravitropic bending response of roots, hypocotyls and inflorescence stems.  We have found that gravitropic response is reduced by ~ 30 % compared with wild type in roots, shoots and inflorescence stems of the transgenic plants.  In collaboration with Dr. Gloria Muday of Wake Forest Univ, we have examined the root bending response using the ADAPT system. We have determined that the major difference in the root response between the wild type and transgenic plants appears to be in the rate of curvature after initiation of bending thereby resulting in the reduced response.\n2. We have also completed the InsP3 analysis during a time course of bending in inflorescence stems.  With gravistimulation, InsP3 levels increase in the wild type stems with a peak ~ 5 min and again between 15-20 min.  These increases in InsP3 precede visible bending and therefore are in good agreement with our previous work on cereal stem pulvini.  InsP3 levels in the transgenic stems appear to fluctuate and increase as well; however the overall levels are drastically reduced compared with the wild type (~ 5% of wild type values).\n3. We have further characterized the drought tolerance phenotype exhibited by the transgenic plants.  Our major findings are that the transgenic plants lose less water from their leaves compared with the wild type. Guard cells of transgenic plants respond similarly as wild type to light and dark treatments. However, transgenic guard cells are more responsive to ABA, which may partly explain the lowered water loss.  In addition, induction of ABA-responsive genes is enhanced in transgenic leaves compared with wild type.",

            "task_description": "In all vertebrates, the otolith system functions to detect head position and movement relative to gravity and to modulate or control gravity depending neuromotor responses. How does gravity influence the development of the otolith receptor cells, their polairzation topography, and their innervating afferents during embryogenesis?  The avian otolith system offers an excellent model with which to study the effects of gravity upon development, due to the short maturation period following fertilization and due to the broad existing knowledge of otolith system structure and function in birds.  The present project is  examining the effects of gravity upon the structure of the avian otolith receptor system.  Japanese quails, due to their short incubation time of 15 days are being exposed to different levels of gravity during embryogenesis and their vestibular receptor systems examined using a number of  different quantitative anatomical measures. Quail raised from fertilization in either normal gravity, hypergravity (2 - 3G), or microgravity (spaceflight) conditions will be compared.  The anatomical development of the receptor cell organization and the afferent innervation patterns throughout embryogenesis and early post-hatch development are being collected for comparison across the different gravity conditions and developmental stages.  The primary goal is to define whether gravity is a determinant trophic factor in development of the otolith system during embryogenesis.  In order for manned long duration missions to succeed, the effects of altered gravity environments upon nervous system structure and function must be determined.\nThe primary objective of the present proposal is to determine the effects of gravity upon development of the peripheral vestibular system.  It is known that even moderate exposure to spaceflight conditions in adult animals can produce modifications in the anatomy, physiology, and neuromotor responses related to the vestibular system.  In addition, more limited evidence shows that altered gravity environments can directly affect the development of vestibular receptors.  Within the vestibular system, the otolith organs comprise the inertial sensors that respond to linear acceleration or tilts of the head relative to gravity.  During spaceflight or centrifugation, the acceleration constant due to normal Earth gravity is eliminated or changed, thereby altering the inertial reference upon which vestibular system responses are based.  Does gravity serve as a regulatory factor in the development of the vestibular system and its proper neuromotor function?  This project serves as a ground-based investigation that will examine vestibular receptor organ development in quails completely reared in either Earth normal or altered hypergravity environments.  The current application will build upon the isolated findings of our recent spaceflight investigation on STS-108, where embryogenesis in microgravity was found to affect vestibular otoconia, afferent innervation, and synapse formation in quails raised to embryonic day 12.  Current experiments are designed to specifically examine how otoconial biosynthesis, receptor morphology, afferent innervation, and synaptogenesis are affected by exposure to constant hypergravity conditions during embryogenesis and early post-hatch development in Japanese quails.\nObjective 1.  Determine how altered gravity affects the morphology and molecular biosynthesis of otoconia in birds.  Otoconia are dense biomineral particles in the otolith organs that serve as mechanical inertial transducers for the detection of linear acceleration and subsequent receptor cell activation.  It is known that in invertebrates and fish, development of the homologous statolith is highly sensitive to altered gravity conditions.  We hypothesize that the regulation of otoconial biosynthesis is affected by gravity.  In Objective 1, the otoconial morphology and the molecular parameters of otoconial biosynthesis during quail embryogenesis and early post-hatch development will be examined using both normal gravity and hypergravity conditions.\nObjective 2.  Determine how gravity affects the development of otolith receptor cells, their afferent innervation, and synaptogenesis.  Two types of receptor cells, three afferent types, and two major forms of hair cell-afferent synapses are known to exist in the otolith sensory epithelium of all amniote vertebrates.  These morphological characteristics develop at different times during embryogenesis and post-hatch maturation.  We hypothesize that the development of receptor cell distribution, afferent innervation, and synaptogenesis in the otolith system is regulated by gravity.  We predict that the rate of maturation, number of cells, number and type of synapses, and afferent terminal innervations will all increase proportionally with the force of gravity.  In Objective 2 we will examine these morphological characteristics at different developmental ages in quails raised in either normal or hypergravity environments.\nIn all vertebrate animals, the vestibular system forms an essential component in the production of movement related responses that are critical for the daily function and survival of the animal.  During manned spaceflight, vestibular disturbances frequently occur, with approximately 80 – 90 % of current flight crew personnel experiencing some symptoms space motion sickness, such as disorientation, nausea, and emetic attacks during the first 48 - 72 hours of weightlessness (Davis et al., 1988; Homick et al., 1984; Reschke et al., 1998; Thorton et al., 1987).  These symptoms can best be described as acute, although they often return after the flight immediately upon reintroduction to the 1g environment.  However, more serious vestibular related effects that occur during long duration spaceflight include changes in compensatory eye movements (Clarke et al., 1993; Clement and Berthoz, 1990; Cohen et al., 1992; Kornilova et al., 1993; Yakovleva et al., 1982), muscle tone and reflex (Edgerton and Roy, 1995; Edgerton et al., 1995), orthostatic intolerance (Yates and Kerman, 1998), and postural stability (Anderson et al., 1986; McDonald et al., 1994; Paloski et al., 1992).  Although a number of investigators have postulated that the lack of gravity as a constant stimulus during spaceflight produces profound changes in vestibular system function, the basic mechanisms that are affected by changes in gravity are only beginning to be addressed.  Several reports have indicated that the structure and function of the vestibular system is affected by exposure to altered gravity conditions.  For example, changes in size of otoconia (Fermin et al., 1996; Ross and Donovan, 1986; Wiederhold et al., 2000), in the receptor-afferent morphology (Ross, 1993; 2000; Gaboyard et al., 2002; Raymond et al., 2000), in hair cell conductance (Chabbert et al., 2003), in vestibular afferent responsiveness (Boyle et al., 2001; Bracchi et al., 1975; Correia et al., 1992; Jones et al., 1993), in vestibular central pathways (Anken et al., 2002; Bruce and Fritzsch, 1997; Kozlovskaya et al., 1984; Pomeiano et al., 2002), and in vestibular related neuromotor responses (Dai et al., 1994; Sebastian, 1996; Takabayashi et al., 1987; von Baumgarten et al., 1975) have all been observed in both adult and developing animals exposed for brief periods in either microgravity or hypergravity.  The current project seeks to determine how gravity affects the morphology of the vestibular otolith receptor system during embryogenesis and post-hatchling development.  Before long duration missions such as a manned presence on the Moon or a Mars flight can be manifested in Spirals 4 and 5, basic knowledge regarding the nature and extent of developmental or adaptational changes in sensorimotor systems that occur as a consequence of exposure to altered gravity conditions must be acquired.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Many sensory systems are known to enter a critical period of development, during which stimulation of modality specific receptors is required for normal neural function.  For example, in the visual system, if deprived of light during the early critical period, normal sight is impaired or eliminated during maturation.  In the vestibular system which controls normal postural, eye and head movement responses during motion, no effort to study the effects of gravity upon development have been extensively performed.  Thus, it is currently unknown whether altered gravity environments affect vestibular system development and subsequent reflex motor behavior.  The current project is examining the trophic influence of gravity upon the development of receptors and their innervating afferent neurons in qauil embryos.  Both hypergravity as induced by chronic centrifugation and microgravity as induced during spaceflight are being used to determine the morphological development of vestibular organs at different stages of development.  The research should provide basic answers into questions related to vestibular receptor pathology that is known to occur with aging humans and in some disease cases."

            "task_progress": "Centrifuge construction:  In order to study the effects of altered gravity environments upon development of vestibular structure and function, we needed to design and build a habitat for hypergravity exposure.  We have developed an 8 foot radius centrifuge capable of housing as many as 6 pregnant female mice at hypergravity and 4 mice in control rotational non-hypergravity conditions.  The habitat features an enclosed chamber with automated feed, water, lighting, and temperature regulation system.  There are 5 video cameras to record behavior, and a computer interface to monitor environmental conditions.  A four chamber control habitat is mounted on the central rotation axis to deliver identical rotational exposure without hypergravity (coriolis force control).  The centrifuge is housed inside a completely closed circular chamber that is temperature regulated and safety-locked for access.  The design and building of the hypergravity exposure unit was involved and detailed.\nConsultation with NASA engineers provided information that reveals that our facility is only one of four in the United States capable of providing chronic hypergravity exposures from fertilization to sexual maturity in small animal species.  The other three are located in NASA facilities.  These are landmark studies and should provide experimental environments capable of answering fundamental questions regarding critical period formation for vestibular system development and beyond.\nMorphology and biosynthesis of otoconia:  Our first project objective was to investigate the biosynthesis of otoconia in quails developed in normal and hypergravity environments.  Using an in-situ probe developed in our laboratory, we found that the major otoconial protein, termed otoconin 90 (OC90) is expressed in quail.  We examined Oc90 mRNA expression from stage E2 through post-hatch day P7 and in adults.  Oc90 was expressed in the thin, nondifferentiated epithelia on the roof of saccule, utricle, and lagena but was absent from the sensory neuroepithelia.  Interestingly, this unique epithelial expression pattern of Oc90 mRNA in the quail is virtually identical to that of mammals.  We observed increasing expression of Oc90 at E2 – E8, with a peak expression of E9, which declined from E9 – E12.  By E13 – P7, no or very little expression was observed.  These findings suggest that otoconial formation occurs as an interaction of secreted OC90 with other local factors in the gelatinous membrane (Wang et al., 1998; Thalmann et al., 2001).  In support of that hypothesis, a novel gene, Otopetrin (Otop1) has been identified as the point mutation source for the naturally occurring mutant tilted (tlt) and mergulhador (mlh) mice that lack otoconia (Hurle et al., 2003).  We have also examined Otop1 mRNA expression in developing quail vestibular organs using an in-situ hybridization probe developed in our lab.   Otop1 was expressed in the otolith receptor epithelium, most likely in the support cells.  Next, we developed quail embryos in a constant hypergravity 2g environment from fertilization.  Quantitative rtPCR was performed using cDNAs for both Oc90 and Otop1 for each developmental day throughout embryogenesis (E2 – E15) and at several post-hatch time points.  Control expression of GapDH was also performed.  We then compared the expression levels of these important otoconial production genes for animals raised in both 1g and 2g conditions, in order to determine if gravity affects the expression of genes that regulate otoconial growth.   Oc90 showed a similar expression profile to Otop1 during development; production of Oc90 reached a maximum at E9 and decreased toward hatching. However, the rate of this regression was lower than Otop1, suggesting that Oc90 may be an active player during growth and maintenance of mature otoconia. Oc90 level was significantly lower in brain than inner ear. Expression of Otop1 was increased at E7 and E10 by hypergravity, but for other time points it did not change significantly.  Similar lack of effect due to hypgergravity exposure was observed for Oc90.  These quantitative results showed that the effect of gravity as an epigenetic determinant of maturation and growth of otoconia is relatively weak.  Accordingly, we also measured otoconial calcium weight throughout development and have not observed any significant difference between animals grown at normal and hypergravity conditions.  We are currently counting the number, size and distribution of otoconial particles as well as measuring the mass of the entire stone sheet to determine if the observed lack of gene expression is consistent with morphological measures.\nMorphology of avian otolith receptors, afferent innervation, and synaptogenesis:  In Objective 2, we hypothesize that the development of vestibular receptor cell distribution, afferent innervation, and synaptogenesis in the otolith organs are dependent upon gravity.  Our first project objective was to investigate the morphology of otoconia in quails developed from fertilization in normal and hypergravity environments.  Japanese quails have a 15 day incubation time.  The otoconia of Japanese quails developed in Earth 1g environments were first examined at each embryonic stage from E4 – E15 using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and sectioned tissue histology.  At developmental stage E4, otoconia were not yet detectable, but at stage E5 immature otoconia were beginning to form in the saccule but not the utricle or lagena.  At E6, otoconia began to form in the utricle and lagena.  Most of the newly developing otoconia in quails were small with double fluted ends.  A quantitative analysis of the number and size of otoconia for animals raised in 1g conditions was performed, with measures taken at each embryonic day and at each of the first four post-hatch weeks.  Otoconia from different regions of the maculae were compared, as it is known that otoconia vary in size depending upon macular location in adults.  We implemented two quantification methods for examining otoconial growth.  The first, provided measurements of the length and width of individual otoconia.  Values for over were obtained from each of 3 standard locations (i.e., lateral striola, central, medial periphery) in each otolith organ, counting only otoconia that lay approximately perpendicular to the visualization plane.  Over 13,000 otoconia were quantified for the utricle and saccule, at the different developmental stages.  For example, at E10 a total of 976 otoconia from 4 utricles were measured; where sizes ranged between 0.9 – 19.7 micrometers in length, 0.8 – 8.2 micrometers  in width, and mean length values (±SD) were 8.0 (±3.6) for striolar, 6.6 (±2.8) for central, and 6.6 (±2.6) for medial peripheral regions.  In adult quails, the otoconia were significantly larger.  Comparable values for 596 otoconia from adult (>6 week) quails were: length ranged between 1.6 – 45.5 µm, width ranged between 1.2 – 19.7 µm, and mean length values of 18.0 (±9.6) µm for striola, 10.2 (±4.8) µm for central, and 9.1 (±3.3) µm for medial peripheral regions.  Mature individual otoconium were characterized by a barrel shape with two trihedral faceted ends.  However, initial formation of otoconia at E5 (saccular) and E6 (utricular) maculae was characterized by a double fluted morphology that consisted of an hourglass shape with extended fins forming trihedral angles of 120º.  Double fluted otoconia rapidly filled, so that by embryonic day 8 mature otoconia dominated the maculae for the remainder of development through adulthood.  Thus, a progression from double fluted to mature forms was noted.  Mature utricular otoconia in adult quails averaged 11µm in length and 5µm in width, with length/width ratios of approximately 2.5:1, for all size ranges.  Saccular otoconia were smaller, having about 70% the size of utricular otoconia in both length and width.  During development, the average size and range of individual otoconia increased nearly linearly for both otolith organs.  In the utricular macula, large otoconia were concentrated in the lateral regions of the epithelium.  In contrast, otoconia of various sizes were distributed uniformly across the surface of the saccular macula.\nWe have also initiated studies to examine the biosynthesis of otoconia during development.  Using an in-situ probe developed in our laboratory, we found that the major protein contained in mammalian and avian otoconia, termed otoconin 90 (OC90) is expressed in quail.  We examined Oc90 mRNA expression from stage E4 through post-hatch day P7.  Oc90 was expressed in the thin, nondifferentiated epithelia on the roof of saccule, utricle, and lagena but was absent from the sensory neuroepithelia.  Interestingly, this unique epithelial expression pattern of Oc90 mRNA in the quail is virtually identical to that of mammals.  We observed strong expression of Oc90 at E4 – E8, with declining expression at E9 – E12.  By E13 – P7, no expression was observed.  These findings suggest that otoconial formation occurs as an interaction of secreted OC90 with other local factors in the gelatinous membrane (Wang et al., 1998; Thalmann et al., 2001).  In support of that hypothesis, a novel gene, Otopetrin (Otop1) has been identified as the point mutation source for the naturally occurring mutant tilted (tlt) and mergulhador (mlh) mice that lack otoconia (Hurle et al., 2003).  In wild type mice, Otop1 mRNA was found using in-situ hybridization to be expressed in the otolith receptor epithelium, most likely in the support cells, and OTOP1 was identified as a protein found in the acellular matrix of the otoconial membrane in the utricle and saccule.  Recently, three separate highly conserved regions of the murine Otop1 cDNA have been identified in expressed sequence tag (EST) clones of chicks, strongly suggesting similar mRNA and protein are also expressed in quails.\nFinally, we conducted an initial study to document the morphological development of the avian otolith vestibular receptor system during embryonic and post-hatch maturation.  We focused on four aspects of development which were crucial to otolith system function including, epithelial growth, hair cell density, hair cell stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation.  We found that despite occasional plateaus, the growth curves for both the utricle and saccule increased in a sigmoidal fashion throughout embryonic development before leveling out after P7.  Hair cell density varied as the embryo developed and was dependent upon macular location.    The complete pattern of hair cell morphological polarization across both maculae in the adult was observed using scanning electron microscopy.  This pattern was first established at E8, the halfway point of embryonic development.  Although other bundle morphologies did exist, the vast majority of immature hair cells first appeared in the sensory epithelia fully polarized with the kinocilia located at the periphery of the stereocilia bundle.  The number of immature hair cells decreased as the embryo developed but new cells were still apparent in the mature otolith maculae.  Using immunohistochemistry and tract tracing techniques, the shape and location of the striolar zones in both otolith endorgans was delineated.  Prior to E10, only type II hair cells populate the maculae and only bouton afferents innervate the epithelium.  At E10, the first few digitiform protocalyces appear that gradually develop into mature calyceal terminals by E12.  At E12, dimorph and calyx afferents are beginning to populate the striolar regions.  Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was examined.  Taken together, these results form a comprehensive picture of the otolith receptors of Japanese quail throughout development.  These studies are now being performed for mice.  We have chosen the JAX labs 128-SJV strain, as they are gentle animals, good breeders, pigmented, and carry no know deficits in hair cell, inner ear, or visual dysfunction.",

In pregnant and lactating mammals, failure to maintain homeostasis exerts pronounced effects on both mothers and their offspring.  Our previous data, derived from pregnant rats exposed to either micro- or hypergravity, support:  1) decreased mammary metabolic activity with increased gravitational force; 2) changes in maternal and neonatal energy balance; 3) altered maternal care; and 4) neonatal mortality.  Further studies were designed to determine if:  1) the lactation defect was caused by changes in energy balance;    2) the lactation defect could be corrected by injections of prolactin or bromocryptine; or 3) whether global gene expression profiles would allow us to develop an alternate mechanism that explains the lactation defect that occurs in hypergravity.         Studies supported by this grant demonstrated that Perturbations in PRL concentration were accompanied by a decrease in PRL receptor (PRLR) mRNA abundance.  It is known that lactogenic hormones, PRL and glucocorticoids, induce PRLR.  However, our recent study showed that PRL was not able to reverse the HG-induced PRLR suppression.  Further experiments were conducted to evaluate whether glucocorticoid supplementation could increase the PRLR in animals exposed to HG.    Secondly, preliminary investigations utilizing across tissue gene enrichment analysis identified derangement in a unique set of genes pivotal to lipid synthesis in HG rats, particularly, in the lactating mammary gland.  We, therefore, extended our investigations to map-out other alterations in transcriptional crosstalk across key metabolic tissues that are induced by exposure to HG during the transition from pregnancy to lactation.",

            "task_description": "Ionizing radiation induces oxidative damage, which affects all cellular components.  However, the most significant form of damage induced by IR, in terms of cell death, mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and effects on the cell cycle, is clustered DNA damage, often resulting in the formation of DNA double strand breaks.  The DNA damage induced by high mass, high energy (HZE) space radiation is though to be more complex than that induced by gamma radiation, as HZE particles generate a denser trail of ionization events in their wake.  We proposed to determine whether the same DNA repair pathways required for resistance to gamma radiation are also required for resistance to HZE particles.  Because of the importance of double strand break (DSB) repair in prevention of carcinogenic “loss of heterozygosity” events, we have focused on DSB repair pathways.  However, we are also interested in signal transduction pathways involved in the detection of IR induced damage- these pathways are important initiators of responses to IR, including cell cycle arrest, induction of repair, and induction of cell death.  Thus we are investigating the effects of mutations in the nonhomologous end joining genes DNA ligase IV (LigIV), and Ku80, the endonuclease XPF, and the damage response genes ATM, ATR, and SOG.  All of these genes are known to affect gamma resistance in mammals, fungi, and plants.  Because knockouts in these genes are lethal in mammals (and, in some cases, in fungi), we are using the plant Arabidopsis as a model system.  We are using the NSRL facility at Brookhaven to compare the sensitivity of these lines to gamma vs. 1GeV Fe particles.\nWe plan to determine which DNA double strand break genes, previously identified as involved in resistance to gamma radiation,  are also required for resistance to HZE radiation.\nThe HZE component of cosmic radiation is recalcitrant to shielding and may result in a significant increase in risk of cancer in individuals undergoing long-term (months to years) exposure.  The identification of genes involved in resistance to cosmic radiation may enable us to determine which individuals are especially susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of HZE and gamma radiation.",

            "task_progress": "Effects of gamma vs HZE on plant growth: We irradiated Arabidopsis seeds of various genotypes and wild-type backgrounds in doses ranging from 25 to 200 Gy.  Approximately 40 seeds were then sown on agar plates and the plates digitally imaged 8 days later.  We used the application NIH Image to trace the roots and enter the length into Excel for statistical analyses.\nIn no case did irradiation prohibit germination- at these doses Arabidopsis embryos do not die. Germination is driven by cell expansion, not cell division, but elongation of the root to lengths greater than approx. 1.5 mm requires cell division.  At the highest doses of Fe ions (200 Gy), cell expansion as well as cell division was inhibited.  Approximately twice this dose of gamma would be required to induce this effect on cell elongation.\nIn order to contrast sensitivity in a quantitative fashion, we interpolated our dose-response curves to estimate the dose required to inhibit root growth at 8 days by 50%. As shown in Table I below, most mutants that are sensitive to gamma radiation are also sensitive to HZE.  In almost all cases, the biological effectiveness of HZE was about 3-fold that of gamma radiation, suggesting the all of the mutations tested play similarly important roles in resistance to the effects of both types of radiation on root growth.  The RBE numbers, however, need additional statistical analysis to determine their significance. The checkpoint genes ATR and ATM differed widely in their effects on resistance to HZE.  Plants defective in ATR were relatively resistant to HZE vs. gamma (RBE = 2.7, rather than 3.7), while ATM knockouts were relatively sensitive (RBE = 4.5).  Correct interpretation of this result would depend on whether growth inhibition in these mutants is due to the prolonged imposition of a checkpoint, or to the failure of a checkpoint and resulting cell death. The LOH data presented below in Figure 2 suggests that the relatively HZE-resistant growth of atr vs. atm may be due to the loss of the ATR-imposed checkpoint, resulting in enhanced loss of heterozygosity in the prematurely dividing cells.\nWe also find that the sog mutation, a defect in a transcription factor required for checkpoint response to gamma radiation in the apical meristem, has little effect on root meristem response to either gamma or HZE.",

In the initial phases of the project, we propose to use the tools of functional genomics in the model plant system of arabidopsis to examine molecular genetic responses that occur during initial and chronic exposure to atmospheres ranging from near earth normal to near Martian pressures and containing various gas mixtures. Based on the results from these analyses, we will identify genes and metabolic pathways that are activated and repressed in response to low-pressure atmospheres, and predict alterations that might enhance the adaptation process. Finally, we will select and directly engineer genetic changes that will test these predictions and potentially lead to plants with enhanced abilities to live in low-pressure environments.\nThe long-term goal of this project is an understanding of the molecular changes in gene activity that accompany the response and adaptation of plants to low atmospheric pressures. Such an understanding will lead to hardware engineering and/or plant genetic engineering modifications that will mitigate the negative impacts of low-pressure atmospheres on plant growth and development, enhance adaptation and strengthen the role of plants as integral and efficient components of extraterrestrial human life support systems.

            "task_progress": "Conclusions.\nArabidopsis plants respond to hypobaria with extensive changes in gene expression patterns.  So even though plants have been known to survive exposure to hypobaria, clearly survival in hypobaric conditions requires a dynamic adaptive response. Some of the altered gene expression patterns are similar to those involved in the hypoxic stress response, as would be expected from the low oxygen partial pressures present in hypobaria; yet some changes in gene expression patterns are unique to hypobaric conditions. These unique differential gene expression patterns demonstrate that hypobaria is not equivalent to hypoxia as an abiotic stress and suggest that, for plants, the response to hypobaria is more complex than the acclimation to the reduced partial pressures of oxygen inherent to low atmospheric pressures. By extension, environmental compensation for hypobaric stress in plants is not as simple as increasing the oxygen content as was done for humans in the low pressure environments of the early space age.\nHypobaria does not equal hypoxia.\nAlthough hypobaria engages pathways distinct from those seen in response to hypoxia, there is significant overlap, indicating that the hypobaria response includes, but is not limited to, a typical response to hypoxia. A relatively small number of genes are induced by both hypobaria and hypoxia , primarily genes involved in fermentative pathways and oxygen transport (Klok et al., 2002). A much larger set of genes is repressed in response both conditions and includes representatives from a wide range of metabolic pathways (see Supporting Information). This wide-spread repression is a well characterized phenomenon of hypoxic stress e.g. (Sachs et al., 1996; Vartapetian and Jackson, 1997; Klok et al., 2002). A much smaller cluster includes genes that were repressed in hypoxic conditions, but were virtually unchanged in hypobaric conditions. The genes representing this group encode several putative proteins that may represent metabolic processes related to oxygen sensing that are mediated through a heme- or iron-based sensor (Quinn et al., 2002). Iron based sensors have been implicated for direct oxygen or indirect redox sensing in various hypoxia-responsive pathways in eukaryotes (Bunn et al., 1998; Zhu and Bunn, 2001; Mecklenburgh et al., 2002), relying in part on subtilisin-catalyzed proteolytic inactivation of p450 that functions in the reduction of Fe(III) in the signal transduction cascade (Aravind and Koonin, 2001). Another small cluster is represented by genes that were induced in hypoxic conditions, and repressed in hypobaric conditions. This group includes additional heme-related proteins, kinases and phosphatases typical of a hypoxic response. The disparity in gene expression patterns displayed in each of these clusters suggests that that hypobaria and hypoxia may differentially activate certain alternative oxygen sensing and transport pathways.\nDesiccation associated pathways are induced by hypobaria.\nCluster A2 defines a large group of genes showing increased expression in hypobaria while being unaffected or repressed in hypoxia, a group largely composed of genes associated with desiccation and ABA signaling related processes (e.g. Ozturk et al., 2002). Examples from cluster A2 include ABI2 (Chak et al., 2000),  the APL3 subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Weber et al., 1995; Rook et al., 2001),  LEAs, (e.g. Siddiqui et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2002) dehydrins and rab-like proteins, (e.g. Mantyla et al., 1995; Nylander et al., 2001; Kizis and Pages, 2002) rd29B and cor15B (e.g. Wilhelm and Thomashow, 1993; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1993), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (Kirch et al., 2001). Thus, it appears that the adaptation response of Arabidopsis to 10 kPa is, at a minimum, a specific adaptation to perceived desiccation which is overlaid upon an adaptation to hypoxia. However, the fact that the plants were grown in a humid environment (>95% rh within the plates), showed no loss of fresh weight or turgor, and yet still responded to 10 kPa as if they were dehydrated, indicates that the desiccation response is likely due to the perception of increased water flux caused by the low pressure environment (Corey et al., 2002) rather than absolute loss of water in the plants.\nArabidopsis plants at 10 kPa presented no wilting, browning or other hallmarks of desiccation. This observation begs the question as to whether successful adaptation to a 10 kPa environment actually requires the activation of desiccation related pathways. It is possible that as long as there is sufficient environmental water available in the growth medium, an induction of desiccation-related metabolism may not be necessary for survival. With regard to bioregenerative life support for space, if the desiccation response is not necessary for adaptation to low pressure, then the induction of these pathways could represent a drain on metabolism with a resultant cost to production. Under this scenario, metabolic engineering designed to divert the inappropriate desiccation response could reduce the drain of these pathways on metabolism. If, however, the desiccation response is required, then enhancing desiccation tolerance may increase production at low pressure. Given the specificity and detail of the 10 kPa response indicated by the present analyses, studies at intermediate and extended low pressures and mutations in the desiccation and ABA response pathways should clarify the role of desiccation responses to low atmospheric pressures. The present data do suggest that the desiccation stress response is tied as much to the flux of water through stomata as to the physical dehydration of tissue.\nConcluding remarks.     The experiments and conclusions discussed here expose the need for continued evaluation of the effects of low pressure on biological systems. In some ways, the gene expression data suggest that we actually have only a small fraction of the data necessary to make informed choices on the gas composition and pressures within vessels that support plant growth. By extension, these data also beg the questions of what sort of undetected responses and adaptations to low pressures occur in other organisms, including humans, and whether low pressure environments have contributed to any of the existing spaceflight data on biology and biological responses in spaceflight environments. So the short term questions involve deepening our understanding of responses and adaptation to low pressures for all organisms and biological systems that may be a part of spaceflight and extraterrestrial habitats. Indeed, unpublished molecular data indicate that even the relatively small pressure drops to 75 kPa that occur in the space shuttle effect the expression of hundreds of genes in Arabidopsis. That being the case, even seemingly small choices about operations and procedures conducted within habitat environments can have measurable and dramatic impacts on the biology of those habitats. Therefore very near term decisions involving, for example, the choices of atmospheric composition and pressure in the Crew Exploration Vehicle will have long term implications for biology. In the longer term, the use of low pressure environments may enable life support systems that otherwise would be impossible to construct or maintain under higher atmospheric pressures, keeping viable the concepts of inflatable greenhouses. For example, transparent greenhouses could be erected on Mars using currently available materials, but only if the internal pressure of the greenhouse could be maintained below 7.5 kPa (Boston, 1981). The rather dramatic changes in gene expression that occur at 10 kPa suggest that response and adaptation to lower pressures will be even more extensive, but the study of such pressures are well within the capacity of current experiment chamber design and molecular expression technology.\nReferences\nAravind L, Koonin EV (2001) The DNA-repair protein AlkB, EGL-9, and leprecan define new families of  2-oxoglutarate- and iron-dependent dioxygenases.

            "task_description": "The main goals of this project are to further document the effects of microgravity on gene expression and polarity development in single spore cells of the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and to test the functional significance of these effects. The spore cells show a characteristic gravity response on earth, which is that gravity directs their developmental polarity. The first microscopic evidence that gravity has fixed the polarity of the cell is that the centrally located nucleus migrates downward, setting up an asymmetric first cell division. Experiments on Shuttle mission STS-93 provided initial documentation of the effects of microgravity on polarity development, nuclear migration, and the pattern of gene expression in fern spores. Results showed that nuclear migration and polarity development both occurred but were randomly directed in microgravity, and that the pattern of gene expression was different in microgravity relative to ground controls for a small percentage of genes. The STS-93 experiments did not have an on-board 1-g control, and a low percentage of the spores were induced to germinate prematurely during handling before launch. Originally, the main goal of this project was to correct both of these deficiencies in a re-flight, and, additionally, to more comprehensively document the effects of microgravity on gene expression, using microarray technology. However following the severe reduction in fllight opportunities after the Columbia tragedy, NASA decided that a flight opportunity for this experiment was unlikely and the main focus of this project was switched to research on two topics tightly linked to the original goal:    1) Production and probing of microarrays of the 5000 cDNAs in the Ceratopteris EST library. 2) Further characterization of the rapid reversal of the trans-cell calcium current in single-celled Ceratopteris spores when these spores are turned upside down. We have made significant progress on both of these topics during the past year and these are detailed in the report below. In addition, a new microchip technology was developed to measure very rapid responses of single cells to microgravity achieved for brief periods during parabolic flight of NASA's DC9 aircraft, and exciting new data were generated with this new technology. Major findings from this project are summarized below under three headings.  This study represents a rare, if not unique, instance in which the results will provide both an extensive analysis of gene expression changes induced by the microgravity environment in single cells and detailed information on the molecular components that are among the most rapidly altered by the gravity stimulus. This kind of gene-level and cell-level information is critical for formulating and clarifying ideas on the most basic biological mechanisms that are affected by the gravity stimulus.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Beside providing new insights into the cellular basis of gravity responses, the data obtained from this project will be more broadly valuable for studies of cell polarity development and of mechanisms of calcium-mediated signaling. This research does not directly seek to understand a disease or malady that affects humans on Earth and/or in space, nor does it seek to develop new therapeutics for alleviating symptoms of a malady on Earth. However, the findings will help to understand the growth of plants better, and since plants are a crucial source of food for humans, this research does seek to understand the malady of malnutrition. Also, this research does yield a new understanding of basic biological processes, specifically the processes of plant growth and the cellular mechanisms whereby gravity can affect the developmental polarity in cells. Further, this research points to a real role of gravity in regulating growth and development of plants on Earth and thus reveals potential problems in achieving normal growth and development of plants in space. Finally, the health of humans is inextricably linked to the ability to control and continuously improve the growth of plants. This, in turn, requires an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control growth in plants. The accomplishments of this research contribute to that improved understanding, and thus indirectly benefit humans."

            "task_progress": "The major advances we made on this project are summarized below under three headings.\n1. Major Gene Expression Changes Occur While Gravity Is Directing the Polarity of Fern Spore Development\nDNA Microarray technology has provided a method of monitoring expression profiles of almost any biological system during developmental changes under a variety of different conditions. We chose to use the microarray approach to get a global assessment of gene expression changes that are induced by the microgravity environment of the Shuttle mid-deck during flight in outer space. We mastered several technical hurdles to produce uniform microarrays of 3,207 genes (cDNAs) taken from an Expresed Sequence Tag library that had been made from RNA isolated from single spore cells of Ceratopteris 20 h after their germination was induced by light. We tested the reproducibility of the system and to get a rigorous assessment of the gene expression changes that occur developmentally at 1-g during the first 48 h of the germination process, we carried out a study of the expression changes that occur during this period, which includes the time during which gravity determines the polarity of spore development. For this analysis, we used thoroughly replicated microarray data analyzed by a Bayesian model for determining statistically significant changes. We gathered data from 34 array hybridizations, which included at least 8 replications of 4 different developmental time point comparisons. Analysis of these data revealed over 900 genes with relative changes in transcript abundance over the first 48 hours of spore development. Within the first 24 hours about 1% of genes on the microarray were differentially expressed at least 2.5 fold. We also used real time quantitative RT-PCR to independently verify the expression changes observed in microarray analysis.\nAfter the analyses described above we obtained another 1200 ESTs to raise the total in our library to nearly 5000. Analysis revealed that in this library about 3930 unique genes were represented. In order to determine the EST library’s percent coverage of the actual population of genes expressed during spore germination, we estimated the number of unique genes present in the population by applying an approach used to estimate species richness in ecological studies.  According to this estimate there are about 14,250 unique genes expressed 20 h after light initiation of spore germination, suggesting that the current 3930 unique genes represent approximately 27% of those sequences.\nThe identity of the genes designated as unique was determined by BLAST analysis against the Arabidopsis proteome, yielding 2710 (ca. 70%) with significant homology (E-value = 1.0 × 10-10) to Arabidopsis proteins.  Using the Gene Ontology terms of the matching Arabidopsis loci, functional and localization assignments were made for each of these Ceratopteris genes. The functional patterns seen in Ceratopteris spores were generally similar to those found in the Arabidopsis tissues sampled.\nA poster report on this work by the main hands-on investigator, Mari Salmi, won first prize for best graduate presentation, plant category, at the annual meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology in November 2003. Later, this work was published in Plant Physiology (Salmi et al., 2005).\nBecause the quantitative assays of transcript abundance measured in this work were internally consistent and reproducible, we could be confident to proceed to a global comparison of gene expression patterns at 1-g vs. micro-g, To do this we used RNA extracted from spores flown on STS-93 in a high-throughput evaluation of gene expression changes induced by space flight in a single cell, the germinating spore of Ceratopteris richardii, which exhibits both perception and response to gravity. cDNA microarray and qRT-PCR analysis of spores germinating in microgravity onboard NASA space shuttle flight STS-93 revealed changes in the mRNA expression of roughly 5% of genes analyzed. These gene expression changes showed some interesting similarities to those that occur during gravity perception and response in animal cells and multicellular plants. These findings contributed to a more thorough understanding of the impact of gravity on cellular growth and development, and provided insights into the adaptive strategies of individual cells in response to this force. A manuscript on this work has been submitted to Planta and is currently under review.\n2. Molecular Components of the Gravity-Directed Calcium Current in Ceratopteris: Characterization of a Membrane-Bound Calcium Pump\nDuring the period in which gravity determines their developmental polarity, germinating spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii exhibit a bottom-to-top calcium current. This current is capable of rapid reorientation, reversing direction in less than 42 sec when the spores are turned upside down. The current is parallel to the subsequent axis of cell development and blocking the current with nifedipine disrupts the ability of gravity to direct the polarity of spore development. The entry of calcium into the bottom of the cell is presumably mediated by a channel-type transporter and its exit from the top of the cell by an ATP-dependent pump. The function of the channel(s) and pump(s) that drive the current must be rapidly modulated by gravity and understanding how gravity does this will require identifying these transporters and characterizing the mechanisms that control their function. Toward this end, we identified three cDNAs from a Ceratopteris EST library whose sequences predict that they encode Ca2+ATPase pumps. Two of them encode proteins that are most similar to calcium pumps known to be plasma membrane localized. The expression of one of these (CrACA1) appears relatively unchanged during the period when the gravity-directed current is strongest, i.e., the first 16 hours after germination is initiated by light, as judged both by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR assays.  We raised antibodies to a 93-mer peptide corresponding to the large loop between transmembrane regions 4 and 5 of CrACA1, and demonstrated their specificity in immunoblot analyses. These investigations were important first steps in the identification of the pump(s) that drive the gravity-directed calcium current, and in the discovery of the mechanisms by which gravity controls pump function.\nA poster report on this work by the main hands-on investigator, Thomas Bushart, won first prize for best graduate presentation, plant category, and the annual meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology in November 2004. It was published in Dr. Bushart's 2007 Ph.D. dissertation (University of Texas), and is included in a manuscript now being prepared for submission to a top journal.\n3. Development of a A MEMS Fabricated Cell Electrophysiology Laboratory Biochip for In-silico Ca2+ Measurements, and Use of this Chip to Document that Changes in Gravity Rapidly Alter the Magnitude and Direction of a Ca2+ Current Across Fern Spores\nThe first experiments to measure a gravity-directed calcium flux in Ceratopteris spore cells used a self-referencing ion-selective electrode system that sequentially measured the directional flux of calcium at various points around the spore (4, 5, 6). Although these experiments showed that the direction of the current inverted when the cells were rotated 180o, they did not reveal how quickly the current changed direction, so interpretation of whether gravity was directly or indirectly altering the activity of the transporters that drove the current was not possible.\nWe upgraded the electrode system with computer controlled stepper motors to rotate individual spores and measured calcium fluxes at two of the three positions around the spore (bottom, top, and side) before and after 180 degree rotation of the spore, and confirmed that the gravity-directed reversed in less than a minute after the cell was inverted. Then, in collaboration with Marshall Porterfield (Purdue University), we also devised a microfluidic device that could measure the calcium current across 16 cells simultaneously and continuously in real time, and this permitted both an assay of gravity-directed changes in the calcium current in real time during spore rotation and an assessment of whether changes in the force of gravity altered the magnitude of the current. The design, fabrication, and testing of this microchip (referred to as a cell electrophysiology lab-on-a-chip (CEL-C)), and the interface instrumentation and software for measuring differential calcium concentrations were published in two separate reports (ul Haque et al., 2006; ul Haque et al., 2007).\nUsing the microfluidic device, we demonstrated that the direction of this polar calcium flux is reversed in less than 30 sec when the cells are inverted, and the magnitude of the flux rises and falls rapidly in parallel with the rapidly changing g-forces during parabolic flight on the NASA DC9 aircraft. We found that the current was suppressed by either nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) or eosin yellow (calcium pump inhibitor), but only nifedipine disrupts the ability of gravity to direct cell polarity. Spores were verified to be expressing the gene and protein for a plasma membrane-type calcium pump. Our results indicated that gravity perception may be mediated by a mechanically activated ion channel in this plant cell, an idea consistent with previously proposed models of plant gravity perception. These findings have been summarized in a manuscript now being prepared for submission to a top journal.",

That is, the specific orientation of lateral organs is genetically determined but controlled by the gravitropic responses of the lateral organs. The goal of this project was to use a combination of genetic, molecular, and physiological approaches to better understand the role of gravity in guiding whole plant development. Specifically, we used Arabidopsis as a model system for identifying genes required for controlling the GSA of later roots, rosette leaves and inflorescence branches. We have isolated a number of mutants that display altered GSA responses in lateral organs. The mutants have been designated mgsa mutants for modified gravitropic set-point angles. The molecular and physiological analyses of the mgsa mutants will provide new insight into the basis of GSA regulation and, thus, a better understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which plants use gravity to control their architecture.\nTo discover and characterize genes that are required for controlling the orientaion of lateral organs during plant development and to understand the mechanisms by which plants sense and respond to gravity.\nThe molecular and physiological analyses of the gsa mutants will provide new insight into the basis of GSA regulation and, thus, a better understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which plants use gravity to control their architecture.

            "task_progress": "We identified several genes that, when mutated, affect the orientation of lateral organs in Arabidopsis. A few of the genes specifically affect lateral roots and others affect the orientation of leaves and branches. We were able to map one of the genes, MGSA4 to a small region on chromosome 4. Plants with a mutant version of mgsa4 display vertically oriented leaves and inflorescence branches. Identification of the MGSA4 gene could potentially allow genetic engineering of plants with altered architectures for agronomic and ornamental uses.\nWe characterized the gravitropic behavior of lateral roots and shoots in Arabidopsis and a few other plant species. In all cases, we found that lateral organs orient relative to the gravity vector using the same basic gravitropic response system used buy the primary roots and shoots. However, unlike the primary root and shoot, which typically maintain vertical orientation, lateral organs position themselves more horizontally. Moreover, they change their orientation in a developmentally dependent manner. For example, a young Arabidopsis branch elongates at near 90 degrees from vertical for a few days but then repositions to angles of about 60 degrees from vertical. Our studies showed that these developmental changes in branch orientation result from a fundamental change in the gravitropic set point (GSA) of the organ. Our results provide the most complete analysis of the GSA and demonstrate how plant architecture is regulated by its alteration during normal plant development.\nWe identified several genes that when mutated alter the orientation of lateral organs. We identified four genes that specifically affect orientation of lateral roots and another three that specifically affect leaf and branch orientation. We were able to identify one of the root genes to be an allele of RHD3, which had been previously shown to affect root hair development. We initiated mapping of the other root-specific mutants but the phenotypes are difficult to score and progress was slow. The phenotype of the shoot mutants was more robust so we focused on one of those mutants, mgsa4, for detailed mapping and eventually gene identification.\nWe characterized the phenotype of the mgsa4 mutant in detail and fund that the altered gravitropic response is restricted to the lateral organs of the above ground part of the plant. Specifically, the main shoot displays normal vertical orientation and gravitropic responses during all stages of development. The leaves and lateral branches also display normal gravitropism in response to changes in orientation. That is, if a branch is reoriented, it reorients back to the original position just as robustly as in wild type plants. However, the lateral organs display a basal orientation that is as much as 40 degrees more vertical than wild type. Based on our physiological analyses, we were able to conclude that the mgsa4 gene specifically affects the overall orientation of the lateral organs without affecting the basal gravitropic machinery. Our results represent a novel demonstration of a fundamental aspect of plant gravity responses that has not been described before.\nUnfortunately, because this project was terminated prematurely, we were not able to identify the gene at the molecular level. Project personnel left the lab and manuscripts that were in early stages of preparation could not be completed.",

The most fundamental part of immune function is innate immunity, and this is reflected by the fact that innate immunity is a phylogenetically ancient system. The main studies that have revealed the similarities in the immune systems of vertebrates and invertebrates are those that compare the fruit fly Drosophila and mammals. In particular, many components of the signal transduction cascades involved in the response to infection are conserved in flies and humans. In Drosophila, this results in the induction of antimicrobial peptides, the hallmark of the humoral response. Similarly, conserved pathways in the cellular system are involved in immune cell growth and regulation. This project is designed to use the power of Drosophila as a model of innate immunity to investigate the effects of gravity on immune function. A key advantage of this approach is the ability to compare normal flies to mutant flies that are either defective in an aspect of immune function or defective in gravitational response.",

            "task_progress": "We have found that immune function in Drosophila is altered in conditions of hypergravity compared to normal gravity. Specifically, flies show a significant increase (P <0.05) in survival rates at 4g versus 1g after infection with the fungus Beauveria bassiana.   An increase in survival rate is consistent with either the infecting organism being weaker and/or the flies being stronger in response. By comparing these results to gravity-sensing mutants, the relative roles of gravity, host and pathogen can begin to be discerned. We thus tested yuri mutants, named after the Russian astronaut Yuri Gagarin and isolated as having a defective gravitaxis response, for their survival after infection and exposure to 4g hypergravity. The UAS-yuri rescue stock, which restores normal gravitaxis to yuri mutants, showed the same increase in survival as the other stocks tested. The yuri mutants, however, showed no change in survival at 4g compared to 1g. Thus, the data clearly indicate that gravity has an effect on the host response. This work was reported in the abstract, “Taylor, K. A., Kloehn, A. T, Fuller, P. M., Beckingham, K. M., Fuller, C. A. and Kimbrell, D. A., Alteration of gravitational force affects the immune response, 46th Annual Drosophila Research Conference, 2006,” and is being followed up by a corresponding manuscript.\nThese results with hypergravity and the yuri mutants made it clear that it is important to understand how gravity is sensed. Preliminary experiments related to determining how gravity is sensed have been published, “Syed, Z., Ishida, Y., Taylor, K., Kimbrell, D. A. and Leal, W. S. (2006) Pheromone reception in fruit flies expressing a moth's odorant receptor. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 103:16538-16543.”\nIn addition, we have found that the survival of infected flies is very different for male versus female flies. Generally, only male flies have been tested in immune response studies, and those that have tested females have addressed only specific features. Our studies have shown sex-specific differences in post-infection survival (P<0.01). This work is now published, “Taylor, K. and Kimbrell, D. A. (2007) Host immune response and differential survival of the sexes in Drosophila. Fly 1: 197-204.”\nA manuscript based on experiments to analyze blood cell melanotic tumor formation in Drosophila is in preparation.\nAll of these studies have also supported our FIT (Fungus, Immunity and Tumorigenesis) Flight Experiment, funded as grant NNA05CV0A, which flew successfully on the space shuttle Discovery in July 2006.\nAltogether, our experiments have shown significant changes in the immune response in altered gravitational forces. However, because of NASA’s budget cuts and virtual elimination of basic Life Sciences funding, these results cannot be completed and the new directions that these results have revealed cannot be followed up.",

An in-depth understanding of plant perception and responses to these challenges, particularly microgravity, will be essential for the development of life support systems, the production of food and for the psychological well-being of astronauts.  There is a substantial body of literature concerning the perception and responses of plants to gravity yet the process is poorly understood at the molecular and cellular level.  Recent evidence has established a link between endomembrane trafficking, vacuole biogenesis, auxin transport and gravitropism.  We developed a screen for mutants defective in vacuole biogenesis in Arabidopsis lines expressing a tonoplast marker (GFP::?TIP). The marker permits the vacuole to be visualized by confocal microscopy.  Representatives from at least two mutant classes display defects in shoot gravitropism.  Our NASA-funded research leverages these and other endomembrane mutants to understand mechanistic details of the gravitropic pathway.  Another aspect of our research is chemical library screening to identify compounds that affect gravitropic perception, signaling or response.  This approach presents an exciting new avenue towards expanding our insight into mechanisms underlying gravitropism and in defining potential pharmacological countermeasures to negative effects of microgravity.  During year one of NASA funding we have characterized and mapped to low resolution two novel gravitropic mutants that are defective in vacuole biogenesis.  Fine mapping and gene cloning are proceeding.  We have also completed an ambitious screen of a 10,000 compound chemical library and have identified at least three unique compounds (non-auxins) that inhibit gravitropism in Arabidopsis seedlings with additional bioactive compounds anticipated.  Identification of the gene targets will begin in the coming via genetic screens for mutants that are resistant or hypersensitive to our gravi-active compounds.  These results should provide new insights into mechanisms of gravity sensing, signal transduction and response in support of NASA ground-based and long-term spaceflight objectives.\nOur goal is to understand mechanisms of gravity perception, signaling and response by leveraging novel mutants that are defective in both gravitropism and endomembrane pathways and by identifying novel chemicals (and their cognate gene targets) that inhibit or enhance gravitropism.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Earth benefits are derived in several ways:  1.  The ability of plants (and animals) to orient themselves in response to gravity is essential for proper development.  Development is in turn a complex program involving multiple cellular pathways including hormones, gene regulation and vesicular transport.  Gravitropism intersects these pathways.  Thus its study will provide insights into complex developmental pathways that may result in improved growth habit and nutritional value of food crops.  2. Our mutants and chemicals affect both gravitropism and endomembrane and vacuole biogenesis.  All major seed crops such as maize, rice, wheat, soy and canola depend upon the deposition of proteins, lipids or starch in specialized vacuoles.  Our research will provide insight into vacuole biogenesis which may lead to the improved nutritional value and shelf life of seeds.  This has potential multibillion dollar vaue to the US economy."

During the period of funding we successfully identified one of the targets of  Gravicin and found it to be a member of the PGP family of auxin transporters.  Thus, we have a novel antagonist of auxin transport that also appears to have a  second target which impacts endomembrane trafficking. We are continuing to  pursue this and our other compounds for novel activities and targets at the  intersection of gravitropism and trafficking with a long-term goal of understanding  the link between these fundamental biological pathways.

            "task_description": "Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreactors offer a unique biotechnology approach to 3-D cell culture and advanced tissue engineering applications. In these fluid-filled Bioreactors, particles suspended in the culture medium rotate with the fluid in a quasi-solid body configuration. Cells and cell assemblies in this venue are in continual free fall and thus concomitantly exposed to low laminar shear stress (~ 0.5 dynes/cm2) and also to \"simulated or modeled microgravity \", i.e. to a time-averaged, randomized gravitational force (~0.01 x g). To date, the contribution of each of these factors, especially of reduced laminar shear stress, has not been thoroughly assessed experimentally. Based on reports in the literature and our own preliminary data, we hypothesize that the component which simulates/models microgravity by \"randomizing\" the gravitational vector, rather than low, laminar flow–induced shear stress, may be instrumental in modulating gene expression and functional differentiation of cells/cell assemblies in RWV Bioreactors. In testing our hypothesis, we propose to use genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics approaches for analyzing patterns of differential expression of genes and gene products in human endothelial cells cultured for various amounts of time (4 h –20 days) in RWV Bioreactors, with controls maintained static monolayers, static suspension cultures, or as monolayers in a parallel plate flow chamber exposed to fluid shear stress of 0.5 dynes/cm2. In addition, by using the Perfused Rotating Wall Vessel Reactors, we will be able induce controlled levels of fluid shear stress levels in these Bioreactors. Endothelial cells are chosen for this study, since a) the fluid-shear dependent gene activation in these cells is well established and characterized b) altered fluid dynamics and mechanical forces, such as present in RWV Bioreactors (and space flight?) are known risk factors in the etiology of diminished cardiac and cardiovascular function, specifically in the etiology of atherosclerosis. The objectives of this study are as follows: Specific aim 1: Compare differential gene expression in human microvascular endothelial cells cultured respectively, as monolayers under static conditions, or exposed to low levels of steady shear stress, and in suspension culture in Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreactors. Specific Aim 2: Compare differential protein expression in human microvascular endothelial cells cultured under the same conditions described above in Specific Aim1. Specific aim 3: Use modern bioinformatics approaches for identifying functional correlations between expression patterns of genes and gene products, specifically of signaling molecules and pathways, which uniquely are expressed (only) in RWV Bioreactors Specific Aim 4: Use established molecular biological approaches for identifying a unique RWV –sensitive response element in the promoter region of one or more RWV-responsive genes. While being responsive to several different stipulations of the soliciting NRA (01-OBPR-08), the objectives of this ground-based proposal is of relevance to NASA’s mission, as outlined in the Critical Path Roadmap, specifically, Risk 6 Diminished Cardiac and Vascular Function. In this context our study adresses Enbling Questions 6a-6c: Does long-duration space flight lead to diminished cardiac function? What mechanisms are involved? Is the process reversible?\n• In studying the workings of NASA developed RWV Bioreactor Biotechnology we are focusing on a) elucidating the value of low shear culturing and b) studying differential endothelial gene expression in RWV Bioreactors. • This study will distinguish between the effects of low shear and that of other parameters in the workings of RWV Bioreactors, specifically those components that may represent a ground-based microgravity analog. Furthermore, the comprehensive approach will lead to the identification of candidate mechanism and genes/gene products that are uniquely responsive to the modeled microgravity component of the RWV environment. • The outcome of this study will facilitate rationally designing meaningful space flight experiments, aimed at deciphering the mechanisms by which cells and organisms sense and transduce microgravity. Thus, this study provides a strong link and a clear path to flight research on the International Space Station and beyond for long-duration space flight. • The proposed studies entail strong educational components, both for our students as well as for students from local/regional schools.",

            "task_progress": "In the final year of this grant we have continued to make significant progress towards all  four specific aims. In order to identify from all genes uniquely identified as RWV related those unique genes, gene products and signaling pathways which are potentially affected by the component of modeled microgravity (MMG), we carried out a series of experiment with identical cell preparations in the different venues and analyzed their differential gene expression using Codelink microarrays (as detailed in the Methods section) followed by stringent statistical analysis of the data. As an example, as a first validation of the approach, we compared differential gene expression between static and flow conditions in the PPFC. The number of statistically significantly altered genes depended very much on the stringency of the analysis. Of the ~20,000 genes sported on the Codelink microarray , only ~ 12,000 genes were found to be reproducibly analyzable in 6 independent experiments. Of those we saw a statistically significant change in 790 genes at conventional stringency (95% confidence);   657 genes were found to be differentially expressed under high stringency (99% confidence, while only 60 genes were found to be differentially expressed at extreme stringency (99.9% confidence). By comparison, analysis of the data by high stringency ANOVA (99% confidence) yielded 552 genes that were differentially expressed between PPFC and static conditions.  Based on these results, all our subsequent analyses were based on ANOVA test with a 99% confidence (p< 0.01)\nUsing these state-of-the art tools, we have identified a number of genes which the diverse venues have in common, but also others, which are uniquely expressed in each of the venues investigated. Importantly, we have identified a limited number of genes (17) genes which seem to be uniquely are expressed (only) in RWV Bioreactors, and which may be related to the modeled microgravity (MMG) component in this venue. Two genes in this group, AQP3 (Aquaporin 3) and BMP1(Bone morphogenetic protein-1) are of specific interest.  As we have shown previously, RWV conditions favor the neuroendocrine differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells with concomitant downregulation of their neuronal phenotype. The unique expression of these two genes might explain some of our prior findings. AQP3 is a water channel protein that has been shown to play a role in the development of glandular tissue in the rat and is expressed in many tissues, including the basolateral membrane of pancreatic ducts and articular chondrocytes.  BMP1 is a calcium dependent metalloprotease not known to be structurally similar to any other human growth factors or the other members of the BMP family.  In humans BMP1 has been shown to both induce cartilage formation in vivo and inhibit neurogenesis.  The upregulation of either or both of these two factors, if more specifically demonstrated to play roles in developing the RWV phenotype, potentially helps explain the spontaneous differentiation of PC12 cells towards their neuroendocrine (rather than neural) phenotype, and the increased GAG production and layered, organized structures seen in chondrocyte cultures.\nIn evaluating possible functional relationships between the differentially expressed genes we used advanced systems biology-based bioinformatics tools, such as Ingenuity and PAINT. The Ingenuity Pathways Analysis application makes use of the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base, the world's largest proprietary and commercial curated database consisting of millions of individually modeled relationships between proteins, genes, complexes, cells, tissues, drugs, and diseases. PAINT (A Promoter Analysis and Interaction Network Generation Tool) is a unique open source data base and tools for Regulatory network identification. Both these bioinformatics tools in combination were to establish potential associations between gene circuits and signaling pathways.  Using the differential gene expression between static and low laminar shear stress flow activated cells in the PPFC as our initial paradigm for validation of the system, the analysis by both Ingenuity and PAINT revealed a central role for the transcription factor c-myc as the most common element in modulating differential gene expression). By contrast no such relations could be established for the MMG component in the RWV environment, presumable because of the small number of candidate genes that are uniquely attributable to be affected by MMG.\nIn addition to the genomics analysis we also carried out some proteomics-based studies. As a first step, total cell extracts were separated by 2-D gel electrophoresis and analyzed by differential protein profiling using fluorescent DIGE (differential in gel electrophoresis). Of the total number of 1310 resolved protein spots, 71 (5.4%) were decreased and 36 (2/7%) were increased by flow. In addition to global proteomics analysis, we also investigated at the protein level how the RWV conditions differentially affect the activation of specific signaling pathways. For this, we first analyzed the activation state of phosphorylation dependent protein kinases, using a commercially available proprietary protein kinase profiling tool (KPKS from KINEXUS). There is a similarity in the overall activation state/level of phosphorylation of several secondary messenger/transcription factors, such as JNK, FAK and GSK-3, as well of some of the PKC isoforms under static conditions and in bags, which is significantly different for m their activation profiles in the RWV. To further substantiate our conclusions in the human microvascular endothelial cell system, we have also directly measured the time course of activation of select signaling pathways, beta-testing a commercial phosphor array from BIOSOURCE. The kinetic results confirm our prior findings, that certain phosphorylation dependent cell signaling (e.g. through hormone receptors, such as EGFR or NGFR) is spontaneously upregulated for prolonged periods of time in RWV bioreactors. Specifically, the increase in AKT phosphorylation independently confirms our findings for an increased activity/expression of GSK-3.\nTaken together, our investigation of cell signaling in the RWV suggests that the state of activation of select signaling pathways/second messenger systems under static conditions and in a bag (aggregation) is quite similar in each of these venues, but qualitatively (and quantitatively different form when the cells are cultured in the HARV-type RWV.  Furthermore, these data are in line with our recent findings on the transient impairment of the immune response in human lymphocytes in the RWV environment. According to our data, the individual components of various post-receptor signal transduction cascades are not entirely abolished, but exposure, to the MMG causes quantitative imbalance in the level of activation of individual components.\nFinally, and beyond the original goals of the proposal, we developed a novel “horizontal microscopic”  module, that allows us to analyze in real time  particle movement and, especially, cell aggregation in HARV-type RWV Bioreactors.  The rational for this approach (part of a new MD/PhD thesis) is to a) develop algorithms which will allow the automated rotational control of the RWV Bioreactors  depending on the state of aggregation of the rotating particles ad b) to develop and validate computational algorithms for modeling cell aggregation in  3-D. Finally, as a new technological advance, we are working on a novel optical system to determine in real-time the aggregation kinetics in RWV Bioreactors. We anticipate that the novel methodology and algorithms developed in this work will enhance our ability for non-invasive, remote monitoring and data analysis during the exploration to Moon and Mars.",

For instance, it is possible that exposure to high-energy protons and heavy ions within galactic cosmic rays or solar particle events can induce a range of CNS injuries, including cognitive impairment. While the pathogenesis of radiation-induced cognitive impairment is not clear, we have shown that neuronal precursor cells in the hippocampus may be involved. Using low doses of X-rays (1-5 Gy), we have demonstrated, in vitro and in vivo, that neural stem cells of the hippocampus are exquisitely sensitive to irradiation. In addition, these cells exhibit oxidative stress and undergo apoptosis after irradiation. Low dose x-irradiation of these cells in vitro also leads to a persistent oxidative stress that coincides temporally with a dose-dependent reduction in neurogenesis observed in vivo. Consequently, we hypothesize that oxidative stress plays a contributory if not causative role in regulating the radiation response of neural stem cells in vitro and in vivo. Further, we suggest that oxidative stress constitutes a biochemical mechanism that can influence the fate of stem cell differentiation in vitro and hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo.   It is our overall objective to determine how oxidative stress affects the high LET radiation response of precursor cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus and to identify compounds/strategies that will enable us to ameliorate the adverse effects of high LET irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis. We have defined 4 specific aims to address our objective.\nAim 1: Using in vitro and in vivo models, determine if deficiencies in site-specific superoxide dismutases (SODs) lead to acute (days) oxidative stress and altered neurogenesis after exposure to high-energy protons.\nAim 2: Using in vitro and in vivo models, determine if deficiencies in site-specific superoxide dismutases (SODs) lead to chronic (months) oxidative stress and altered differentiation/neurogenesis following exposure to high-energy iron ions.\nAim 3: Determine if antioxidant treatment with SOD/catalase mimetic agents reduce high-LET induced radiation injury to neural stem cells in vitro and ameliorate the radiation-induced inhibition of neurogenesis in vivo.\nAim 4: Quantify the effects of high-energy iron ions on cognitive function in wild type mice and determine if antioxidant treatment ameliorates those effects.",

NASA funding has laid the groundwork for a number of studies that have now clearly established a significant role for oxidative stress in modulating the CNS response to high and low LET ionizing radiations.  These studies were the first to demonstrate the space relevant radiation doses (= 1 Gy) led to significant increases (>10-fold) in oxidative stress that persisted (> 2 months) for long-periods after initial exposure.   Corroborating in vivo work has established a temporal correlation between in vitro endpoints, and has helped to validate the importance of oxidative injury and secondary reactive processes in the brain that contribute to impaired neurogenesis and cognition.  NASA funding has been critical in advancing our knowledge of the response of the CNS to heavy ion irradiation.  Our proof of principle studies have now demonstrated the importance of oxidative processes in the irradiated CNS, and provide the necessary framework for advancing these studies further, to elucidate the mechanistic basis of cognitive impairment in the CNS that will be critical in establishing valid risk estimates.\nTo date we have undertaken 6 runs at BNL (two runs in 2005, 2006 and 2007) as well as two runs at Loma Linda.  We have now successfully irradiated a large number of in vitro samples as well as our SOD3 knockout mice, mice heterozygous for all three SOD isoforms (CuZnSOD, MnSOD and SOD3) and all relevant WT control mice.  With these studies, we continue to make significant progress in completing the objectives outlined in this grant.  Major accomplishments are summarized below:\n1)\tIn vitro studies using hippocampal and subventricular neural precursor cells have revealed that 56Fe-ions induce marked levels of oxidative stress.  Reactive oxygen species detected after heavy ion irradiation are 2-10 fold higher at various times (6-48h) after irradiation.\n2)\tIn vitro studies using hippocampal neural precursor cells have shown protons to be more efficient at eliciting oxidative stress than X-rays.\n3)\tThe antioxidant lipoic acid has shown promise at reducing radiation-induced ROS, whether added as a radioprotector (before irradiation) or as a mitigating agent (after irradiation).\n4)\tComprehensive analysis of our EC-SOD (extracellular SOD) deficient (nullizygous) mice has now shown that these animals are actually protected from the inhibition of neurogenesis after irradiation.  While this result is qualitatively similar between low and high LET radiations, heavy ions do show important differences, possibly due to changing levels of activated microglia.  This provocative data now shows for the first time that altering the redox status of the microenvironment can be protective to certain adverse radiation effects in the animal.\n5)\tNew evidence now reveals that the neuroprotective effects of EC-SOD deficiency are also found in animals deficient for the other two isoforms of SOD.  Analysis of Cu/Zn-SOD (the cytosolic isoform) and Mn-SOD (the mitochondrial isoform) deficient mice have show that neurogenesis is also spared after irradiation in these animals.  Quantification of immunohistochemical staining continues, but the trend has now been verified statistically, and supports our overall contention that changes in oxidative stress play pivotal roles in the radioresponse of the CNS.\n6)\tChronic studies analyzing oxidative stress in neural precursor cells that have been exposed to a range of Fe ion doses (0.1 – 2 Gy) have nearly been repeated.  This new data has revealed significant increases in oxidative stress that persist over background levels for over two months after initial irradiation.  Use of two different fluorogenic dyes now suggests that a fraction of the net increase in oxidative species emanates from the mitochondria.\n7)\tStudies exposing neural precursor cells to Fe ions at very low doses (1-15 cGy) have shown oxidative stress to be significantly elevated over acute times (12-24h) after irradiation.\n8)\tWe have recently expanded our low dose studies down to particle fluences spanning the range of 500 - 30,000 Fe particles/cm2.  At these ultra-low particle fluences not every cell (or neurosphere) is traversed by an energetic ion particle.  However, oxidative stress is still elevated significantly over background.  These data suggest that bystander effects are occurring in the irradiated neural precursor cells.  Furthermore, the mechanism/s underlying these bystander effects is/are likely to involve oxidative species derived from the small subpopulation of traversed cells, that then impact the entire population to elicit significant increase in oxidative stress.\n9)\tWe have also just recently undertaken a series of studies to determine whether our irradiated neural precursor cells show signs of an adaptive response.  In summary, fractionated dosing paradigms result in sparing of oxidative stress when compared to the same dose delivered acutely.  Evidence strongly suggests that both reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are involved, and that prior exposure desensitizes these cells to a subsequent dose of heavy ions.\n10)\t Funding from this Grant has resulted in 18 formal presentations at national and international meetings, as well as an assortment of research and teaching seminars at various universities and national laboratories across the country.\n11)\tFunding from this Grant has resulted in 8 published manuscripts and several in preparation.",

            "task_description": "These studies address the mechanisms and functional significance of how simulated microgravity affects vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cell function of cerebral resistance arteries. Alterations in vascular function induced by microgravity are particularly relevant to the problem of orthostatic intolerance experienced by astronauts upon re-entry into the Earth's gravitational field. Previous research has demonstrated that reductions in blood volume and altered baroreflex control of the cardiovascular system contribute to, but do not fully account for changes in orthostatic tolerance. To investigate the effects of microgravity on the cerebral circulation, head-down tail-suspension (HDT) of rats were used as a ground-based model of microgravity because HDT, like actual microgravity, induces a headward fluid shift. It is now evident that the shift of fluid toward the head and the corresponding increase in cephalic hydrostatic pressure alter the mechanical forces exerted on cerebral resistance arteries, the vessels responsible for regulating cerebral perfusion. For example, it has now been demonstrated that medial layer (smooth muscle) hypertrophy occurs in cerebral resistance arteries (middle cerebral and basilar) and that vasoconstrictor responsiveness of these arteries to mechanical stimuli (transmural pressure and shear stress) and vasoconstrictor agonist (KCl) is enhanced by HDT. The purpose of the present proposal was to address four specific aims: 1) to determine whether alterations in the release of an endothelium-derived vasodilator substance(s) accounts for the enhanced spontaneous tone and vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the middle cerebral artery, 2) to determine whether the smooth muscle hypertrophy and the thickening of the medial layer alters the mechanical properties (structural behavior and material properties) of the middle cerebral artery, 3) to determine the mechanism(s) of how HDT alters endothelium-mediated vasodilation, and 4) whether reported cerebral vascular alterations affect blood flow distribution and vascular resistance within the brain. This work is justified by the fact that it provides potentially important information about the mechanisms contributing to the orthostatic intolerance of astronauts returning to Earth. Such information may be useful in the development of more effective countermeasures. The impact of simulated microgravity on maximal responsiveness and sensitivity of resistance arteries to a variety of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents, each acting through different mechanisms, will be determined. This work will provide potentially important information about the mechanism(s) underlying the orthostatic intolerance of astronauts returning to Earth. Such information would be useful in the development of more effective countermeasures.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The studies supported through this grant are significant and provide Earth benefits in several respects. First, these studies provide new information regarding how altered physical forces (transmural pressure and shear stress) induced by simulated microgravity impact the biological function and structure of cerebral resistance arteries. Such changes may also occur during prolonged bed rest. Second, blood flow and vascular resistance measurements demonstrate that the effects of cerebral vascular adaptations are not generalized throughout the brain but rather are specific to discrete regions. Such data provide potentially important information about the effects of cerebral vascular remodeling on motor, neurovestibular, sleep/circadian rhythm, and cardiorespiratory control regions within the brain. Third, these studies are significant because they address the problem of reduced orthostatic tolerance in astronauts through an enhanced cerebral autoregulation mechanism. Increased understanding of this vascular mechanism may assist others in the development of more targeted countermeasures to offset the impact of fluid shifts toward the head. And finally, the results from this work may help scientists and clinicians better understand cardiovascular disorders occurring in the general population. For example, orthostatic intolerance is the primary underlying cause of emergency room visits among the elderly, such as hip fracture resulting from light headedness when standing. In addition, endothelial dysfunction occurs with primary aging and underlies many of the cardiovascular pathologies found in western society. Although the stimulus for or mechanism of endothelial dysfunction may vary among the various disorders, results from these studies may provide important new information regarding the impact of cerebral artery endothelial dysfunction on orthostatic intolerance and brain perfusion."

            "task_progress": "I. Increases in myogenic, shear stress and agonist-induced vasoconstriction in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) with head-down tail-suspension (HDT) in rats are the result of alterations in the release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide (NO). Myogenic, shear stress, and KCl-induced vasoconstriction will be tested in the MCA from control and HDT rats with an intact and removed endothelial cell layer and in the presence and absence of the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME).   These studies have been completed and the results have been published in the American Journal of Physiology: Heart and Circulatory Physiology (Wilkerson, MK, LA Lesniewski, EM Golding, RM Bryan, A Amin, E Wilson, and MD Delp. Simulated microgravity enhances cerebral artery vasoconstriction and vascular resistance through an endothelial nitric oxide mechanism. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 288: H1652-H1661, 2005). The results demonstrate that simulated microgravity enhances basal tone and vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries, therefore potentially limiting cerebral perfusion during periods of altered gravitational stress (e.g., during standing after return from a weightless environment). When applied to the human condition, these results suggest that alterations in cerebral autoregulation associated with microgravity or prolonged bedrest may be the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor tone of cerebral arteries.\nII. The mechanism through which the endothelium mediates vasodilation of MCAs is altered by HDT, so that there is less vasodilation through the nitric oxide synthase pathway and more vasodilation through the release of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Vasodilation induced by 2-methylthio-ATP (2MeS-ATP) and bradykinin, two endothelium-dependent vasodilators, will be determined in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, and the Ca2+-activated K+ channel inhibitors charybdotoxin and apamin.\nThese studies have been completed and the results have been published in the Journal of Applied Physiology under a Highlighted Topic in the journal: Regulation of the Cerebral Circulation (Prisby RD, MK Wilkerson, EM Sokoya, RM Bryan, E Wilson, and MD Delp. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries is altered with simulated microgravity through nitric oxide synthase and EDHF mechanisms. J. Appl. Physiol. 101: 348-353, 2006). The results demonstrate that 2-MeS-ATP and BK-elicited vasodilation is diminished in MCAs from HDT rats, and that this attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation occurs through alterations in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) signaling pathway. Furthermore, the diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation is associated with reduced NOS and caveolin-1 protein expression. Concomitant with the attenuated NOS component of the 2-MeS-ATP mediated vasodilation is an enhancement of an EDHF-mediated vasodilator component in MCAs from HDT rats, as determined through the inhibition of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Although the up-regulation of an EDHF signaling mechanisms appears to partially compensate for the diminished NOS signaling pathway, the net effect is that endothelium-dependent vasodilation in HDT rats remains lower than that in cerebral arteries from control animals. The functional consequence of these vascular alterations with HDT appears to be greater cerebral vascular resistance and lower cerebral perfusion. When applied to the human condition, these results suggest that reported alterations in cerebral autoregulation associated with microgravity or prolonged bedrest may be the result of diminished levels of cerebral artery endothelial nitric oxide (NO). Although diminished NO bioavailability may be an appropriate adaptation of the cerebral vasculature to the elevations in arterial pressure associated with chronic headward fluid shifts, this adaptive response may limit the ability of cerebral vasculature to respond to abrupt alterations in pressure, such as that which occurs with orthostatic stress.\nIII. The smooth muscle hypertrophy and the corresponding increase in MCA medial thickness induced by HDT will diminish the passive pressure-diameter relationship and increase the stiffness of MCAs. The structural behavior and material properties of the MCA from control and HDT rats will be compared to determine whether structural vascular alterations affect the stiffness of these arteries, and thus, how readily the arteries will vasodilate during smooth muscle cell relaxation.\nThese studies have been completed and the results have been published in the American Journal of Physiology: Heart and Circulatory Physiology (Wilkerson, MK, LA Lesniewski, EM Golding, RM Bryan, A Amin, E Wilson, and MD Delp. Simulated microgravity enhances cerebral artery vasoconstriction and vascular resistance through an endothelial nitric oxide mechanism. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 288: H1652-H1661, 2005). Results from these studies indicated that although smooth muscle hypertrophy occurred in the smooth muscle (medial) layer of cerebral arteries from HDT rats, it did not change the mechanical properties of the cerebral arteries (i.e., it did not increase stiffness) as indicated by the passive pressure-diameter relation being unaltered.\nIV. The net effect of HDT-induced alterations in cerebral resistance artery vasoconstrictor responsiveness, vasodilator responsiveness, or mechanical properties is a diminished cerebral perfusion and elevated cerebral vascular resistance. Total cerebral perfusion, brain blood flow distribution, and total and regional cerebral vascular resistance will be determined in control and HDT rats during horizontal (0o tilt) and 75o head-up tilt.\nThese studies have been completed and the results have been published in the American Journal of Physiology: Heart and Circulatory Physiology (Wilkerson, MK, LA Lesniewski, EM Golding, RM Bryan, A Amin, E Wilson, and MD Delp. Simulated microgravity enhances cerebral artery vasoconstriction and vascular resistance through an endothelial nitric oxide mechanism. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 288: H1652-H1661, 2005). The results demonstrate that following a 2 wk period of simulated microgravity, cerebral perfusion is lower and vascular resistance is higher in several regions of the brain when the animals are normally standing in the horizontal position. During head-up tilt, the HDT rats become hypotensive. However, despite this hypotension, cerebral vascular resistance is higher and perfusion is lower than that of control animals in several regions of the brain, including those involved in cardiorespiratory control, the maintenance of equilibrium, hearing, vision and circadian rhythm regulation. Therefore, these data suggest that spaceflight and bedrest-induced deficits in locomotion, balance and orthostatic tolerance may be related to regional reductions in perfusion of key regulatory areas within the brain.\nV. Additional Studies:\nResults from Specific Aim IV demonstrated that during head-up tilt, HDT rats demonstrated a lack of ability to maintain mean arterial pressure, similar to the orthostatic hypotension observed in astronauts upon return to Earth. It had been hypothesized that the orthostatic hypotension might be related to a diminished vasoconstrictor response in the splanchnic circulation. Few studies have been conducted to address this question. Therefore, a series of experiments were conducted to determine, 1) whether mesenteric veins and arteries exhibit diminished constrictor responsiveness, 2) the mechanism for the diminished vasoconstrictor responses, and 3) the possible stimulus for the hypo-responsiveness of the splanchnic vasculature. Results of these studies are in press in the Journal of Applied Physiology and the American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology. Because of the significance of the results in these studies, both are being published with an editorial to highlight the work.\nThe results demonstrate that, within the same vascular bed, there is a reduced constriction of mesenteric arteries and veins to norepinephrine. This adrenergic hypo-responsiveness occurs in a vascular bed where blood flow and arterial pressure alterations do not occur as a result of the HDT intervention. Therefore, this suggests that the HDT-induced vascular effects on smooth muscle cells in this region are mediated by a systemic circulating factor(s) rather than altered hydrodynamic mechanical influences. Consistent with this hypothesis is an elevation of plasma atrial (ANP) and brain (NT-proBNP) natriuretic peptide concentrations in HDT rats, which were found to inhibit constrictor responses of mesenteric arteries and veins to adrenergic stimulation. The data demonstrate that in addition to norepinephrine, hindlimb unloading diminishes the vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric arteries to KCl and caffeine, but does not affect myogenic vasoconstriction within a physiological range of pressures. The reduced vasoconstrictor response to caffeine along with a lower RyR2 mRNA and protein expression indicates that the attenuated vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric arteries is the result of an impaired intracellular Ca2+ release. If similar alterations in mesenteric resistance artery function occur in humans during prolonged exposure to microgravity or bedrest, this would likely affect the ability to augment peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac output during orthostatic and exercise stresses. Thus, the functional consequences of these vascular alterations may include orthostatic and exercise intolerance commonly associated with actual and simulated microgravity.",

It is now evident that the shift of fluid toward the head and the unloading of postural muscles alter the mechanical forces exerted on arteries, the vessels responsible for regulating blood flow and arterial blood pressure.  For example, the smooth muscle cells in the small arteries of hindlimb skeletal muscle atrophies with tail suspension, and results in a diminished ability of these vessels to constrict.  The compromised ability to constrict reduces the ability of the rats to maintain normal blood pressure, and consequently, these animals are susceptible to orthostatic hypotension (an abnormal reduction in arterial pressure when the body position of the rat is moved from a horizontal position to a 70o vertical head-up position).  The purpose of the present study is to determine whether the fluid shifts and reduced activity of postural muscles that are induced by microgravity similarly alter rodent arterial vessel structure and function.  In other words, does space flight result in a diminished ability of arteries to constrict, and if so, is this the result of smooth muscle atrophy.

            "task_progress": "AIM 1-\nTo better understand how cells sense and respond to changes in mechanical forces exerted on their extracellular matrix adhesions, we applied tensional forces to magnetic microbeads bound to cell surface integrin receptors using magnetic pulling cytometry and measured dynamic changes in bead displacement with sub-micrometer resolution using optical microscopy. These studies revealed that cells exhibit four distinct types of mechanical responses: 1) an immediate viscoelastic response to a brief 3 second force pulse that resulted in almost complete elastic recovery, 2) early adaptive behavior characterized by pulse-to-pulse attenuation in bead displacement in response to an oscillatory force regimen composed of multiple brief (3 second) force pulses separated by short (4 second) relaxation periods, 3) later adaptive cell stiffening in response to sustained (> 15 second) static stresses, and 4) a large-scale repositioning response in which beads exposed to prolonged (> 1 minute) static stresses were retracted back by the cell against the applied force.  Importantly, these forms of cellular adaptation differed biochemically.  Whereas the immediate viscoelastic response and early adaptation behavior were affected by dissipating cytoskeletal prestress (isometric tension) with inhibitors of either myosin ATPase or Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), the later adaptive response to longer (> 15 second) stresses was not sensitive to either of these inhibitors. The large-scale repositioning of beads in response to prolonged (> 1 minute) stress was prevented by inhibiting myosin-based tension generation through interference with Rho signaling, similar to the case of the immediate and early responses, but in addition it was prevented by blocking mechanosensitive ion channels using gadolinium or by inhibiting tyrosine kinases using PP2. All of these adaptive responses were suppressed by cooling the cells to 4°C to slow biochemical remodeling events, and the large-scale repositioning response required that integrins be chemically activated through occupancy of the RGD binding site.  These results demonstrate that cells use multiple distinct mechanisms, including activation of small G proteins, to sense and respond to static and dynamic changes in the physical properties of the extracellular matrix that alter the level of mechanical stress applied to cell surface integrin receptors.\nThe formation of focal adhesions that mediate alterations of cell shape and movement is controlled by a mechanochemical mechanism in which cytoskeletal tensional forces drive changes in molecular assembly; however, little is known about the molecular biophysical basis of this response. In the past grant period, we developed a method to measure the unbinding rate constant  of individual GFP-labeled focal adhesion molecules in living cells by modifying the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique and combining it with mathematical modeling. Using this method, we showed that decreasing cellular traction forces on focal adhesions by three different techniques – chemical inhibition of cytoskeletal tension generation, laser incision of an associated actin stress fiber, or use of compliant extracellular matrices – increases the   of the focal adhesion protein zyxin. In contrast, the    of another adhesion protein, vinculin, remains unchanged after tension dissipation. Mathematical models also demonstrated that these force-dependent increases in zyxin’s   that occur over seconds are sufficient to quantitatively predict large-scale focal adhesion disassembly that occurs physiologically over many minutes. These findings demonstrate that the molecular binding kinetics of some, but not all, focal adhesion proteins are sensitive to mechanical force, and suggest that force-dependent changes in this biophysical parameter may govern the supramolecular events that underlie focal adhesion remodeling in living cells.\nAim 2-\nThe small GTPase Rho plays a central role in integrin-dependent control of cell contractility, and has been shown to be activated by mechanical force application to surface integrin receptors. But the molecular basis of this mechanotransduction response remains unclear.  To explore if mechanical force activates Rho downstream of integrin receptor activation, we plated endothelial cells on BioFlex membranes coated with a non-activating (K20) ß1 integrin antibody and Rho activation was measured by either the Rhotekin pull-down assay (Western blotting) or a novel FRET-based assay (confocal microscopy) after mechanical stretching.  Application of mechanical force (15% strain) for 15 min significantly increased Rho activation in these cells compared to control cells. To determine the possible mechanism of Rho activation, we measured the translocation of p190Rho-GAP from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton fraction because this is an upstream regulator of Rho activity.  We found that mechanical stretch increased the translocation of both p190RhoGAP and the tyrosine kinase, c-src, to the cytoskeletal fraction, and that this response paralleled the time course of Rho activation. To further confirm that mechanical force application activated Rho, we transfected these endothelial cells with a RhoFRET probe (Raich-RBD) which detects the changes in endogenous Rho activity. FRET efficiency was measured using the acceptor-photobleach method. Preliminary results suggest that application of 15% mechanical strain to cells adherent to fibronectin-coated BioFlex plates for 15 min induced a statistically significant decrease in FRET efficiency which is indicative of Rho activation in response to mechanical force.  Taken together, these results strongly suggest that mechanical force application through ß1 integrins results in stress-dependent activation of Rho.\nAim 3-\nMechanical stresses that are preferentially transmitted across the cell surface via transmembrane integrin receptors activate gene transcription by triggering production of intracellular chemical second messengers, such as cAMP.  In the past grant period, we showed that the sensitivity of the cAMP signaling pathway to mechanical stresses transferred across ß1 integrins is mediated by force-dependent activation of some heterotrimeric G protein.  During the grant funding period, we showed that Gas is recruited to focal adhesions that form within minutes following clustering of ß1 integrins induced by cell binding to magnetic microbeads coated with activating integrin ligands, and that ß1 integrin and Gas co-precipitate when analyzed biochemically. Stress application to activated ß1 integrins using magnetic twisting cytometry increases Gas recruitment and activates these large G proteins within focal adhesions, as measured by binding of biotinylated azido-anilido-GTP, whereas application of similar stresses to inactivated, integrins or control histocompatibility antigens has little effect.  This response is relevant physiologically as application of mechanical strain to cells bound to flexible extracellular matrix-coated substrates induce translocation of phospho-CREB to the nucleus, which can be attenuated by inhibiting Gas activity, either using the inhibitor melittin or suppressing its expression using siRNA. Although integrins are not typical G protein-coupled receptors, these results show that integrins focus mechanical stresses locally on heterotrimeric G proteins within focal adhesions at the site of force application, and transduce mechanical stimuli into an intracellular cAMP signaling response by activating Gas at these membrane signaling sites.\nAccurate understanding of cellular mechanotransduction through integrins and G proteins requires knowledge of how heterotrimeric G proteins associate with focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are large, complex and dynamic structures and the full complement of focal adhesion proteins are not known. Therefore, to determine the adaptor proteins bridging integrins to G proteins, we made a series of integrin mutants designed to disrupt large portions of the focal adhesion.  In our last year of funding, we genetically engineered a series of six consecutive mutations covering the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the ß1 integrin based on known interactions from the literature. These mutations are all made in chimeric constructs where the extracellular domain of integrin has been replaced with carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) epitope allowing us to selectively bind and study our mutants in the presence of wildtype integrins. We also generated two sets of integrin mutants, one with the ß1 transmembrane domain and another where the transmembrane domain has been replaced with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) transmembrane domain. Importantly, in preliminary studies using these mutants, we found that the cytoplasmic region of ß1 integrin is sufficient to support focal adhesion formation as determined by cell spreading and fluorescence microscopic analysis. Our preliminary studies indicate that, as expected, the various cytoplasmic mutants have differential spreading efficiencies. In addition, some have decreased focal adhesion strength in response to pulling through focal adhesions formed on CAIV antibody-coated beads despite their ability to spread on CAIV coated substrates indicating that the focal adhesion is partially disrupted. Therefore, these chimeras should be extremely useful tools for the dissection of mechanosensitive signal transduction through integrins and G proteins.",

            "task_description": "Bacteria in nature and disease often choose a mode of growth known as a biofilm, which consists of numerous aggregating microorganisms (microcolonies) attached to a surface. Biofilm formation is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia which can be acquired by astronauts during a long-term space mission and by patients with compromised immune systems such as those with cystic fibrosis. A capsular material called mucoid exopolysaccharide, or alginate is important in the formation of biofilms because it provides a key structural component for in vivo biofilms. The objective of this proposal is to study the genetic regulation of alginate in biofilm formation. The model organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous biofilm-forming bacterium capable of displaying two distinctive phenotypes: a nonmucoid or mucoid colony morphology. The mucoid form, which is due to the overproduction of alginate, is a clinical indicator for a poor prognosis. While the two morphologies can be made inter-changeable under the laboratory conditions, little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing this process. Using genetics and functional genomics approaches, we will search for the biofilm “switches” on the genomes. The identified genes may become targets for the development of anti-biofilm therapeutics. The specific aims of this project are i) to identify and characterize the genes in the alginate regulation, ii) to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and iii) determine what/how environmental signals modulate the expression of these regulators. Our long-term goal is to target bacterial own genes for the control of the space biofilm formation.\nThe objective of the proposed research is to identify and characterize the biofilm-controlling genetic elements from the genomes of P. aeruginosa.\nIt is our expectation that the approaches used here will lead us to identify the genes that control the formation of the mucoid biofilms. We will also provide new information regarding how these genes control the phenotypic switch, and what/how environmental signals may stimulate or inhibit the expression of these genes. These results will be significant, because they will provide genetic targets for anti-biofilm therapeutics, and aid in the future development of the gene-based space medicine. In addition, it is expected that the results will advance the emerging field of microbial biofilms.",

            "task_progress": "Identification of three new regulators for alginate biosynthesis.  We have continued the global transposon screen to search for the novel regulators for mucoid biofilms in P. aeruginosa.  Instead, screening the wild-type nonmucoid to mucoid conversion, we took a reverse approach by screening for conversion from stable, mucoid mutant to nonmucoid reversion due to the transposon mutagenesis.  We identified three new genes that serve as positive regulators for alginate biosynthesis.  It is known that alginate production is regulated by the ECF sigma factor, AlgU/T, and the cognate anti-sigma factor, MucA.  Many clinical mucoid isolates carry the loss-of-function mutations in mucA.  These mutations, including the most common mucA22 allele, cause C-terminal truncations in MucA, indicating an inability to regulate the AlgU activity by MucA is associated with conversion to the mucoid phenotype.  We found that a mutation in a stable mucoid strain derived from the parental strain PAO1, designated PAO581, that does not contain the mucA22 allele, was due to a single base deletion in mucA (delta T180), generating another type of C-terminal truncation.  A global mariner transposon screen in PAO581 for non-mucoid isolates led to the identification of three regulators of alginate production, clpP (PA1801), clpX (PA1802), and a clpP paralog (PA3326, designated clpP2).  The PAO581 null mutants of clpP, clpX, and clpP2 showed a decrease in AlgU transcriptional activity and an accumulation of HA-tagged, N-terminal MucA protein with an apparent molecular mass of 15kDa.  The clpP and clpX mutants of a CF mucoid isolate revert to the non-mucoid phenotype.  The ClpXP and ClpP2 proteins appear to be part of a proteolytic network degrading the cytoplasmic portion of truncated MucA proteins to release the sequestered AlgU, which drives alginate biosynthesis.  This work has been published in Microbiology (Qiu, D., V. M. Eisinger, N. E. Head, G. B. Pier, and H. D. Yu. 2008. ClpXP proteases positively regulate alginate over-expression and mucoid conversion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Microbiol. 154: 2119-2130).\nDevelopment of a set of versatile and controllable expression vectors.  We have reported the construction of a series of Escherichia-Pseudomonas broad-host-range expression vectors utilizing the PBAD promoter and the araC regulator for routine cloning, conditional expression, and analysis of tightly controlled and/or toxic genes in pseudomonads.  This work has been published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology (Qiu, D., F. H. Damron, T. Mima, H. P. Schweizer, and H. D. Yu. 2008. PBAD-based shuttle vectors for functional analysis of toxic and highly-regulated genes in Pseudomonas and Burkholderia spp. and other bacteria. Appl. Environ. Microbiol.74: 7422-7426).\nIdentification of a new mechanism regulating alginate overproduction in P. aeruginosa.  Mucoidy or overproduction of the exopolysaccharide known as alginate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a poor prognosticator for lung infections in cystic fibrosis.  Mutation of the anti-s factor MucA is a well-accepted mechanism for mucoid conversion.  However, certain clinical mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa have a wild-type (wt) mucA.  Here, we describe a loss-of-function mutation in kinB that causes overproduction of alginate in the wt mucA strain PAO1.  KinB is the cognate histidine kinase for the transcriptional activator AlgB.  Increased alginate production due to inactivation of kinB was correlated with the high expression at the alginate-related promoters PalgU and PalgD.  Deletion of alternative s factor RpoN (?54) or the response regulator AlgB in kinB mutants decreases alginate production to wt nonmucoid levels.  Mucoidy was restored in the kinB algB double mutant by expression of wt AlgB or phosphorylation defective AlgB.D59N, indicating that phosphorylation of AlgB was not required for alginate overproduction when kinB was inactivated.  The inactivation of the DegS-like protease algW in the kinB mutant caused loss of alginate production and an accumulation of the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MucA.  Furthermore, we observed the kinB mutation increased the rate of HA-MucA degradation.  Our results also indicate AlgW-mediated MucA degradation requires algB and rpoN in the kinB mutant.  Collectively, these studies indicate KinB is a negative regulator of alginate production in wt mucA strain PAO1.  This paper has been accepted for publication by Journal of Bacteriology (Damron, F. H., D. Qiu, and H. D. Yu. Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensor kinase KinB negatively controls alginate production through AlgW-dependent MucA proteolysis. J. Bacteriol. Accepted).\nIdentification of a stress-responsive novel lipoprotein in mucoid, alginate overproducing P. aeruginosa.  Chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa and excessive neutrophils-associated inflammation are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  Overproduction of an exopolysaccharide known as alginate leads to the formation of mucoid biofilms that are resistant to antibiotics and host defenses.  Alginate overproduction or mucoidy is controlled by a stress-related ECF sigma factor AlgU/T.  Mutation in the anti-sigma factor MucA is a known mechanism for conversion to mucoidy.  Recently, we identified inactivation of a kinase (KinB) in PAO1 caused overproduction of alginate.  Here we report the identification of lipotoxin F (LptF, PA3692), an outer membrane protein F paralog whose expression increased in PAO1 kinB mutant (PAO1kinB::aacC1).  The lipotoxin family was previously characterized to induce inflammation in lung epithelia.  Inactivation of lptF had no effect on mucoidy.  Deletion of lptF caused a differential susceptibility to phagocyte-generated oxidants.  The lptF, algU and algW mutants were more sensitive to hypochlorite than parent PAO1.  However, the lptF mutant displayed increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide, indicating LptF may mediate resistance to bactericidal activity of neutrophils.  Expression of LptF was AlgU-dependent and observed in CF isolates.  LptF also mediated adhesion to human lung epithelial cells (A549).  The lptF promoter activity increased upon exposure to ultraviolet irradiation (UV-B).  Collectively, LptF, a stress response marker, may be required for P. aeruginosa survival in harsh environments including lung colonization in CF.  The paper has been submitted and is currently in revision (Damron, F. H., J. Napper, M. A. Teter, and H. D. Yu. Lipotoxin F in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an AlgU-dependent and alginate independent stress response marker that mediates resistance to oxidative stress and adhesion to A549 human lung epithelia. Microbiol. In revision).\nSubmission of the second patent application for developing novel methods for producing bacterial alginates.  Currently, alginate is made from seaweeds.  The large-scale sea farming of seaweeds poses a direct threat to the environment.  In addition, the level of polymerization, monosaccharide polydispersity of seaweed alginates cannot be controlled.  Bioprocessing and separation of certain types of seaweed alginates are expensive.  Both strains of high alginate producers that are patent-pending are being utilized by Progenesis Technologies, LLC as prototypes for commercialization of bacterial alginates.  Progenesis Technologies, LLC is a startup biotech company co-founded by Dr. Niles and Dr. Yu from Marshall University and has acquired the exclusive license from Marshall University Research Corporation to utilize this technology for the production of alginates.  Since its founding in 2006, Progenesis has raised enough capitals from private investors.  It has been in operation since Feb. 2008, and located in a biotech business incubator managed by the Chemical Alliance Zone (CAZ) in South Charleston, West Virginia.",

            "task_description": "The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify the structural and functional changes that occur in the utricle of the vestibular labyrinth as the result of transitions from one gravitational level into another. This information is critical for advancing our understanding of neurovestibular adaptation and its sequelae. Our strategy is to use centrifugation as a tool for temporarily altering the gravitational stimulus. We are particularly interested in determining the afferent firing rate and response characteristics and the morphological changes in the hair cell-afferent complexes found in the utricle that are modified when the organism moves from normal gravity (1G) to hyper-gravity (hyper-G) and in the opposite sense.\nIn the utricular otolith organ it was found that the afferent response sensitivity to head acceleration (13, fish) as well as the number of synaptic bodies in hair cells (56, rats) increase as the result of exposure to microgravity (µG). A preliminary result showed that exposure to hyper-G by centrifugation decreases the number of synaptic bodies (56, rats). The period of afferent re-adaptation to normal gravity in fish (13) was found to be close to the period of behavioral adaptation in humans (55). Re-adaptation is defined here as the process of adaptation to normal gravity. These results suggest the possibility that the process of adaptation to µG might be mimicked by the process of re-adaptation from a hyper-G level. However, the experiments that would combine the results of µG and hyper-G experiments for the same species are absent. Further, the correlations of the synaptic re-arrangement with afferent sensitivity following exposure to altered gravity for the same species remain undefined. The purpose of the present proposal is to fill these gaps.\nOur model is the adult toadfish, Opsanus tau. Fish provide an excellent model system for gravitational research (7). We have everything in place to successfully complete the proposed set of experiments and modeling. Of prime importance is the fact that in the same species a comprehensive evaluation of the neural response to µG (13) and hyper-G (present proposal) exposure will be made. There are four specific aims:\nAim 1. Response characteristics of utricular afferents to Centrifugation. Fish will be placed in groups and exposed to different magnitudes (1.5 and 3 g) and duration (1-16 days) of centrifugation. On Center Controls and ground controls are included. Using electrophysiological techniques, individual utricular afferents will be physiologically characterized based on gravitoinertial acceleration testing. Afferent response properties to efferent vestibular activation will be specified.  The duration of afferent recording session is tempered by the need to freeze the tissue in time to permit the measurements of structure-function correlations. To match the conditions under which post-flight experiments were performed (13) changes in afferent sensitivity caused by hyper-G will be studied from 1-24 hrs after centrifugation, and re-adaptation after 24-96 hrs in 1G .\nAim 2. Morphology of hair cell-afferent synaptic complexes. Combining the techniques of labeling of individual afferents with light and transmission electron microscopy a complete characterization of the afferent is possible: its physiology, its dendritic morphology in the macula, and the extent and quantification of synapses formed from the innervated hair cells. Visualization of complex 3-D microcircuitry will also reveal precise connectivity within the macula that is essential for understanding neurovestibular adaptation. Synaptic body counts will be performed to address the fundamental question of the correlation of afferent response sensitivity with hair cell synapse number.\nAim 3. Merging the structure and function of otolith afferents and their relationships to hyper-G. The specific times and thresholds of the afferent response adaptation and re-adaptation and the structural changes associated with the hair cell-afferent synapse will be determined by varying the magnitude and duration of centrifugation.\nAim 4. Modeling. Based on known methodologies and the present experimental results, research will be directed towards the establishment of phenomenological models describing the adaptive changes in utricular afferents in altered gravity conditions. We will examine the relationship between the afferent response and the number of synapses in normal and in hyper-G conditions. A model of toadfish otolith mechanics in these conditions will be also developed.\nThe four specific aims are directed to achieve the main goals: 1) to test the correlations of change in the gravitational level and the change in afferent response characteristics caused by head acceleration and the potential underlying changes in the morphology of the associated hair cell-afferent synaptic complexes, 2) to examine the role of efferent vestibular system on these correlations, 3) to test (propose) the possible mechanisms responsible for these correlations; and 4) to test if the transition from hyper-G to normal gravity can be used to mimic the effects of neural adaptation to µG.\nWe expect that convergence of findings in µG and hyper-G will provide a model of neurovestibular plasticity, and will lead to the development of novel test protocols for both ground- and space-based research. As we learn about the basic cellular processes in vestibular neurons, countermeasures will eventually be developed to reduce the symptoms associated with Space Motion Sickness or even modify synaptic sensitivity in preparation of entry into a higher gravity level.\nThe overarching hypotheses to be evaluated are: One, the gravitoinertial sensitivity of otolith nerve afferents is altered as a consequence of the animal's exposure to hyper-G conditions as well as µG. It is reasoned that the transition from 1G to hyper-G will decrease otolith afferent sensitivity (output in impulses per sec/input in G), and the transition from hyper-G back to 1G will increase it (and back to normal levels). Thus, the transition from hyper-G to normal gravity may serve as an imitator of neurovestibular sequelae to µG. Two, hair cell-afferent synaptic complexes are modified by the altered gravity condition: the up- or down regulation of synaptic bodies is specific to the direction of transition from 1G. The change in number of synapses is directly correlated with afferent response sensitivity. Three, afferent adaptation mechanisms may involve either self-learning processes confined to the hair cell or responses of the hair cell-afferent system to feedback signal(s) that originate from a misbalance of information coming from otolith and extra-otolith contributor(s), or a combination of both. (These mechanisms will be considered by modeling based on the experimental findings.) Four, efferent vestibular actions are not uniform on hair cells and afferents, and it is proposed that the changes brought on in otolith afferents by the transitions from one gravity state to another will be most prevalent and coincident in afferents strongly affected by efferent activation. If this proves to be the case, then the next step is to directly query the efferent neurons themselves.\nThe overall goal of the proposed research is to identify the structural and functional changes that occur in the utricle of the vertebrate vestibular labyrinth as the result of transitions from one gravitational level into another. This information is critical for advancing our understanding of neurovestibular adaptation and its sequelae, and for the effective design and validation of countermeasures to benefit astronaut health and performance. Our strategy is to use centrifugation as a tool for temporarily altering the gravitational stimulus. We are particularly interested in determining the afferent firing rate and response characteristics and the morphological changes in the hair cell-afferent complexes found in the utricle that are modified when the organism moves from normal gravity (1G) to hyper-gravity (hyper-G) and in the opposite sense.  This study is a natural analog to our previous studies aboard STS-90 and 95, and will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the neural response to µG and hyper-G in the same species.\nWe expect that convergence of findings in µG and hyper-G will provide a solid model of neurovestibular plasticity, and will lead to the development of novel test protocols for both ground- and space-based research. As we learn about the basic cellular processes in vestibular neurons, countermeasures will eventually be developed to reduce the symptoms associated with Space Motion Sickness, benefit sensorimotor coordination and performance, or even down regulate synaptic sensitivity in preparation of entry into a higher gravity level.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The functional importance of head stabilization is seen by our ability to change gaze orientation and maintain binocular fixation of objects of interest during not only standing but also during locomotor activities, and our ability to detect self-motion and adaptively react to applied perturbations of the head and body.  In the space environment the vestibular system is profoundly affected by the loss of he gravity vector.  However, conditions on Earth can seriously affect the individual's ability to functional normally.  In addition aging places a serious challenge to the vestibular and neural centers responsible for posture and movement control. Disorders of the vestibular system affect head, gaze and posture stabilization, and can dramatically alter the patients willingness to induce self-motion and can lead to trepidation of normal activities. These studies will also provide important insights into vestibular function, and may help in the diagnosis and treatment of vestibular patients seen in the clinic."

Biology, San Jose State University.\nTask Progress:\nWe have made significant progress towards reaching our stated goals. Two separate and successful centrifugation trials were conducted to examine the response of utricular nerve afferents to 3g and 1.5g hyper-gravity stimulation and the time course of re-adaptation to Earth's 1g following centrifugation. The centrifugation stimulus and configuration have worked perfectly and without incident. Further, we have been able to successfully record the electrophysiological responses of more that 60-70 separate afferents in each experiment, twice what we had anticipated. This increase in sample has provided a very reliable measure to evaluate response between experiments. In addition, we designed a separate rate table to conduct the On-Center Control experiments. This design worked perfectly, allowing the subject to be rotated at 38 rpm in a control aquatic system with stabile water temperature of 12°C.\nAs of October 2008, four (4) fish were studied following 3G exposure at 1, 2, 3, and 8 days; five (5) fish at 4 and 16 days; and three (3) fish at 5, 24, and 32 days (total 32 fish). The 24- and 32-Day groups were added to our protocol based on our results at 16-Day exposure to 3G. For the Re-adaptation experiments, three (3) fish were studied following 4-days of 3G exposure and re-adaptation periods of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days (total 15 fish). In the next group of Re-adaptation experiments, three (3) fish were studied following 16-days of 3G exposure and re-adaptation periods of 2, 6 and 8 days, and four (4) at 4-days of re-adaptation to 1G (total 13 fish). We successfully completed four (4) fish exposed to 1.5G at 4-days and 16-days (total 8 fish). We successfully completed On-Center Control experiments of 38 rpm for 4- and 16-Day with 4 fish in each group.\nResults and conclusions based on the analyses conducted to date on the effect of altered gravity levels on utricular afferent response. Data were collected from 2 orbital shuttle missions: STS-90 and STS-95. Within the first day after landing, the magnitude of response to an applied acceleration was significantly greater than for controls. The number of synaptic bodies in type II hair cells in rodent is labile, increasing following exposure to microgravity, suggesting an increase in synaptic density was responsible for the upregulation of sensitivity. 3-g Centrifugation data. The data must be viewed still as preliminary, because not all data obtained have been analyzed. The mean maximum sensitivity (Smax) of control afferents to a standard translation is 2333 ± 1460 (SD) imp/s/g . The Smax for each group based on days of 3-g exposure is given. A significant elevation at 4-Day and a significant decrease at 16-Day (p<0.0001) of Smax were observed. This is an important finding: the response of the utricle to hypergravity is modifiable and bi-modal. With 4 days of recovery (Re-adaptation) following 3-g exposure for 4- and 16-Days the gain did not return (fall or rise) to control levels. Percent plot shows the wide separation in Smax between 4-Day (red circles) and control fish, and the response of ~80% of afferents in16-Day group (blue diamonds) diverged from control afferents.\nLength of time needed in the 1-g environment following 3-g exposure of 4 and 16 days for afferents to return to baseline levels. Only partial analysis is complete and recovery times of 1, 2, and 6 days have not yet been analyzed. The general conclusion is: the hypersensitivity within the first days of 3-g exposure and the hyposensitivity observed after longer durations of 3-g exposure require at least 4 or more days of return to 1-g to complete the readaptation process. It should be stated again that horizontal canal afferents responded in a normal fashion within each of the experimental groups following 3-g exposure with or without 1-g recovery days and on-center control tests, suggesting that a general labyrinthine mechanism independent of gravity state is unlikely. Quantification of individual synaptic bodies in utricular hair cells in each group is a work in progress.\nFunctional Considerations and General Conclusions: A change in gravity level has a profound effect on how an organism maintains equilibrium, and the neural response might involve the peripheral otolith receptors, the brain or both. In turn, the change of the sensitivity of peripheral otolith receptors in altered G may depend on the change of physical parameters of the otolith structures responsible for transferring the dynamics of head into the dynamics of the hair cell bundle deformations, as well as on the change of properties of local peripheral neural structures, first of all, synapses.\nThe early hypersensitivity was unexpected, and the underlying mechanism is unknown. It is possible that the altered gravity initiates first an upregulation in gain in response to a challenge, any challenge. In this scenario we would expect to observe hypersensitivity in the early stages of µG exposure as well. Regrettably, those data are lacking.\nOne of the hypotheses considered in the project was formulated as follows: ”afferent adaptation mechanisms (unquote, to altered gravity, quote) may involve either self-learning processes confined to the hair cell or responses of the hair cell-afferent system to feedback signal(s) that originate from a misbalance of information coming from otolith and extra-otolith contributor(s), or a combination of both”. The underlying basic assumptions of the feedback hypothesis were provided in the previous report. The experimental findings indicate that sensory plasticity ideed exists in the utricle following exposure to altered gravity conditions. However the mechanisms of neural adaptation in these experiments are still not clear. Theoretical work is in progress, and its progress is dependent on available data. Experimental analysis is still in progress. This analysis includes both the electrophysiological data and synaptic body counts at the transmission electron microscopic level.",

Our objective is to develope an animal model that mimics human bone loss during spaceflight.  The goal is to use such a model to study how unloading affects bone cell function and mass.  We have chosen to work with the mouse because it is small and in other studies has ben shown to mimic the human with respect to aging, and responsiveness to various endocrine factors.  Because there are numerous mouse strains and each behaves differently, we will evaluate three strains.  We will use the hindlimb unloading model to induce skeletal unloading and follow the mice over time.  Bone formation, mass and structure will be assessed.  To determine whether the mouse is a suitable model to study adult human bone loss during spaceflight and recovery after re-ambulation.  It is essential to have an animal model with which to study the loss of bone that occurs with spaceflight.  Without this it is not possible to determine the mechanisms and thus devise means of reducing bone loss and restoring bone after flight.",

            "task_progress": "Our goal was to determine whether the mouse is a suitable model to study adult human bone loss during spaceflight, and to examine the effects of reloading in animals treated with IGF-I.  MicroCT analysis, bone histomorphometry, and cell culture were used to assess bone structure and makeup, bone formation and osteoprogenitor number and osteoclastogenesis.  Over the course of our work we completed the aims of our grant and in addition conducted several other related studies.\nOur study examined two different strains of mice, the DBA and C57B/6 (C57).  Mean body weights did not show any significant difference between hindlimb unload versus control mice at the start of the unloading experiment. Although body weights trended downward at day 7, the difference was not statistically significant and body weights in both strains stabilized after 14 days of suspension, ultimately rebounding to basal (pre-suspension) body weight by day 28 of suspension.  There was no significant difference between control C57 and DBA body weights.\nDBA mice had a lower bone volume than C57 mice.  With unloading both lost bone proportionately.  Micro CT analysis from both strains showed no significant difference in bone fractional volume (BV/TV) at the 1-week timepoint. After 2 weeks of suspension unloaded C57 mice had 30% lower BV/TV than loaded controls, while DBA mice still showed no significant decrease in BV/TV. Hindlimb unload mice of both strains showed a decrease in BV/TV at the 4-week timepoint, with C57 unload mice showing a larger decrease than DBA (35%, p=0.001 and 32%, p=0.039 respectively).  DBA hindlimb unloaded mice experienced no significant change in total bone mineral density with time in suspension, at any of the 1, 2 or 4 week timepoints. C57BL6 hindlimb unloaded mice, in contrast, experienced a 26% decrease with 2 weeks of unloading and a 39% decrease with 4 weeks of unloading. No significant segmented bone mineral density changes were observed, except a 3.5% decrease in the C57BL6 4-week unload group.     \tTrabecular number data indicate no change with unloading in DBA mice at 1, 2 and 4 week timepoints. In C57BL6 mice, however, there is a 10% decrease in trabecular number with 2 weeks of suspension. None of the other timepoints produced any significant changes.  \t  \tIn both strains of mice, trabecular thickness decreased continuously with unloading. With 1 week of unloading, neither mouse strain saw a significant change in Tb.Th, but at the 2-week timepoint, a 10% decrease was observed in both the C57BL6 and the DBA/2 unloaded mice. This decrease continued in the 4-week timepoint with a 21% and 15.7% decrease in the C57 and DBA unloaded mice respectively. Structure model index data reveal a lower SMI in C57 versus DBA, indicating a more plate-like structure in C57 trabeculae (data not shown).  Bone formation at the tibio-fibular junction decreased but did not reach significance.  Bone mineral density both total and segmented (density of the bone mineral alone) decreased in the C57 but not in the DBA.  Osteoprogenitor number decreased initially and then gradually returned to the control level in both strains.  Osteoclastogenesis increased to the same degree in both strains and then gradually returned to normal.  Our data indicate that both strains respond to unloading but with important differences.  In both strains osteoblast formation decreases and osteoclast formation increases.  These changes are consistent with the trend for bone formation to decrease with time of unloading.  That bone mineral density decreased in the C57 but not in the DBA suggests that the response of these two strains are not identical.\nAfter 1 week of skeletal unloading, osteoblast cultures from both mouse strains showed significantly decreased calcium nodule formation when compared to those cultured from 1 week loaded control animals. Osteoblast cultures isolated from 1 week unloaded C57 mice exhibited a 70% decrease in alizerin red (AR) mineralized nodule formation when compared to those isolated from normally loaded control C57 mice. Cultures isolated from DBA mice at this same timepoint showed a 60% decrease. By 2 and 4-week time points, cultures isolated from unloaded animals in both strains, had half as many nodules as normally loaded animals (p=0.001). There was no significant change in nodule formation over time of suspension in unloaded animals, although nodule formation in unloaded animals trended upward with time in suspension.\nOsteoclasts cultured from 1-week unloaded mice showed a two-fold increase in total osteoclast number when compared to those isolated from 1 week normally loaded control animals. Results are nearly identical in both C57 and DBA mice. This difference in total number of osteoclasts was reduced after 2 weeks of suspension, and was nearly non-existent at the 4-week. When osteoclasts in each culture were categorized by size, a more striking result was observed.  The large osteoclast (osteoclasts containing >50 nuclei) numbers revealed the most pronounced difference between load and unload groups at the 1-week time point. At the 1-week time point, osteoclast cell cultures isolated from unloaded C57 mice contained 3.5 times the number of large osteoclasts isolated from normally loaded animals. Osteoclast cell cultures isolated from 1 week suspended DBA mice produced 4 times more large osteoclasts than normally loaded 1 week cultures.  These differences between large osteoclasts in normally loaded versus unloaded groups became indistinguishable after 4 weeks of suspension in both C57 and DBA mouse strains.\nThe changes we observed with unloading in the mouse were very similar to those observed in humans during un-weighting or disuse.  Osteoprogenitor number and bone formation decreased and importantly osteoclast progenitor number and bone resorption increased.  These findings strongly support the use of the mouse as an animal model to study adult human bone loss during space flight.  Interestingly bone resorption increased dramatically in our mice but in previous studies it has been reported that resorption in the rat contributes much less to bone loss during unloading.  Although rats have been used extensively in space flight experimentation, studies have shown that although bone formation is decreased in ground based models, decreased bone formation during space flight is minimal or non-existent of bone.  Resorption in the rat is also difficult to demonstrate in ground based studies.  Thus our findings suggest that the mouse is likely to be a better animal model for human bone during space flight.\nWe also examined the effects of reloading after a period of unloading in animals treated with IGF-I.  Our studies show that reloading increases bone formation and gradually restores bone mass.  The process is, however, slow and complete restoration of bone may never occur.  To determine if we could increase bone recovery and reduce fracture risk, we treated animals with IGF-I during the recovery period.  Our findings suggest that IGF-I treatment speeds bone recovery by stimulating bone formation.  Thus IGF-I administration may be of benefit in restoring bone in astronauts after long duration space missions, and in treating patients following a period of immobilization when such patients are returned to normal weight bearing.",

Through a series of integrative experiments, we seek to uncover similarities between prenatal exposure to increased (or hyper-) gravity and other intrauterine events, such as prenatal nutrients and oxygen  that ‘program’, or set the stage for developmental outcomes and adult disease. The fetal programming hypothesis states that prenatal events set into motion a series of physiological alterations in the developmental program that may translate into adult disorders, in particular, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mental illness. In the current project, Norway rats will be exposed to 2-g or 1.5-g hypergravity to establish continuous centrifugation as a model for fetal programming of adult disease. Non-pregnant females will be adapted to hypergravity prior to mating to eliminate effects of the adaptation process on fetal offspring. We have previously established reduced birth weights of rats exposed to 2-g or 1.5-g centrifugation during prenatal development. We have also observed decreased numbers of labor contractions in dams that underwent pregnancy during 2-g or 1.5-g centrifugation. Behavioral, physiological and molecular methods will be combined to ascertain mechanisms underlying effects of centrifugation on the maternal-fetal system. We will characterize and compare effects of hypergravity on uterine contractile activity during gestation and birth using intrauterine pressure measurement, hormonal and behavioral measures. Studies of fetal offspring at the time of birth will control exposure to uterine contractions by either administering specific numbers of artificially-produced contractions or by completely eliminating exposure to them. Comparisons will be made between offspring that undergo gestation in hypergravity and those exposed to bilateral occlusion of the uterine arteries during late pregnancy, the latter being an established model of fetal programming. Labor contractions will be related to neonatal variables, namely postpartum breathing and oxygenation, suckling and metabolic activity. Molecular analyses will focus on the expression of specific genes that are reactive to sensory simulation, the early, immediate genes, c-fos and c-jun in brain and adrenal of the newborn rats associated with birth. Longitudinal studies of the offspring will focus on adult cardiovascular responses to stress.",

            "task_progress": "In recent years, the numbers of female astronauts in U.S. and international space programs has grown immensely. Women are expected to increase their participation in the NASA missions as the Vision for Space Exploration unfolds. This initiative calls for establishing an extended human presence on the moon and preparing for the Mission to Mars, requiring sustained habitation of the space environment by men and women alike. Within the private sector, there is a growing emphasis on space tourism with flights into low earth orbit and new initiatives for marketing space vacations. These unprecedented opportunities for expanded space exploration and habitation demand that we improve our understanding of both acute and enduring effects of space travel on women and the female reproductive system. It is vital that we identify potential reproductive risks for women astronauts and space tourists of tomorrow, and that we develop some understanding of reproduction in space before the inevitable first space conception transpires. Because there is almost no knowledge base on the effects of the space environment on the female reproductive system, ground-based animal studies comprise important first steps. Allowing female astronauts to serve as the ‘guinea pigs’ for uncovering space-related changes in reproductive physiology and function, particularly for long-duration missions, poses a risky approach to the problem.\nOur productivity provides continuing evidence of our excellent track record for timely and regular dissemination of our findings throughout the scientific community as well as strong media interest. Three invited book chapters on reproduction and space have appeared in edited volumes (Advances in Space Biology and Medicine and Sourcebook of Model Organisms in the Biomedical Sciences). Nineteen empirical papers have appeared in scientific journals and 41 published abstracts were presented at scientific meetings. Our research was prominently featured in 11 invited national and international colloquia given by the PI. The documentary we filmed at NASA Ames Research Center in 2004 entitled ‘Science at the Edge: Breaking Nature’s Rules’ has been nationally and internationally aired on The Discovery Channel since 2005. In this documentary, the PI was interviewed and the importance of these centrifuge experiments was discussed. The PI was interviewed by the History Channel as part of a Universe series segment on ‘Sex in Space’ that aired in December 2008.\nTypically, fertility cycles of female astronauts are suppressed, so there have been no studies of human female reproductive processes under spaceflight conditions. However, environmental conditions are known to exert several adverse effects on the ovaries and on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis that regulates the ovulatory cycle and is highly susceptible to environmental factors. Stress alone can lead to ovulatory failure. Our recent experiments have uncovered adverse effects of altered gravity on critical phases of female reproductive processes related to estrus cycling and conception. These changes occur even when females are adapted to the altered gravity environment for over a week prior to mating. Collectively, our research suggests that extended exposure to 2-g centrifugation constitutes a chronic stressor that exerts acute, and possibly persistent, adverse effects on ovulatory function and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis regulating reproductive function. We have completed the key analyses required to confirm our findings and begin to uncover the underlying mechanisms. Female mammals undergo characteristic hormonal and cellular changes during the reproductive cycle. In rats, the estrous cycle averages 4-5 days in length and consists of four identifiable phases: proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. Numerous environmental factors can interrupt the estrous cycle, such as stress, sterile mating, mechanical stimulation of the cervix, or continuous illumination. It was previously reported that, when centrifugation was initiated during diestrus, the length of the rat’s estrous cycle increased due to prolonged diestrus. Female rats exposed to hindimb unloading to mimic aspects of microgravity exposure showed estrous cycle lengthening due to prolongation of the diestrus phase of the cycle. In this study, we hypothesized that continuous, long-duration (2 mo) exposure to 2-g centrifugation would alter patterns of estrous cycling and delay conception. The NASA Ames Research Center 24-foot Centrifuge was used to produce 2-g. Sexually mature female and male rats weight-matched then assigned to either 2-g centrifuge or non-centrifuge (stationary 1-g control) conditions, and to non-breeding or breeding conditions. In non-breeding females, estrous cycles were analyzed by examining vaginal cytology before and for 35 days during centrifugation. Females in the breeding condition were time-mated following 7 days of adaptation to centrifugation. Following adaptation to centrifugation, both centrifuged and non-centrifuged breeding females conceived, however centrifuged females took four-times longer than controls to achieve conception. Our results indicate that conception in 2-g adapted female rats was significantly delayed and resulted in overall diminished pregnancy outcomes.\nBirth during centrifugation, even at modest g-loads of 1.5- to 2.0-g, is associated with increased rates of infant mortality, up to 60% mortality at 2.0-g. As a developmental biologist with expertise in studies of mammalian development, it was clear to the PI that existing paradigms for studying prenatal and neonatal development in centrifugation were lacking. Therefore, it was necessary for us to establish a feasible paradigm for centrifugation studies of pregnant rat dams and litters that would yield clear, non-confounded experimental data on live offspring that would be suitable for both ground-based and space platforms using ISS centrifuge. To facilitate comparisons with existing flight data, we exposed pregnant rats to centrifugation beginning on G11 of the rats 22-day gestation period, the timetable followed for the NIH.R2 spaceflight experiment. We selected a modest gravity level of 1.5-g tha enabled us to maximize neonatal survival while observing centrifugation effects on neonates. Comparisons were made among Centrifugation-exposed (HG), Stationary Yoked Control (SYC), Rotational Control (RC) and Vivarium (VIV) groups with dams weight-matched across conditions. We outfitted the centrifuge with high-resolution CCD cameras to allow for collection of behavioral data and monitoring of the dams and offspring during centrifugation. We applied conventional statistical procedures for developmental studies in which each litter is considered to be a single unit. Briefly, multiple offspring from the same dam do not represent repeated, independent observations because the littermates share in common a dam, a genetic substrate, and a host of environmental variables that are not shared with offspring from another litter. Since littermates are non-independent observations, offspring from a given dam represent only one observation. In addition, we anticipated some neonatal mortality, therefore it was important to control for litter size across the HG and SYC conditions. We did this by matching size and composition of the SYC litters to HG litters on a daily basis. The RC and VIV groups remained undisturbed throughout the study, the latter providing a control for shrinking litter size in the HG group. This paradigm has yielded important advances in the quality and interpretability of the data that we can derive from animals developing during centrifugation. Following centrifugation onset, HG dams showed an immediate decline in body mass. Food intake and water intake (per 100gm dam body mass) were reduced in HG relative to SYC dams during the first three days of centrifugation but not thereafter. Behavioral activity of the HG and SYC dams encoded from timelapse video (12:1 tape:playback ratio) revealed that HG dams were consistently less active than SYC dams until late in gestation. Non-pregnant animals show a similar pattern of adaptation coupled with increases in corticosterone (CORT) that persist for only four to six days following the onset of centrifugation.\nTo ascertain the role of maternal reproductive experience in neonatal mortality in centrifugation, compared mothers of differing parities. Primigravid (first pregnancy) and bigravid (second pregnancy) female rats were exposed to 1.5-g centrifugation from G11 throughout birth and the first postnatal week. On the day of birth, litter sizes were identical across gravity and parity conditions although significantly fewer live neonates were observed among centrifugation-reared litters born to primigravid dams as compared to bigravid dams (82% and 94%, respectively; 1.0-g controls, 99%). Birth weights of the centrifugation-reared neonates were significantly less than those of controls (SYC, 6.9 +/- 0.4 gm; HG, 6.0 +/- 0.6 gm). Fetal mortality did not differ across gravity conditions, however disruption of pup-directed maternal care was highly correlated with neonatal mortality (R2 = 0.99, p < 0.02). Prior pregnancy and birth can ameliorate neonatal losses in centrifugation during the first 24 hrs after birth. In light of the known linkage between birth weight and adult disease, one of the most striking observations of this study is that, whereas the body weights of bigravid and primigravid dams exposed to centrifugation were vastly different one another (Primigravid, 252.1 +/- 11.4 gm; Bigravid, 302.4 +/- 22.6 gm) birth weights of the offspring did not differ across parity conditions.\nIn a separate study, we exposed rat dams to continuous centrifugation (20 RPM) at one of three g-loads (1.5, 1.75, or 2.0-g) from G11 until birth. Comparisons were made with Rotational Control (1.03-g) and Stationary Control (1.0-g) conditions. Pup body weights in each gravity condition differed from every other gravity condition. Although birth weights of neonates in the RC condition were suppressed relative to those in the SC condition, possibly due to the stress of centrifugation or changes in uterine blood flow at different g-loads, increased gravity resulted in greater decreases in birth weight. Together these findings indicate that centrifugation exposure during the latter half of gestation is associated with reduced birth weight. This outcome is independent of maternal body weight, age and parity.\nWe have a long-standing interest in the adaptive effects of labor contractions in the newborn. Labor in mammals facilitates the transition from fetus to newborn. In response to the stress of powerful contractions, the fetus secretes copious amounts of adrenaline and noradrenaline from adrenal and extra-adrenal tissues. Catecholamine release assists the neonate’s survival outside of the womb by affording protection against hypoxia and exerts a number of positive effects on respiratory variables, including lung liquid absorption, surfactant release, and increased lung compliance. There also exists a positive relationship between vaginal birth and neonatal outcome. Vaginal delivery, relative to elective cesarean birth, is associated with increased neonatal metabolic rate, enhanced blood flow to vital organs and improved neurodevelopmental status. We have been able to analyze neonatal adaptation to the extrauterine environment using a unique procedure we devised to 'build' a birth. Using this technique, we can apply the major components of birth to fetal rats at term and otherwise perform a cesarean delivery. These components are: 1) Compression to simulate labor contractions, 2) Umbilical cord occlusion, 3) Cooling from intrauterine temperature (37.5 deg C) to room temperature (21 deg C), and 4) Stroking to mimic postpartum licking by the dam. In a series of studies in which we have applied these birth components singly and in combination, we have found that simulated labor contractions are essential for the maintenance of breathing at birth; without contractions or some form of physical stimulation, the infants will not survive.  We have recently observed decreases in pH, pO2, and oxygen saturation in animals deprived of labor contractions. We have also shown that labor contractions also facilitate the onset of suckling at birth. These changes in rats, like humans, are associated with catecholamine release. There is known to be widespread neural expression of the immediate early gene, c-fos in newborn mice. We have hypothesized that the brain is 'turned on' at birth by labor contractions and have measured c-fos expression throughout the brain (with special attention to the locus coeruleus and other areas involved in arousal) in rats exposed to and deprived of labor contractions.\nIn the NASA NIH.R2 spaceflight mission, pregnant rats were flown on the Space Shuttle for 9 days beginning on Gestational day (G) 11 of their 22-day pregnancy until G20, approximately 48 to 72 hrs prior to birth. The NIH.R2 dams successfully completed their pregnancies although twice as many labor contractions were observed in the Flight dams relative to ground controls. These results replicated our findings from NIH.R1 in which pregnant dams were launched on G11 and landed on G20 of gestation. We repeated the NIH.R2 study in the 1.5-g centrifugation environment.\nThese findings have led us to hypothesize that a given amount of intrauterine force is required to expel the fetuses from the womb during parturition. Following exposure to hypogravity, more contractions may be needed to complete parturition because each contraction is less forceful than normal. This observation is supported by the finding that connexin-43 (but not connexin-26) proteins were decreased in the myometrium of spaceflight dams. Connexin-43 is a key step in the proliferation of gap junctions that participate in uterine contractions during labor. In the present application, we will consider the role of oxytocin as well as connexin proteins as a mechanism for centrifugation-induced changes in uterine contractility. We have utilized a telemetric device for measuring IUP. This technique enabled us to make precise measurements of intrauterine pressure in behaving dams and thereby ascertain the force of contractions in altered gravity. Importantly, the wireless sensor will be suitable for making IUP measurements in freely moving pregnant rats onboard future spaceflight vehicles or the ISS In view of the pervasive effects of labor contractions on the newborn's adaptation to life outside of the womb, and the effects of altered gravity on uterine contractions, we hypothesized that uterine activity is one component of fetal programming. Our results support this hypothesis.        The third major aim of our work is to further our understanding of altered gravity as a chronic stressor in females. Stress induced by altered gravity may underlie delayed conception. Previously, our work has incorporated a contemporary perspective in maternal-fetal medicine: ‘Intrauterine programming’ is revealing astounding insights into the prenatal origins of adult disease arising from environmental factors. Adult disease states that have been implicated include metabolic, endocrine, and cardiovascular pathophysiologies. Importantly, our results indicate that 2-g centrifugation beginning prior to conception leads to reduced body weights of neonatal offspring, increased body weights and hormonal alterations in adulthood even when animals are reared at 1-g. These findings are helping to establish 2-g centrifugation as a unique model for chronic stress that induces programming effects on progeny reared at 1-g. Mere exposure of the female reproductive system (prior to conception) may be sufficient to induce persistent changes in the health and well-being of offspring. Additional hormonal and neural studies are needed to clarify effects of altered gravity as a chronic stressor, including both acute and persistent effects on the female reproductive system, and to identify meaningful countermeasures for use in female astronauts. These concerns are vital to our future space endeavors.\nIn summary, our work has provided important analyses of altered gravity effects on reproductive physiology of the female mammal and influences on developing offspring. The Vision for Space Exploration calls for conducting space biology studies on the astronauts themselves in future flights rather than relying on animal models to ascertain the physiological consequences of space travel. However is it vital that we understand in advance of long-term habitation of space by female astronauts the requisite changes in reproductive function, whether these changes persist after return to Earth, and mechanisms of cross-generational transmission. Collectively, these animal studies are vital to understanding the experience of astronauts during long-duration missions and persistent effects of spaceflight on reproductive processes, including how altered gravity affects female reproductive processes and the specific underlying mechanisms. Continuing attention to these types of animal studies is sorely needed for developing meaningful countermeasures for female astronauts that undertake long-duration missions into space, and for understanding potential consequences of reproduction in space.",

            "task_description": "The opportunity to fly bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice in space flight would allow the Chapes lab to test hypotheses related to those proposed in the original Bonemac project (NAG2-1274) which was cancelled before completion. The Bonemac project was not completed because of hardware considerations, the Columbia space shuttle accident, and NASA’s change in priorities. The ULF-2 mission on STS-126 will provide the opportunity to test the hypothesis that the expression of the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (c-fms) or the expression of c-fos on bone marrow cells differentiating in the presence of macrophage stimulating factor (CSF-1) while those cells are flown in space. This will assess the mechanism of how space flight affects the differentiation of those bone marrow cells into macrophages by determining if these critical elements are altered in the cells as they differentiate.\nThe study will also complement recently completed experiments that were part of the CBTM-2 payload that flew on STS-118. We discovered that there were significant impacts on cells differentiating in the granulocytic lineage, including macrophages. Therefore, STS-118 provided additional evidence that space flight affects hematopoiesis of cells in the granulocytic lineage, including macrophages. Although the ULF2 mission will fly isolated bone marrow ex vivo, it will allow us to assess the effects of space flight on bone marrow cells directly. It will provide the opportunity to determine at what critical stage the macrophage differentiation process is disrupted. By measuring key changes in gene expression and cell surface phenotypes of cells as they differentiate we will be able to determine where the process is affected. We will assess macrophage differentiation at three different time points during the flight. In particular, we will do temporal comparisons of the expression of several different cell surface markers which distinguish phenotypically distinct subsets in the bone marrow as well as mature and immature macrophages, neutrophils, and other cells. After the STS-126 flight, cells will be recovered, probed with antibody, and analyzed using flow cytometric techniques. Some cells will be preserved in RNA-Later. These cells will be recovered, treated with Trizol, and RNA will be used in an expression analysis of various signaling genes involved in the differentiation responses. Some samples will not be fixed and will be used to assess cell viability and the supernatants will be analyzed for cytokines.\nThese studies will help identify how the human body adapts to space flight and identify countermeasures to these changes.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Space flight offers a unique environment that impacts many physiological systems. Amongst these systems, bone metabolism is known to be significantly altered by the skeletal unloading of space flight. Hematopoiesis is the process which provides the body with mature, functioning cells necessary for oxygenation, clotting and immune functions. The bone, specifically, the bone marrow, is the site for hematopoiesis.  Moreover, changes in bone impact all compartments therein, including the marrow. Indeed, analysis of animals from rats to rhesus moneky to humans shows that hematopoiesis can be affected by space flight. Although direct examination of  primary hematopoiesis is not an aim of the proposed project, this experiment will allow us to dissect a very complex system. We will obtain valuable information about what mechanisms involved in hematopoiesis are susceptible to disruption by space flight. This understanding will allow for more effective countermeasure planning. On Earth, skeletal unloading occurs to individuals that are bedridden for long periods of time, wheel-chair bound, or lose the ability to stand for long periods of time. These prolonged periods of skeletal unloading also induce changes in bone that parallel those seen in space flight. In addition, individuals with bone disorders, such as osteoporosis, are also subject to alterations in hematopoiesis. This is best exemplified by the osteopetrotic mouse, which has diminished numbers of macrophages and brittle bones. Therefore, data obtained from this study will also have direct extrapolations to individuals on Earth."

            "task_progress": "On November 14, 2008, the BoneMac experiment was launched on STS-126/ULF2 (Endeavour).  The experiment was conducted on the Middeck. All in-flight experiment operations were completed per schedule.  Endeavour returned to Earth on November 20, 2008, with the landing occurring at the Edwards Air Force Base alternate landing site. The BoneMac specimens were flown to Kennedy Space Center Space Life Sciences (SLS) Lab via a commercial flight that departed from Los Angeles on the Orbiter landing date.  The total mission duration was 15 days.\nThe goal of this flight research experiment was to determine how macrophage differentiation is suppressed in the space flight environment.  The specimen used for this study were primary murine (mouse) bone marrow cells.  The specific objectives were as follows:\n•\tTest that hypothesis progenitor macrophage differentiation is disrupted by CSF-1 receptor expression down regulation .\n•\tAssess the differentiation mechanism by measuring how space flight affects the differentiation of bone marrow cells into macrophages by cell phenotying, assessing mRNA expression, and assessing cytokine production by the bone marrow cells during macrophage progenitor cell differentiation.\n•\tAnalyze changes in cell surface phenotypes and gene expression during differentiation to identify where the differentiation process is affected by the space flight environment.\nPrimary murine bone marrow cells from adult C57BL/6J mice were used for this experiment.  The bone marrow cells were collected from the humeri, femora, and tibiae. The collected cells were suspended in growth medium that was supplemented with macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1).  The cells were loaded into the primary chamber of 48 FPAs.  In 32 FPAs, formalin was loaded into the secondary chamber.  Eight FPAs were loaded with 6.0 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) in the secondary chamber, and, 8 FPAs were loaded with growth medium plus CSF-1 (nonpreserved) in the secondary chamber.  A total of 6 GAPs were loaded with 8 FPAs each.  After loading, the cells were placed into the CGBA (37 oC) to start incubation, pre-launch.  After launch, BoneMac GAP crew operations were conducted on two dates.   One set of GAPs were operated on FD6, and a second set of GAPs were operated on FD15.  This timeline allowed for obtaining bone marrow cells that were allowed to differentiate for different time durations. Post-flight, the FPAs were returned to the KSU laboratory for processing and analyses.\nA ground control was run at SLS Lab using FPAs, GAPs, and a CGBA.  This ground control followed the same protocols and timeline as the flight samples.\nWe determined that the nonpreserved (kept in medium) set had more cells in the flight FPAs (n=7; 3.0±0.6 x 107; mean±Sd) compared to the ground (n=4; 1.7±0.4 x 107; P<0.01, t-test; mean±Sd).  We have also found there were more cells in the formalin-fixed flight FPAs 5.3±0.6; n=28; mean±Sd) compared to the ground (4.4±0.6 x 106; n=32; mean±Sd; P<0.01, t-test).  The increase in cell number from the time the cells were fixed on Day 14 of flight to landing and recovery on Day 17 suggests that the cells were viable at the time of fixation.  Therefore, there appears to be more proliferation in space than on the ground with flight cell numbers increasing 5.66 fold and ground cell numbers increasing 3.86 fold from day 14 to day 17.  We also measured glucose utilization by the cells in the unfixed FPA’s.  We found a significantly less glucose usage by flight cells (121±4 mg/dl) compared to cells grown on the ground (159±3 mg/dl).  These data suggest that the cells required less energy to proliferate more in space.\nWe found a significant increase in the overall expression of Mac2+,c-fms+ cells and Mac2+, c-fos+ cells differentiated in space compared to ground controls and a significant change in the distribution of cells that were double positive for Mac2 and c-fms and c-fos between the two treatment groups (P<0.05, chi 2 analysis).  However, we did not see a change in distribution in the expression of  F4/80+,CD44+ cells, F4/80+,Ly6C+ cells or F4/80+,Gr1+ cells.  The increased level of expression of F4/80 and Mac2 and the decreased expression of Ly6C suggests that space flight may be increasing driving cells toward being more differentiated.  The increased expression of c-fms, especially in the populations that would be particularly rich in differentiated macrophages  would be consistent with the idea that binding more macrophage colony stimulating factor may drive the cells to become more differentiated.  We also reject the hypothesis that space flight decreases the expression of c-fms, the receptor for CSF-1.  In contrast, it appears to increase its expression, especially on the Mac2+, c-fms+ cell populations\nBy 15 days of flight the cells in the FPA should have been differentiated into the macrophage lineage.  For flight samples, we found that 209 genes had gene transcript levels >1.5 fold higher than ground controls.  In contrast, we found that 644 genes had gene transcript levels >1.5 fold lower than ground controls.  The genes were broadly categorized into 16 broad categories based on function.  These included: Genes involved in carbohydrate synthesis, cell division, cytokine/hormone function, cytokine/hormone receptor, hematopoiesis, host defense, lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, nucleotide synthesis, signal transduction, structural protein, transcription, translation, transport, Energy or metabolic processes, Development, or protein function.  Genes of unknown function 291 genes of unknown function were also identified.  Although the analysis of this array will continue to be mined, the data obtained show that this part of the experiment was successful.",

This issue is especially important given reports that the crew's immune system is dysfunctional during flight, and our recent discovery that spaceflight increased the disease-causing potential and globally altered the gene expression of the human food-borne pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Our research also showed that many of the observed changes in Salmonella were associated with specific proteins in the cells, called RNA binding proteins, that bind to and regulate genetic material within the cell to control cellular characteristics in response to stress. In addition, our studies during spaceflight and using ground-based, spaceflight analogue culture systems have shown that increasing the concentration of certain ionic salts, like phosphates, in the growth media can prevent the increased disease causing potential observed for Salmonella during spaceflight. Interestingly, human cells also contain evolutionarily conserved RNA binding proteins that are very similar in structure and function to those found in bacteria. In human cells, these RNA binding proteins are critical for the cells proper function, including supporting a healthy immune system, maintaining tissue differentiation, and responding to cellular stress. We hypothesize that RNA binding regulatory proteins and their small RNA binding counterparts are key to a conserved, common cellular spaceflight response mechanism in both bacterial and human cells and that this response can be manipulated by environmental salt/ion levels. The implications of a universally conserved molecular response to spaceflight would affect NASA's approach to infectious disease risk assessment, development of biological processing systems for exploration, and changes in biodegradation during a mission. Indeed, if these responses are also observed in human cells, they may translate into knowledge of both the astronaut's response to infection and possibly larger physiological responses that are influenced by cellular changes.",

            "task_progress": "I) We have identified common evolutionarily conserved spaceflight and spaceflight analogue-induced mechanisms that are conserved across different cell types and which alter their cellular characteristics and phenotypes. Specifically, we have shown that Hfq is an evolutionarily conserved central regulator of the microbial response to both spaceflight and spaceflight analogue culture in both Gram negative (Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) pathogens.  Thus, Hfq represents the first spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue induced regulator acting across bacterial species.  In addition, we have also shown that these culture environments regulate the virulence and/or pathogenesis related phenotypes of these same organisms in novel ways that are not observed when they are cultured under conventional conditions.\nII) A NASA-funded flight experiment on STS-131, operationally called STL-IMMUNE, was awarded as a part of this ground-based flight analogue research. The objectives of this flight experiment were directly related to and complemented our ground-based work (including use of the same cell types), the goal of which is to identify universally conserved molecular responses to ground-based spaceflight analogue culture across a variety of bacterial and mammalian cell types.  Specifically, the focus of STL-IMMUNE was to 1) understand the effect of microgravity on the host-pathogen interaction and infection process from the perspective of the human cell, and 2) understand the effect of microgravity alone on human cellular responses that are relevant to normal cellular homeostasis or transition to disease. STL-IMMUNE was the first space biology experiment to conduct an in-flight infection of human cells.\nWe have now finalized sample analysis for global alterations in both transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, cellular differentiation, immune function (inflammatory response mediators), and stress responses associated with spaceflight in the presence and absence of infection.  All flight sample comparisons were made to identical synchronous ground controls housed in duplicate CCM hardware as that used for flight. Through iTRAQ analysis, we have identified 86 total unique human proteins (95% confidence, 1% FDR) that were expressed by the HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells cultured on orbit either before or after infection with Salmonella Typhimurium. These proteins belonged to a range of different functional classes and categories, including those important for metabolism, apoptosis, cell communication, immune function, and others. Of the 89 proteins identified, a unique subset of these were found to be differentially regulated in response to spaceflight, and showed differences in response to infection between flight and ground cultures. Collectively, we found intriguing differences in how microgravity uniquely impacted the spaceflight infected intestinal cells as compared to the ground controls.  We have also finalized global proteomic response profiling for the A549 lung epithelial cells as well.  Moreover, immunohistochemical profiling has revealed differences in both distribution and expression patterns of targeted host cell proteins and alterations in cellular cytoarchitecture.

In order to learn more of the pathways activated by the force of gravity, we have isolated a series of Drosophila mutants that have altered behavioral responses to gravity. These and other Drosophila mutants will be used to explore the signaling pathways underlying one the most marked changes associated with exposure to microgravity - loss of muscle tissue. Specifically the studies will address the issue of whether mechanosensory neurons and associated central brain circuitry regulate muscles responses to altered gravitational force. A powerful technique has been developed within Drosophila that allows conditional inactivation of targeted neurons. This technique will be used to inactivate the neurons under study and to determine whether this loss of neural input alters the responses of the muscles to hypergravity. Quantitative PCR will be used to examine muscle responses. A selection of genes indicated by other studies to show altered expression in response to altered gravitational force will be examined.\nThese studies should provide unique information on the regulation of muscle metabolism in response to changes in gravity. NRA NNH08ZTT003N seeks to identify studies aimed at understanding signaling pathways associated with mechanoperception. The studies  proposed are focused directly upon this goal. NASA has programmatic interest in understanding the adaptation of living things to change in gravitational force. The studies presented will provide significant insight into these adaptive processes.

            "task_progress": "Muscles are highly responsive to mechanical load. Muscles that are heavily used undergo growth whereas muscles that are not subjected to mechanical work atrophy and become weak. Degeneration of the muscles is thus a common problem for astronauts under the low gravitational force experienced in space. A major question concerning these observations is – how do the muscles sense their mechanical load and how do they respond to it? One hypothesis is that neurons within the muscles specialized to sense the force exerted on the muscles somehow provide feedback to the muscles initiating either growth or atrophy. The research performed under this project was aimed at investigating this possible relationship between mechanosensory neurons and muscle metabolism.\nThe experiments were performed in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, a small fruit fly. This organism has been studied intensively for about 100 years and as a result, many research tools are available for studies of muscle function in this organism that have not been generated for other animal species. The project grew out of our previous work to identify genes that contribute to responses to gravitational force. During the course of this funding, we have pursued molecular and behavioral studies of two of these genes, which we have named yuri gagarin (yuri) and jim lovell (lov) in honor of our NASA funding and two heroic space pioneers.\nWe have established that the yuri gene encodes a protein that interacts with a key component of the muscle contraction apparatus. This protein, termed Tropomyosin, has a major role in stabilizing one of the rod-like structures in muscles that move during the contraction process. Using a specialized technique termed TAP-tagging, we have shown that the protein encoded by Yuri binds directly to the Tropomyosin protein (see publication Texada et al., 2011, in below Bibliography). Given that we know that mutations to the yuri gene affect locomotor responses to gravity (1), these findings suggest that yuri expression may be regulated by mechanosensory neurons. Our surprising finding that yuri is required for attachment of the centriole (basal body) to the spermatid nucleus (see publication Kracklauer et al., 2010, in below Bibliography), also suggests an alternative route whereby yuri may influence gravitational responses. All mechanosensory neurons in Drosophila have cilia that grow out of a modified centriole and are essential for the mechanosensory signal transduction. Thus it is possible that yuri is a component of the centriole/cilia complex in these neurons and may act in gravitational sensing at the level of the neuron.        The second gene studied during this funding period (lov) has characteristics that suggest it also acts in mechanosensory neurons, specifically a particular class termed chordotonal neurons. lov encodes a neural specific transcription factor of the BTB-POZ domain family and we have established that Lov protein is expressed in a subset of chordotonal neurons associated with muscles involved in locomotion.\nGiven this association of the Lov-expressing neurons with locomotion, we set out to determine whether the Lov neurons actually control muscle activity. To investigate this possibility, we used one of the tools especially developed in Drosophila melanogaster. This is a genetic method that allowed us to express Lov in cell types that do not normally express the protein. The actual experiments performed involved expressing Lov in chordotonal neurons that do not normally express Lov, the rationale being that if Lov controls muscle activity and thus helps produce coordinated muscle movement by being expressed in particular chordotonal neurons, locomotion should be disrupted in some way if Lov is expressed in different chordotonal neurons.\nInitially we chose to apply this approach during the larval stage of development since the nervous system is much better understood during this period. Strikingly, when Lov is misexpressed in this way, the coordinated muscle movements of the larvae are dramatically affected. The larvae develop from embryos in eggshells prepared by their mothers. At the end of embryonic development the newly formed larva must perform a particular series of muscle movements in order to hatch from the eggshell. The larvae with misdirected expression of Lov are incapable of performing these muscle movements. The hatched larvae move by a “caterpillar like” locomotion that involves highly controlled waves of contraction along the body from the back to the front. When the Lov misexpressing larvae are physically removed from their eggshells and set on a smooth surface they fail to generate these coordinated waves of contraction and cannot move from any position in which they are placed. Ultimately the larvae starve since they are also incapable of the movements needed for feeding.\nWe have also misexpressed Lov during the adult stage of Drosophila development. The adults form in pupal cases generated by the larvae at the end of larval development. When Lov is misexpressed so as to affect adult locomotor neurons, most adults are incapable of eclosing from their pupal cases, again because of failure to make the necessary coordinated movements. If helped from their pupal cases, the adults are highly uncoordinated, falling frequently, failing to fly and dying rapidly due to an inability to forage effectively for food.\nAll of these findings suggest the neurons expressing Lov protein have major roles in coordinating locomotion. Other studies have indicated that much of this coordination is executed by the neurotransmitter octopamine (the invertebrate equivalent of nor-adrenalin) (2). An exciting recent finding is the discovery that lov regulates the production of octopamine, presumably by effecting the terminal differentiation of octopaminergic neurons. Future studies are aimed at investigating the connection between lov and bioamine producing neurons in more detail.\nREFERENCES\n1.      Armstrong, J. D., Texada, M. J., Munjaal, R.V. Baker, D.

            "task_description": "Skeletal muscle mass is maintained by a dynamic equilibrium between signals driving muscle growth and muscle atrophy. Protection against loss of muscle mass in anti-gravity requires enhancement of pro-growth signals to counter the drive toward atrophy. The muscle membrane harbors two protein complexes - the focal adhesion complex and the dystrophin glycoprotein complex – that are important for sensing stress at the membrane, and are thought to help coordinate the balance between growth and atrophy. Whether these complexes mediate identical, complementary, or divergent mechanical signals has been difficult to ascertain, yet both appear to be important for promoting muscle cell survival and muscle growth. Identifying the specific pathways utilized by these mechano-sensors is critical to the development of strategies to maintain muscle mass even in the absence of environmental cues for growth. We will employ an in vitro system to map out the signal transduction pathways triggered by mechanical stress via the focal adhesion and dystrophin glycoprotein complexes, the resultant changes in gene expression, and muscle cell survival. Specific inhibition of each complex will be achieved through isolation of muscle cells from mice lacking members of each complex. These studies will establish a mechanistic understanding of the mechanical responses through each membrane complex, and provide the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent muscle atrophy in space.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Sensing load is a part of daily maintenance of  muscle mass and strength, which is affected in anti-gravity, where there is no load on the muscle, but can also be affected in individuals subjected to bed rest, wheelchairs, or casts due to fractures. Understanding how the load sensing mechanisms work can lead to strategies which stimulate the load sensors in the absence of load, and provide a way to maintain muscle mass even when the endogenous signals drive atrophy.\nA second impact of our specific testing will be in the genetic diseases of muscle, namely the muscular dystrophies. We have confirmed that the sarcoglycan complex is required for generating appropriate load sensing, and so when genetic mutations lead to its loss, the load signals are blunted, and then muscles lose mass. While the most straight froward way to combat these mutations is to replace the mutated gene product, we believe this work will lead to novel treatment strategies for many types of muscular dystrophy."

            "task_progress": "The goals of this project are to understand the contribution of a protein complex in muscle cell membranes to sensing load. Using cultured cells from muscle of mice that lack specific members of this protein complex, called the sarcoglycan complex, enables us to test if the complex was important for normal load signaling. First, we grew muscle cells from the mice on flexible membranes so that we could stretch the cells after they matured, and thereby change dynamic load. We found that there were changes in the normal signaling pattern, not only at rest, but also in response to stretch when the sarcoglycan complex was missing. In short, it appeared that the muscles from the normal cells had a transient signaling response in all pathways we measured after a period of stretch. However, the cells lacking the complex had no increased responses in the classical load signaling pathways, but also had heightened responses in the pathways directly coupled to protein synthesis. We conclude that the sarcoglycan complex is a central component of load sensing in muscle.\nNext we examined changes in gene expression in the two cultures. We found that the absence of the sarcoglycan complex caused increased expression of genes in the “atrogene” pathway, as well as increased expression of IGF-I.  Thus, these cultures appear to drive both growth and atrophy pathways when the sarcoglycan complex is absent. At this point, we do not know if these changes result in changes at the protein level, or which pathway ultimately controls the state of the muscle growth. The responses did not change dramatically after a short stretching period, so longer stretching protocol will be used to determine if they evoke more dramatic changes in gene expression.\nFinally, we were given the opportunity to dissect muscles from mice subjected to anti-gravity and age and sex matched ground controls on the last space shuttle mission, STS-135. These will be used to extend our understanding of how the sarcoglycan complex is modified by lack of load, including localization and post-translational modifications (phosphorylation). We obtained tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, and masseter muscles from these mice. While much has been achieve in previous shuttle missions with mouse samples, the sarcoglycan complex involvement has not been addressed. From related projects, we have reported that there are clear differences between the masseters and TA muscles in terms of loading signals and expression differences. We hypothesize that the loading of masseter muscles comes in part from normal chewing activity, and so the mouse masseters may be spared from atrophy. However, this remains to be tested.",

Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. When completed, this study will yield critical insight into how mechanosensitive channels sense and respond to membrane tension.\nProgress:  Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels that directly transduce mechanical stimuli are thought to underlie diverse physiological functions such as the senses of touch, hearing, proprioception, gravity sensing, and osmoregulation. Although the molecular entities of most eukaryotic MS channels still remain elusive, their bacterial counterparts have been extensively studied and thus serve today as paradigms for MS channels. Hence, we use these channels to study the mechanisms of how mechanosensors sense and interact with their lipid environment. This study has allowed us to determine some of the dynamics of these interactions upon channel stimulation and opening.\nThe mechanosensitive channels of large conductance, MscL, and of smaller conductance, MscS, are the two major MS channels in bacteria. They effect a coordinated response to hypo-osmotic shock, serving as emergency release valves for the rapid flux of fluid and solutes. MscL from E. coli was the first to be identified, and is perhaps the best studied mechanosensor from any species. A crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis MscL has been solved, revealing a pentameric structure in a nearly-closed pore of about 4 Å. An extremely large conformational change of this protein must occur to achieve the open pore size of 30 Å estimated by conductance (the amount of ions that pass through the pore in a unit of time) and by molecular sieving experiments. Several models of the gating of MscL have been proposed to explain the drastic structural rearrangements to transition from the closed to open states. Although the models differ in details, all agree that a thinning of the channel in the plane of the membrane, accompanied by the tilting of the transmembrane domains, are necessary to allow the pentamer to achieve an open pore structure. Both of these arrangements require dynamic interactions between regions of the protein and lipids.\nSince X-ray crystallography of integral membrane proteins typically provide little information on their interactions with the surrounding lipids, other techniques have been used to address this issue for MscL. Utilizing some of these approaches, the second transmembrane span (TM2) of E. coli MscL, which faces the lipid membrane, has been defined. Five amino acids after the predicted end of TM2 there is a cluster of charged residues (RKKEE), which appear to be important for channel function; one E. coli MscL study showed that a C-terminal deletion at this point leads to non-functional channels, while another suggested that it serves as a pH sensor by changing the conformation of the region, and it was also suggested to interact with anionic phospholipids. Interestingly, analogous structures with a series of charged amino acids distal to the cytoplasmic transmembrane helix has been noted in other MS channel families. Hence, this region, just cytoplasmic of TM2, is a prime candidate to be involved in the dynamic lipid-protein interactions that occur during MscL gating.\nThe project was basically to utilize an in vivo screen approach to determine areas that may be dynamic within the membrane. Basically, we utilized a library of individual cysteine mutations throughout the protein. Cysteine is unique in that it is reactive to sulfhydryl reagents. Thus, you can post-translationally modify any residue. Here we used modifiers that made the region more hydrophobic, i.e. wanting to go into the membrane. The assumption is that certain regions will normally go into the membrane upon activation of sensor; by forcing this region into the membrane, we may artificially cause the channel to be activated. We know from several other experiments that if this occurs in a living cell, it causes the cell to be less viable or die. Therefore, we can use this as a screen. The modifying reagents we used are: DMTS, which adds a fatty acid chain and would be very aggressive in burying the region within the membrane; MTSBn, which adds what equates to a phenylalanine to the site; and 4-HB-MTS, which is the same as previous but contains a polar hydroxyl group, thus adding what equates to a tyrosine.\nIn the prior years, we screened the available cysteine mutants, and generated additional cysteine mutants. In the last year, we finished the screening of the newly generated cysteine mutants, evaluated the data from the entire screen, and performed secondary screens on the “hits” that allow us to determine if the modifications lead to an overactive (gain-of-function; GOF) or dysfunctional (loss-of-function; LOF) sensor.\nIn the past year we have acknowledged NASA funding in three publications, have two more in press, and have a manuscript in preparation. One of the in press manuscripts is a minireview in the Biophysical Journal entitled “Sensing and responding to membrane tension: the bacterial MscL channel as a model system”. NASA funding is acknowledged, and some of the data from this project figures prominently within the review.\nThe data have provided a glimpse at how a mechanosensor dynamically interacts with the lipid membrane. Notably, the results of this project led to the finding that one residue appears to enter the lipid membrane in a piston-like manner upon sensor activation.",

Biofilms can cause serious diseases, but are also superior at beneficial processes, e.g., nutrient recycling and life support systems required for space exploration. We have developed Earth-based bioreactors for cultivating bacterial biofilms under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), which resembles microgravity of space. LSMMG-grown biofilms exhibit greater resistance than their Earth gravity (NG)-grown counterparts, making them even a greater threat to astronaut health during space travel/residence. This increased resistance encompasses both ‘disinfectants’ (e.g., ethanol) as well as antibiotics, and resembles the general stress response (GSR) of bacteria on Earth. The resemblance between LSMMG-conferred resistance and the GSR includes the facts that both make bacteria resistant to killing agents that destroy them by different mechanisms, and that both appear to depend on common regulatory elements, e.g., sigmaS and Hfq proteins. But while GSR and the stress proteins which underpin GSR are now understood in considerable detail, little is known of the mechanistic basis of LSMMG biofilms. The focus of this investigation is to explore the identity of the regulators of GSR (GSRR) and of stress proteins that determine LSMMG biofilm resistance. Wild type and selected GSRR mutant [sigmaS, Hfq, sigmaS-Hfq, or another GSRR double mutant (e.g., sigmaS-sigma54)] biofilms will be grown under LSMMG and NG conditions, using our Earth-based bioreactors. The development and resistance of the biofilms grown under the two conditions will be compared. For determining resistance, mechanistically different stressors (i.e., those with different modes of killing bacteria) including disinfectants (ethanol, NaCl) and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ampicillin) will be used. Survival will be determined using live dead stains and confocal microscopy in combination with appropriate software; viable cell count will also be used in selected cases. The relationship between the expression of GSR regulators and LSMMG-conferred resistance will be determined in bulk biofilms by Western analysis. It will also be determined within individual biofilm regions, using multiple approaches which will rely on GFP-expressing regulator fusions, live-dead stains, and confocal microscopy. The LSMMG-induced proteome of the wild type and the mutant showing greatest impairment in LSMMG resistance will be compared to detect the proteins involved in this resistance; their identification will be made more precise by excluding from among the implicated proteins those also induced in the mutant (impaired in LSMMG resistance). IPTG-inducible scFv antibodies will be used to functionally inactivate selected proteins in the wild type at appropriate times during biofilm development to confirm their role in LSMMG resistance. Fundamental information of the mechanistic basis of LSMMG and Earth biofilms will result, which can suggest ways for their better control. This research thus fully addresses the solicitation: it deals with the role of stress proteins in LSMMG biofilm resistance; it utilizes Earth-based approaches that can be tested in space; and it deals with the question of how life responds to gravity in space and on Earth.",

These infections cause the disease cystitis, which leads to approximately 8 million doctor visits by women each year in the United States alone. UPEC attach to the epithelium of the bladder and upper urinary tract and form what are known as biofilms. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that attach to surfaces and can evade host immune responses, as well as resist antibiotics. This form of bacterial growth often leads to chronic infections that are difficult to cure. Biofilms also attach to surfaces onboard spacecraft, presenting a potential pathogen reservoir that threatens astronaut health during spaceflight. Our previous work indicated that biofilms exhibit greater resistance to disinfectants and antibiotics in conditions that mimic the microgravity environment on Earth. These conditions are generated in rotating vessel bioreactors, which prevent cell sedimentation and provide a quiescent or “low-shear” fluid environment similar to that of microgravity during spaceflight. We developed a system using glass beads for biofilm surface attachment permitting study of the “low-shear modeled microgravity environment” (LSMMG) on Earth. We found that this environment further increased UPEC resistance to antimicrobial treatment, making the bacteria superresistant. The objective of our current study is to better understand the stress-response mechanisms by which UPEC cope with the stress generated by antimicrobials. This includes UPEC in slow growing states such as stationary-phase and biofilms. LSMMG bioreactors provide a unique environment for studying resistance mechanisms of an important bacterial pathogen. We are also studying these stress response mechanisms under normal gravity conditions to better understand the underlying biology/biochemistry and to provide an appropriate framework for comparing the LSMMG results. Insights from our work will provide valuable knowledge for developing new forms of treatment aimed against UPEC, as well as other bacterial pathogens, which will benefit humans on Earth as well as onboard spacecraft."

            "task_progress": "The proposed work concerned with testing of several stress-response regulator genes of Escherichia coli, especially sigmaS (sS)  as regards their resistance to antibiotics in our system for growing bacterial biofilms under low-shear modeled microgravity environment (LSMMG) (1). (Bacterial sigma factors play a central role in determining what genes a bacterium will express under a given set of conditions.) This work included both uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), which causes cystitis, as well as the more standard and better studied E. coli K12 strain; the former for its pathogenic potential and importance and the latter because it provides a richer background framework for interpreting results and has available a complete library of mutants in all individual genes. Our central point of interest are stationary phase bacteria because they as planktonic as well as biofilm forms are responsible for most infections and are highly resistant to killing both by disinfectants as well as antibiotics. The UPEC strain used in these studies is a clinical isolate obtained from a patient at Stanford Hospital and studied in the Matin lab over the past 5 or so years (2,3); it is referred to as strain AMG1.\nIt is logical to first establish the mechanism of resistance under normal gravity (NG) conditions in order to properly interpret and put in context the experiments conducted under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment, and this is where we began. We first repeated the starting point experiments of this investigation to statistically reliable results as well as extending them to two both strains of E. coli.\nStationary phase cultures were exposed to antibiotics in a standard medium (M9) without glucose. No growth can occur in such media, so the bacteria experience antibiotic exposure in stationary phase. The cultures were not shaken to generate low oxygen conditions such as the ones that may be found in the gut (4). At daily intervals, a sample from each culture was serially diluted and plated on a solid nutrient medium (LB agar) to determine viability. The rpoS mutant (missing sS) consistently showed an approximately four-log reduction in the number of viable cells compared to the wild-type regardless of the primary mode of action of the three antibiotics used. Thus, ampicillin is a ß-lactam (inhibits cell wall synthesis), ciprofloxacin is a quinolone (inhibits DNA synthesis) and gentamicin is an aminoglycoside (inhibits protein synthesis). Very similar results were obtained with the K12 strain for all three antibiotics. From this point on, we focused on gentamicin to limit the scope of the investigation to permit an in-depth study and because this antibiotic is a common treatment for cystitis.\nIn accordance with our proposal, we also tested the effect of two other stress-response regulators, namely the RNA chaperone Hfq and another sigma factor sN.  Hfq is a positive regulator of RpoS (5), and RpoN has overlapping function with sS. As expected, the hfq mutant behaved like the rpoS mutant, but unexpectedly, not the rpoN mutant (missing sN); the latter finding points to diversity within the regulatory pathways determining resistance to individual antimicrobials and deserves further investigation.\nTo gain an insight in the molecular/biochemical mechanism underlying enhanced general antibiotic sensitivity of the stationary phase cells due to the loss of sS, we carried out proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-DiGE). We used the K12 wild-type and isogenic sS-deficient strains in these studies because of the advantage offered by a sequenced strain to permit definitive identification of the implicated proteins (genes), and the availability in this strain of an existing gene-deletion library that would facilitate examination of individual proteins (genes) that might be implicated in RpoS-mediatd antibiotic resistance. Briefly, the two stationary phase E. coli strains (wild type and delta rpoS) were incubated in M9 medium (minus glucose) with or without gentamicin (16µg/ml) for 2 days. The cells were lysed, protein concentrations assayed and equal amounts from paired samples (individual strain grown with and without the antibiotic) were labeled by CyDye Difference in Gel Electrophoresis (DiGE) fluorophores (size and charge matched). 2D-DiGE was used (Applied Biomics, Hayward, California) to separate samples using isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. The gels were scanned using a Typhoon image scanner to reveal CyDye signals. ImageQuant software was used to generate single and overlay images, which were then subjected to DeCyder software analysis to determine differentially expressed protein spots. An Ettan Spot Picker was used to pick spots of interest, which were subsequently identified by MS/MS. The approach increases sensitivity and permits comparison of protein expression levels within and between gels. Cluster analysis was employed to elucidate altered functional pathways.\nTwo striking findings resulted. a) Cluster analysis to indicate the key functional pathways altered in response to gentamicin gave the highest enrichment score for peroxidase activity, followed by iron storage, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavoprotein activity, metal ion binding, and altered monosaccharide metabolic/catabolic processes. And b) that a majority of the proteins (13 out of 21) that the absence of sS down-regulated were further decreased by gentamicin treatment, and consistent with the cluster analysis many of these included oxidative stress defense and catabolic proteins. In particular, these studies implicated a metabolic pathway that has never been proposed to be involved in antibiotic sensitivity.\nAmong other things, the proteomic analysis suggested that a major reason for greater sensitivity of the rpoS mutant to gentamicin and other antibiotics might be the inability of the latter strain to cope with the oxidative stress, which antibiotic treatment causes (5a). We therefore determined reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the wild type and the mutant following antibiotic treatment. These were measured by a commercially available kit (Invitrogen). Controls without antibiotics were used to determine the degree of increase in fluorescence due to antibiotic exposure. The mutant did indeed generate 5-6 times more ROS when challenged with the antibiotics compared to the wild type.\nWe rested mutants missing individual genes of the anti-oxidant defense mechanism and other stresses and found with this and other approaches that the oxidative stress did indeed play a role in antibiotic toxicity and this was exacerbated in the rpoS mutant.\nWe then asked the question if these findings were applicable to in vivo situations. To pursue this I established collaboration with the group of Dr. Michael Hsieh of our Urology Department who has developed an in vivo mouse model for studying cystitis. Seven week old CBA/J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were acclimated to our animal facility for one week prior to experimental manipulation. Transurethral inoculation of 107 bacteria/50µl/mouse was performed using the wild type or the delta rpoS (rpoS mutant) strain. Serial stationary phase cultures of the two strains were grown in LB broth in ambient temperature and air with shaking at 200 rpm in order to enhance type I pili expression – these are appendages that enable the bacteria to colonize the urinary tract. The bacteria were then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and their perineums were cleaned with 70% ethanol. To ensure mouse bladders did not overflow during transurethral inoculation, animals were deprived of water for 30 minutes prior to anesthesia induction (to reduce urine output), and encouraged to void by scruffing and gently pressing the low abdomen. Using PE10 polyethylene tubing-covered 30 gauge needles, mice were transurethrally catheterized and the inoculum injected over 5 seconds. Immediately after infection, the mice were administered PBS or 50, 5, or 0.5  µg of gentamicin by subcutaneous injection, followed by four more doses every 2 hours (total of five doses). Two days after infection, the mice were sacrificed by a combination of isoflurane overdose and cervical dislocation. Mouse bladders were removed aseptically and homogenized using sterile 1.6 mm stainless steel beads and a Bullet Blender homogenizer. 100 ml of each bladder homogenate, as well as tenfold dilutions, were cultured on MacConkey agar overnight under ambient conditions. The following day, the number of bacteria was determined in each bladder by plate count. Both wild type and rpoS-deficient UPEC colonized the mouse bladder after transurethral inoculation. At 50 µg gentamicin eliminated both strains from the bladders; at 5 µg gentamicin bladder colonization of both strains continued to be suppressed. However, at 0.5 µg of gentamicin, wild type UPEC could successfully colonize the bladder, whereas rpoS-deficient UPEC was severely hampered (2 log reduction in median bacterial count. We were also able to establish, for the first time, that oxidative stress played a role in gentamicin toxicity in vio.\nThat oxidative stress has a central role in the antibacterial activity of antibiotics is consistent with previous findings, but the mechanistic basis indicated by our work differs drastically with the only one previously proposed. Kohanski et al (6) compared the effect on the proteome of E. coli treated with bactericidal or bacteriostatic antibiotics and concluded that the bactericidal antibiotic treatment resulted in an oxidative burst. During respiration, the NADH dehydrogenase of the electron transport chain leaks superoxide (O.) (7); according to Kohanski et al, this leakage is enhanced upon antibiotic treatment due to the oxidative burst. This in turn decomposes iron-sulfur clusters, releases iron, resulting in the Fenton reaction that greatly intensifies the oxidative stress.  They reasoned therefore that elimination of steps that generate NADH will, by minimizing the oxidative burst, protect the bacteria from the antibiotics, as will mutations that decrease the iron-sulfur clusters inside the cell (8).  Indeed, mutant strains lacking the Krebs cycle enzymes aconitase (acnB), isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd) succinate dehydrogenase (suc), and the mutant iscS, (the last impaired in iron sulfur cluster synthesis (8)) showed lowered sensitivity to the antibiotics. This Kohanski et al ascribed to decreased oxidative burst resulting from reduced NADH formation. However, no direct evidence was presented to support the notion that the primary event is the oxidative burst due to transient stimulation of metabolism caused by antibiotic addition. The only justification for this conclusion was the fact that Kohanski et al observed a decrease in NADH, concluding that this occurred because of its rapid oxidation by the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase.\nOur proteomic data and subsequent experiments point to a very different primary event and we have also conducted experiments that indicate that the resistance of the mutants used by Kohanski et al can be explained on a basis other than the one they proposed. These results are included in the Final Technical Report to NASA and will be the subject of papers currently in preparation.\nII. Microfuidic high-throughput device for screening flow biofilms\nThe above findings point to the desirability of screening small molecule libraries that would selectively inhibit ss (most desirably its unique sequences), and specific elements of the bacterial pathway implicated in antibiotic resistance by our studies in order to potentiate the killing effect of antibiotics. Flow biofilms (also called irrigated biofilms) are grown with continuous flow of fresh medium through the growth chamber and more closely approximate the natural biofilms. No system had been available for conducting high throughput screening of such biofilms. We therefore teamed up with Fluxion Biosciences, Inc (San Francisco) to achieve this. This work has been published (9), and will be briefly summarized here. A device was designed, which consists of microfluidic channels integrated into microtiter well plates. The use of a standard well plate format allowed compatibility with plate readers and multichannel pipettors, and the plate also could be examined microscopically. The microfluidic channels are generated using photolithography etched micropatterned silicon wafers as a mold for polydimethylsiloxane, which forms the sides and roofs of the channels. The bottom of the channels consists of standard 180-µm coverslip glass, which allows microscopic examination. The channels connect pairs of microtiter wells; one well of each pair is the inlet well from which fresh medium is pushed by pneumatic pressure through the channel into the outlet well, which holds the spent medium. The microfluidic channels are 1/10th the size of conventional flow cells, which permits laminar flow at a wider range of flow rates and results in uniform biofilm growth in the entire channel. We found that the Pseudomonas fluorescens PAO1 biofilm formation in this device resembled that found in the conventional flow cells (which are not amenable to high throughput screening).  The system includes an air compressor and electropneumatic regulators to deliver precisely controlled pressure to each channel via a manifold that interfaces with individual wells of the microtiter plate. Thus, the flow (and shear) rate in each channel can be controlled individually. A thin transparent heating stage provides temperature control, and a software interface permits control of the flow rate by the user and saving and reuse of experimental profiles. Unlike conventional flow cell systems, the BioFlux plates are pre-sterilized and do not require assembly or tubing connections, which minimizes the possibility of contamination. The plates each contain 24 channels connecting 48 wells. The BioFlux system controls four plates simultaneously, providing a total of 96 biofilms. Each inlet well and outlet well holds 1.25 ml of liquid, so there can be 11 to 20 h of continuous flow before replenishment is necessary at commonly used flow rates. The small volume of the microchannels also results in conservation of reagents.\nWe established that this device can be used to screen the effects of antimicrobial agents on flow biofilms using GFP-expressing PAO1 biofilms. These were treated with bleach or antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, or enrofloxacin) and then stained with propidium iodide (PI), followed by measurement of fluorescence in a plate reader. Both the bleach and the antibiotics caused dose dependent biofilm killing, as determined by fluorescence measured with the plate reader. The quinolones had the most potent effect; ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin caused complete loss of viability at concentrations of 1 and 10 µg/ml, respectively. As a further check of the reliability of rapid plate reader scanning for determination of viability, we analyzed biofilm images obtained by fluorescence microscopy. The biofilm viability calculated from fluorescence ratios obtained using microscope images agreed with that measured with the plate reader; the correlation coefficient (r=0.9565; P <0.0001) and linear regression analysis verified that there was a strong correlation between the results of the two methods. The fluorescent microscope images confirmed that the quinolones completely eradicated the biofilms (ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 1 µg/ml and enrofloxacin at a concentration of 10 µg/ml), as indicated by the complete absence of fluorescence.\nIII. Device for high throughput screening of biofilms under LSMMG conditions\nWe have designed a prototype multi-well screening plate, which fits into the 50 ml HARV vessel and will allow screening of multiple mutants under LSMMG. The screening apparatus is composed of multiple growth chambers of dimensions 5 mm deep and 7 mm diameter (volume 462mm3) with a semi-permeable membrane heat-sealed to the rear of the plate and a syringe-permeable rubber mat to the front. This will allow 96 mutants to be screened per overnight HARV run. A randomly tagged mutant library can thus be tested for specific gene expression under LSMMG using standard methods.\nIV. LSMMG studies\nThroughout this project period we initiated studies to test the findings described in Section 1 under LSMMG conditions using our HARV-based system of growing biofilms under such conditions. Two issues prevented much progress on this front. a) The complexity of the system required persistence in the face of conflicting results by workers new to and inexperienced in the system; my previous team was dismantled due to hiatus in microgravity-related funding. And b), perhaps more importantly, the exciting progress that normal gravity studies provided, as discussed above, generated a momentum to obtain a clear picture. My co-workers felt that it was more important to sort out the mechanism in the much more amenable normal gravity system so as to crystallize more clearly the critical experiments that then can be done in the more complex LSMMG conditions – I agreed with them.\nAs a result of these studies, we are currently working with NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field to test these results for UPEC under conditions of real microgravity on a small satellite taking advantage of the existing PharmaSat hardware, which is being adjusted to the needs for work with bacteria; the test antibiotic is gentamycin. Viability determinations in space and their telemetric transmission to Earth will rely on the use of AlamarBlue (AB). We have obtained results that show that the AB use clearly indicates the much enhanced sensitivity of rpoS UPEC to gentamycin. AB turns magenta due to the activity of bacteria; it is clear that the mutant is much more impaired in generating the magenta color after  gentamicin treatment than the wild type.\nV.

            "task_progress": "Overview and Objectives – a Synopsis\nDuring spaceflight, plants experience growth and developmental conditions that are distinctly unlike the terrestrial environment that has directed the evolution of gene expression patterns that ensure survival. Plants must therefore interpret novel stimuli, integrate new solutions and express potentially unusual suites of genes in an attempt to cope with spaceflight environments. Some of these responses might be directly interpretable as appropriate responses that clearly inform science of the stresses induced by spaceflight. Other responses might be confused or inappropriate due to the novel signals or biological processes present in the milieu of the spaceflight environment. Defining both kinds of responses is critical to understanding biological response and adaptation to all kinds of extraterrestrial environments, from vehicles in orbit to lunar habitats.\nOur objective is to answer fundamental questions regarding the metabolic and molecular response of plants to novel, spaceflight relevant, environments. In the current project we build on extensive insights gained from spaceflight and analog experiments to develop new biological tools and to guide hardware development to study the response to these environments with higher fidelity and wider scope. The biology will include new biosensors created to dissect the mechanisms by which molecular signals are conveyed and integrated into responses to spaceflight environments. Some biosensors will be linked to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) spectral variants to facilitate telemetric data collection, which will in turn enable robust robotic experiments with wide deployment options. The hardware to support this telemetric science, will be advanced in concept to include multiple spectral capacities in order to monitor multiple biosensor reporter genes simultaneously. The focus is on advancing telemetric imaging that will enable the potential future deployment of such biosensor-units in a wide range of potential spaceflight applications - ISS, crew vehicles, satellites and lunar or Mars packages - as the opportunities present. These experiments address the need to understand the biological response of eukaryotes to spaceflight, and other novel environments at the molecular and cellular level, with special focus on signaling pathways and gene expression.\nSummary\nFocus and Opportunities\nThe final year of the grant continued to help support people and efforts for additional characterizations of returned Flight materials from the PIs’ two Flight Experiments: APEX-TAGES and BRIC-16, as well as contributing to the support of ancillary analyses associated with the BRIC-17 returned material. Space Biology support enabled an additional level of analyses of these samples, and facilitated supplemental ground studies that continue to contribute to our understanding of the response of biology to spaceflight and novel environments. The data analyses led to the design and support of several analog studies initiated last year: 1) clinorotation and gravity vector disruption, including root skewing analyses in inclined planes, 2) hypergravity tests with a 2-3g centrifuge, and 3) a parabolic flight campaign opportunity and suborbital flight preparations in high performance aircraft (in support of two FO awards).\nThe concomitant ground and flight support represented by these grants enables us to combine the processes of flight biology preparation, flight data analysis, and hypothesis development and testing for unprecedented insight into biological responses to these novel environments.  The execution of this grant was (and continues to be) the ideal example of what NASA intended as the role of Space Biology Ground-Based Research: NRA-01-OBPR-06 “…to expand our understanding of fundamental biological processes and the mechanisms by which these processes sense, respond, adapt to, and evolve in the space environment…and in particular… the role of the genome and cellular structures in sensing and responding to gravitational force.”\nThe final year of the grant had several foci:\nUndifferentiated cells - cell sensing and signal transduction:   The results of the BRIC-16 experiment (see FSB 2012 report and related BRIC-16 report) revealed that undifferentiated cells can detect the spaceflight environment and altered gravity in the absence of differentiated tissue or organized developmental structures (Paul et al. 2012: BMC Plant Biology. 12:232\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/12/232\n, Zupanska et al. 2013: American Journal of Botany. 100:235-248). One of the most striking results was the engagement of “heat shock” and protein chaperone genes The results from the tissue culture experiments leads us to further dissect the sensory and signal mechanism(s) that cell cultures use to detect and respond to spaceflight. To further address these questions, we started a series of ground experiments to test signal transduction pathways in unit gravity, and to also stage out biological tools for future flight opportunities.  We initiated several new tissue culture lines, some of them containing GFP reporters, and others that are deficient in key chaperone genes.  Experiments with cultures carrying known mutations that are well characterized in the gravity sensation and signaling of intact plants will provide insight into the mechanisms behind those processes. If cell cultures are using these typical sensing and signaling elements, the mutations should greatly attenuate the cell culture responses\nReporter gene line development:   The results of the APEX-01 / TAGES and the BRIC 16 experiment revealed that a large number of genes were differentially expressed in response to the spaceflight environment (Paul et al. 2012: BMC Plant Biology. 12:232\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/12/232\n; Paul et al 2013: BMC Plant Biology. 13:112\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/112\n).  These results initiated the development of a variety of new GFP-reporter gene lines to support spaceflight applications.\nBiosensors in calcium-signaling mutant backgrounds:   A number of reporters were developed in calcium signaling mutant backgrounds; two lines show differential expression of the reporter gene in plants deficient in aspects of calcium signaling.\nQuality testing of flight hardware:   This grant helped to support the bio-compatibility testing of two types of spaceflight hardware under consideration, the Aluminum PDFUs for future BRIC experiments, and a new ceramic foam sponge for the ABRS plant biology growth chamber.\nParabolic flight campaigns (Zero-G):   This Space Biology grant contributed to the support of several parabolic flight campaigns that were awarded through the Flight Opportunities Office.  Since FO does not provide operations support, it is essential that the PIs have some other source of NASA funding to support the personnel and analyses. Our NASA NNX09AL96G grant was the foundation of this support, and crucial for our success.\nPerformance aircraft for Sub-orbital application:   The other un-supported Flight Opportunity Award received by the PIs is for a series of suborbital flights. This Space Biology grant also contributed to the support of preparations for the suborbital FO by conducting hardware and biology tests in high performance aircraft (T6 and F104).\nConcluding remarks:   We have accomplished an amazing amount of diverse, spaceflight-related science with this grant. Having this support has allowed us to develop a large range of biological and engineering tools to support four flight experiments, three parabolic flight campaigns, and enhance the technical readiness of our upcoming suborbital flight opportunity – all while conducting novel, fundamental ground-based research that expands the communities understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the spaceflight acclimation of plants. This research funding contributed to 16 publications over its lifetime, and to the support of three PhD students (Anne Visscher, Eric Schultz, Natasha Sng), three undergraduates (Lauren Frizzle, Justin Goodwyn, Zackary Guignardi), four postdoctoral associates (Agata Zupanska, Fiona Denison, Matthew Bamsey, Thomas Graham), and two biological scientists (Claire Amalfitano, Lawrence Rasmussen).",

            "task_description": "Modeling the microgravity environment, using rotating suspension culture bioreactors, allows investigation of eukaryotic cellular responses in a ground-based model and provides insights into the impact of space flight on cellular physiology. We have previously demonstrated that simulated microgravity induces morphologic changes and differential expression of several groups of yeast genes, including those related to morphogenic transformation, polarity determination, and the unique environmental stress of microgravity.  The focus of this application is to characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for the eukaryotic microbial response to microgravity using ground-based models. Choosing organisms from the fungal world is based on two criteria; (1) the microbial system is a powerful model to examine fundamental aspects of cell biology common to eukaryotic systems and, (2) infection by yeast pathogens (Candida albicans) is a concern for human health.  The overall objective of this proposal is to examine the hypothesis that cells exposed to microgravity undergo phenotypic and genotypic changes that alter polarity determination. The net result of altered polarity is demonstrated by filamentation in Candida albicans, a physiological feature consistent with increased pathogenicity.  Signal transduction pathways involved in sensing mechanoreception driving these responses will be addressed. Ultimately, the propensity for increased biofilm formation and virulence will also be evaluated in Candida albicans subjected to simulated microgravity. Given the flexible requirements for yeast growth and the availability of molecular tools in the yeast system, these ground-based studies can be readily adapted to space-flight testing.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Using the Candida albicans yeast system, we have demonstrated that simulated microgravity affects differential expression of several groups of genes, including those related to morphogenic transformation, environmental sensing and ergosterol biosynthesis; induces morphologic changes such as filamentation, biofilm formation, and colony morphology; and results in an increased resistance to the antimicrobial agent Amphotericin B.  The constellation of these physiological responses is consistent with a potential increase in the virulence of this opportunistic yeast pathogen.  The data obtained in these studies provides a foundation on which to explore microgravity- and other extreme environment-induced physiological changes in a eukaryotic pathogen and further establishes LSMMG as a model system."

            "task_progress": "The overall objective of this proposal was to examine the hypothesis that cells exposed to microgravity undergo physical changes that affect the ability to sense direction, or have an altered polarity. One result of altered polarity in yeast is a changed budding pattern in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Brewer’s yeast) and filamentation in Candida albicans (an opportunistic pathogen) consistent with increased pathogenicity.  Although our initial proposal included studies on S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, the C. albicans work became a priority based on interesting research results and the potential implications of the results as an opportunistic yeast pathogen.  Ultimately, phenotypic markers associated with increased virulence in C. albicans, and the environmental cues that trigger them, were evaluated following exposure to low-shear modeled microgravity.  The studies performed in this proposal were designed to be readily replicated in spaceflight conditions.  Indeed, our proposal for a flight opportunity was approved and C. albicans was flown as Micro-6 on SpX CRS-1.  The conclusion of this grant included a transition to the flight studies, which will be reported under separate cover.\nCandida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of cutaneous and systemic human infections.  Virulence of C. albicans increases upon exposure to some environmental stresses; therefore, we explored phenotypic responses of C. albicans following exposure to the environmental stress of low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG).  Upon long-term (12 day) exposure to low-shear modeled microgravity, C. albicans transitioned from yeast to filamentous forms at a higher rate than observed under control conditions.  Consistently, genes associated with cellular morphology, including Yeast Wall Protein (YWP1) and Hyphal Wall Protein (HWP1) were differentially expressed in a time-dependent manner.  Biofilm communities, credited with enhanced resistance to environmental stress, formed in the modeled microgravity bioreactor and had a more complex structure than those formed in control conditions.  Likewise, the expression of genes associated with biofilm formation and the yeast to hyphal transition, including adhesin genes (ALS1 and ALS3) and the transcriptional regulator, BCR1, was altered following exposure to LSMMG.  In addition to the LSMMG-induced alterations in community structure observed with biofilm formation, cells exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity displayed phenotypic switching, observed as a near complete transition from smooth to “hyper” irregular wrinkle colony morphology.  This colony phenotype has been associated with cells that also demonstrate an increased aggressiveness in terms of causing infection.  Consistent with the presence of biofilm communities and increased rates of phenotypic switching, cells exposed to modeled microgravity were significantly more resistant to the antifungal agent Amphotericin B.  Together, these data indicate that C. albicans adapts to the environmental stress of low-shear modeled microgravity by demonstrating virulence-associated phenotypes.\nC. albicans appears to maintain a semi-stable phenotypic state while retaining the flexibility necessary for rapid adaptation to environmental stresses, including filamentation, biofilm formation, phenotypic switching, and changes in the expression of several hundred genes.  Data presented herein support a time-dependent, LSMMG-induced increase in cellular filamentation, altered colony morphology, biofilm formation and maturation, and antifungal resistance of C. albicans.  Individually, and certainly in concert, these phenotypic transitions are suggestive of organisms that also have an increased propensity to cause infection and evade therapy.  Further studies indicated that the yeast phenotypic adaptations to the low fluid shear environment were, at least in part, modulated by increased CO2 levels in the microenvironment.  LSMMG appears to increase the potential for pathogenicity of C. albicans and, thus, may also serve as a model system for analyzing the low-shear in vivo environment often associated with C. albicans infections.\nThe possibility that environmental sensing of the microgravity/low fluid-shear environment triggers a transition to a more pathogenic form of the organism could have clear implications for human health.  The host-microbe interactions in spaceflight are important in their own right, but can also be extrapolated to similar interactions associated with the common, ground-based population.  The immune system becomes generally less resilient upon aging.  Furthermore, the number of immunocompromised individuals is increasing as a result of the use of chemotherapy and other immunosuppressant drugs.  Analysis of the effects of LSMMG on pathogen virulence could provide an informed foundation to identify astronaut risk, as well as provide better understanding of the more generally applicable molecular mechanisms involved in host-pathogen interactions.\nA manuscript has been submitted to PLos One and is in review (see Bibliography below); another is in preparation for submission (Searles SC, Hyman LE, Nielsen-Preiss SM \"Effects of modeled microgravity on C. albicans ergosterol\").",

            "task_description": "This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. As in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments. Additional benefits of the project include training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "In addition to an improved understanding of basic biological questions, such as identification of the site of graviperception, curvature-induced (but not gravity-dependent) gene expression, the experiment also tests the effect of magnetic fields on plant roots. Therefore, biological questions are investigated in conjunction with physical principles. We intend to analyze the effect of static magnetic fields on biological systems. This work will provide a starting point for the current discussion of the detrimental effects of (electro)magnetic fields. In addition, understanding basic biological questions will improve the prospect for enhanced plant productivity, resource optimization, and reduced maintenance."

            "task_progress": "Report for activities since April 2015\nTime line: Space-X3 launched April 18, 2014; the payload returned May 18 and arrived at KSC 5/21/14. Post flight processing was accomplished between 5/22 and 5/25/14. Ground control experiments (performed Aug. 14, 2014) ran into additional delays because of a shortage of hardware (MFCs were badly corroded during flight experiment so that flight hardware could not be used for the ground control). The first ground control experiment resulted in lack of germination (likely the result of RNALater related NH3 contamination), and fixative leaked. Difficulties to obtain approval for a second clinorotated ground control delayed the second ground control experiment until Jan. 7, 2015. A no-cost extension ensured that most (but not all) analyses were completed. Subsequent work was substantially affected by the departure of the post-doctoral research associate who obtained a job offer in Korea that could not be refused or postponed.\nThe analyses of cytoskeletal arrangements was performed by confocal microcopy by June 2015; analyses are ongoing and almost complete. This effort is part of Andrea Edge’s PhD research.   Light microscopy started with sample embedding during de-integration; sectioning was performed in a six-month period (4/2015 – 9/2015, together with corresponding samples from ground controls). Analyses are partially complete and ongoing. Substantial results were obtained.  The experiment provided exciting insights in the gravitropic mechanism of roots, their adaptive responses, and gene regulation during flight and ground controls.\nResults:\nFlight experiment:\nA) Imaging.   The most important part of the flight experiment was the confirmation of the effect of high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) on root curvature. The data provide clear evidence that HGMF does induce root curvature as theory and ground experiments predicted. Because curvature occurred in weightlessness conditions, the gravisensing system of roots is not compromised by space flight. The enhancement of the amyloplast size in space-grown roots (see D, below) indicates metabolic adaptation to reduced effective gravity levels. The induction of curvature by HGMF in space-grown roots indicates that amyloplasts are indeed the organelles that elicit differential growth and therefore the originators of gravitropism.\nB) Cytoskeletal arrangements.   The comparison between static, clinorotated, and space grown roots did not show any substantial differences between the cytoskeletal organization of actin or microtubules. A high resolution analysis showed a greater variation in orientation and coherency of both microtubules and F-actin after clinorotation.\nC) Gene expression.   The examined genes were selected to metabolic relevance and connection to differential elongation. The chosen genes were (in order of average transcription levels with accession number in parentheses): Cytochrome c oxidase, amylase, Ubiquitin, Phosphofructokinase, Hexokinase, Alcohol dehydrogenase, Tubulin, Actin 7, P Pin-formed 1, 3, 7, Sucrose synthase, IAA transcription factor 5, Glucokinase, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Triacylglycerol lipase.\nComparisons of different conditions included flight conditions, clinorotation, and static ground conditions, with and without HGMF. Measurements were performed in the root tip, root proper, root shoot junction, and seed tissue. Gene transcription levels were assessed with validated primers using SYBR-Green based qPCR analysis.\nComparisons were based on regressions of the transcription levels of all examined genes and served as basis for the identification of up-or downregulated genes. The methodology resulted in a publication (Houston et al., 2015) and provides reliable assessment of gene regulation. Genes that responded to space condition, clinorotation, and HGMF included auxin transporter PIN1-7, enzymes involved in glycolysis (hexokinase, glucokinase), and sucrose synthase. However, not all tissues responded equally.\nD) Light microscopy.   The purpose of these studies was the identification of amyloplast positioning and size in the root cap. The difference between the size of amyloplasts from space-grown roots and those obtained from clinorotated or static roots was derived from systematic measurements of all detectable starch grains. The difference was highly significant and amounted to an approximate size increase of 30% in diameter. The amyloplast studies are important because they indicate that clinorotation (i.e., hyper-stimulation) reduces amyloplast size. Therefore clinorotation is likely to reduce gravisensitivity.\nIt is anticipated that a publication reporting on the results of the flight experiment will be submitted by summer 2016.",

This project also will allow us to directly correlate results from cytological investigations and gene profiling in order to understand the nature of the actin cytoskeleton in mechanisms of gravity perception.\nThis proposed research focuses on the effects of gravity on basic cellular mechanisms and processes in plants, so it is relevant to the emphasis on using Arabidopsis as a model system in developmental biology highlighted in the current NRA. The PI's group has extensive experience with the use of Arabidopsis in experiments on the Space Shuttle and the ISS. Preliminary data on the growth of seedlings in the BRIC-LED system and from the gene profiling studies performed during our recent experiments on the ISS are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed project. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this research is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.",

We investigated the effects of microgravity on the growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Landsberg)  in a spaceflight experiment.  These studies were performed using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware system in the middeck region of the Space Shuttle during mission STS-131 in April 2010.  Seedlings were grown on nutrient agar in Petri dishes in BRIC hardware under dark conditions and then were fixed in-flight with paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or RNAlater®.  Although the long-term objective was to study the role of the actin cytoskeleton in gravity perception, in this paper, we focus on the analysis of morphology of seedlings that developed in microgravity.  While previous spaceflight studies noted deleterious morphological effects due to the accumulation of ethylene gas, no such effects were observed in seedlings grown using the BRIC system. Seed germination was 89% in the spaceflight experiment and 91% in the ground control, and seedlings grew equally well in both conditions.  However, roots of space-grown seedlings exhibited a significant difference (compared to the ground controls) in overall growth patterns in that they skewed to one direction.  In addition, a greater number of adventitious roots formed from the axis of the hypocotyls in the flight-grown plants.   Our hypothesis is that an endogenous response in plants causes the roots to skew and that this default growth response is largely masked by the normal 1-g conditions on Earth.\nIn the last year, we continued morphometric studies of the space-grown seedlings with light and electron microscopy.  We also focused on gene profiling studies by using microarray techniques.",

We here propose a Small Complete Mission (SCM) based on a Mission of Opportunity-2 nanosatellite we call SporeSat, which will adapt hardware and technologies from previous and current missions including: GeneSat, PharmaSat, O/OREOS and GraviSat. Our approach allows for real-time measurement of calcium signaling and maintenance of variable gravity treatments during the flight experiment. Our science objectives further current work that has documented molecular components of biomechanical transduction. Our technical objectives focus on refining our current lab-on-a-chip sensor system to build a new CEL-C Advanced bioCD designed for the micro-satellite platform. This project contributes to NASA's initiatives in the areas of both Astrobiology and Fundamental Space Biology and will advance the science and technology capabilities for future research and development of astronaut health programs as well as those for advanced life support for exploration in the space environment, the moon, and on other planets.",

A very fast response to stress is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by intracellular oxidation. Space flight is associated with increased oxidative damage after return to 1 g, suggesting that microgravity and/or the transition between gravity fields triggers a response.\nWe propose to use a model organism used previously for space flight, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Studies in both hyper- and microgravity have already established many of the physiological alterations, and work from our own laboratory suggests that oxidative stress is implicated in the molecular response under both conditions. We will use hypergravity as a test environment for gravity alterations, and to dissect out molecular and cellular responses as well as long-term physiological outcomes.\nThe goal is to provide a complete picture of the oxidative stress pathway in hypergravity, and to determine and select the key molecular functions and physiological read-outs to be tested in microgravity.\nThe aims are to quantify gravity-dependent cellular ROS production and to determine the key points of entry into the oxidative pathway by using mutants that show a physiologically  altered response to hypergravity.  This approach will give a picture of the stress pathway, starting from fast cellular changes triggered by sudden changes in the gravity vector, to tissue-specific gene and enzyme activity alterations.\nUnderstanding the stress pathway in hypergravity opens the venue into looking at the opposite transition in the gravity load, from 1 g to microgravity during space flight, and will help predict the cellular and physiological response to other stresses imposed by the space environment.",

The study was designed with three replicated experiments that supported strong statistical analysis and affirmation that the effects displayed by the plants were true characteristics of spaceflight adaptation, independent of localized environmental phenomenon. Experimental subsets were launched on STS-129, 130, and 131 in 2009/2010. Two approaches were used; GFP reporter genes were used to collect gene expression data in real time within GIS (GFP Imaging System) imaging hardware, growth morphology images were also collected, and plants were harvested on orbit to RNAlater for subsequent gene expression profiling with Affymetrix and RNASeq transcriptome analyses. Leaves, hypocotyls, and roots were examined independently, revealing that there are a number of organ-specific responses that Arabidopsis employs to respond to the spaceflight environment. Almost a third of the statistically significant, differentially expressed genes encode proteins typically associated with cell wall remodeling, including touch, pathogen response and wounding. Many were dramatically induced (between 5 and 25-fold). In addition, the unique imaging capabilities of the GIS housed in the ABRS unit enabled us to collect morphometric data on the patterns of root growth in the GFP reporter gene plants. These data revealed that there are fundamental differences in root growth and development on orbit, and that two common cultivars of Arabidopsis, Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0), are distinct in their responses to spaceflight. The dominance of touch-wound-remodeling responses in the molecular data, combined with the dramatic changes in root growth morphology, lead directly to hypotheses suitable for future proposals.",

This issue is especially important given reports that the crew's immune system is dysfunctional during flight, and our recent discovery that spaceflight increased the disease-causing potential and globally altered the gene expression of the human food-borne pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Our research also showed that many of the observed changes in Salmonella were associated with specific proteins in the cells, called RNA binding proteins, that bind to and regulate genetic material within the cell to control cellular characteristics in response to stress. In addition, our studies during spaceflight and using ground-based, spaceflight analogue culture systems have shown that increasing the concentration of certain ionic salts, like phosphates, in the growth media can prevent the increased disease causing potential observed for Salmonella during spaceflight. Interestingly, human cells also contain evolutionarily conserved RNA binding proteins that are very similar in structure and function to those found in bacteria. In human cells, these RNA binding proteins are critical for the cells proper function, including supporting a healthy immune system, maintaining tissue differentiation, and responding to cellular stress. We hypothesize that RNA binding regulatory proteins and their small RNA binding counterparts are key to a conserved, common cellular spaceflight response mechanism in both bacterial and human cells and that this response can be manipulated by environmental salt/ion levels. The implications of a universally conserved molecular response to spaceflight would affect NASA's approach to infectious disease risk assessment, development of biological processing systems for exploration, and changes in biodegradation during a mission. Indeed, if these responses are also observed in human cells, they may translate into knowledge of both the astronaut's response to infection and possibly larger physiological responses that are influenced by cellular changes.",

Specifically, we have shown that Hfq is an evolutionarily conserved central regulator of the microbial response to both spaceflight and spaceflight analogue culture in both Gram negative (Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) pathogens.  Thus, Hfq represents the first spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue induced regulator acting across bacterial species.  In addition, we have also shown that these culture environments regulate the virulence and/or pathogenesis related phenotypes of these same organisms in novel ways that are not observed when they are cultured under conventional conditions.\nII) A NASA-funded flight experiment on STS-131, operationally called STL-IMMUNE, was awarded as a part of this ground-based flight analogue research. The objectives of this flight experiment were directly related to and complemented our ground-based work (including use of the same cell types), the goal of which is to identify universally conserved molecular responses to ground-based spaceflight analogue culture across a variety of bacterial and mammalian cell types.  Specifically, the focus of STL-IMMUNE was to 1) understand the effect of microgravity on the host-pathogen interaction and infection process from the perspective of the human cell, and 2) understand the effect of microgravity alone on human cellular responses that are relevant to normal cellular homeostasis or transition to disease. STL-IMMUNE was the first space biology experiment to conduct an in-flight infection of human cells.\nWe have now finalized sample analysis for global alterations in both transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, cellular differentiation, immune function (inflammatory response mediators), and stress responses associated with spaceflight in the presence and absence of infection.  All flight sample comparisons were made to identical synchronous ground controls housed in duplicate CCM hardware as that used for flight. Through iTRAQ analysis, we have identified 86 total unique human proteins (95% confidence, 1% FDR) that were expressed by the HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells cultured on orbit either before or after infection with Salmonella Typhimurium. These proteins belonged to a range of different functional classes and categories, including those important for metabolism, apoptosis, cell communication, immune function, and others. Of the 89 proteins identified, a unique subset of these were found to be differentially regulated in response to spaceflight, and showed differences in response to infection between flight and ground cultures. Collectively, we found intriguing differences in how microgravity uniquely impacted the spaceflight infected intestinal cells as compared to the ground controls.  We have also finalized global proteomic response profiling for the A549 lung epithelial cells as well.  Moreover, immunohistochemical profiling has revealed differences in both distribution and expression patterns of targeted host cell proteins and alterations in cellular cytoarchitecture. A manuscript reporting these findings will be submitted in early 2014.",

It is widely accepted that sedimentation of starch filled amyloplasts in the columella of the root cap and endodermis of the hypocotyl act to initiate the gravitropic signal. However, although pH and Ca2+-based signals have been proposed as key elements in this plant response, the precise mechanisms translating physical force to biochemically transmissible signal is still poorly defined. Needed is a high resolution spatiotemporal map of changes in ion activities induced by the gravity signal. Such mapping will be achieved by confocal imaging of plants expressing a range of GFP-based probes targeted to different subcellular locales within the Arabidopsis seedling. In parallel, we will use machine-vision technologies to quantify the distribution of curvature along the root and hypocotyl axes during gravitropism. Curvature and ion change distribution maps will be measured in wild type and mutants known to be defective in the pathways that lead to gravity signal transduction. By mapping the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of ion signaling to these morphometric analyses, we will be able to pinpoint where and when each component is altering tropic response.\nPotential for translation to future spaceflight opportunities: These studies will develop a morphometric technology highly applicable to spaceflight analysis where existing hardware can be used to collect the time-lapse imaging required for morphometric analysis. Such analysis will develop a quantitative description of the effects of the flight environment on plant development at levels of architecture ranging from branching patterns to the kinematics of growth. This will allow us to ask questions only addressable by the unique environment of Space; for example, defining the effects of mutations on gravitational response thresholds.",

These probes have very high affinity for calcium allowing for the visualization of calcium signals that were previously undetectable and has applications to a wide range of stress signaling pathways in plants."

            "task_progress": "This grant covered research to map the dynamics of ionic signaling associated with gravity sensing and response. We have used this analysis to assess how well such signaling events can be linked to the control of plant development and to gain insight into the initial signaling events related to gravity perception in plants. Major goals have been to: (1) develop the imaging approaches to monitor Ca2+ signaling dynamics in wild type plants and in a range of gravitropism-related mutant backgrounds, (2) apply high-resolution growth analyses to correlate signaling events to growth control, and (3) characterize the potential for cross-talk between gravitropic signaling and other response systems.\n(A) Rapid and asymmetrical Ca2+ changes accompany gravity perception in the root.  We have used plants transformed with the GFP-based Ca2+ imaging probe cameleon YC3.6 to image the Ca2+ changes occurring in response to a range of abiotic stresses as well as gravistimulation (gravistimulation applied by rotation of the plant through 90 degrees). This sensor allowed us to resolve changes in Ca2+ levels in plants exhibiting gravitropic signaling/response with the major Ca2+ change occurring 10 minutes after gravistimulation. The timing of these changes was significant after the initiation of gravity response and we concluded most likely linked to the auxin-dependent machinery controlling growth responses, i.e. a late event in the gravitropic response following the initial events of perception. However, Ca2+ reporters with much higher sensitivities, the ‘YC-nanos’, have become available during this work and we have generated plants expressing a range of these sensors. Using these probes, we have been able to monitor Ca2+ changes that were previously undetected, most likely due to their much lower magnitude than required to alter YC3.6 signals. These Ca2+ changes occur in the lateral root cap and in the root cap columella (site of gravity perception) within 0.5-1 min of gravistimulation. This time-frame is within the presentation time of Arabidopsis, i.e. within the timing predicted for the generation of gravity signal transduction in the root cap.\nUnexpectedly, Ca2+ increases are also seen in mutants such as adg1 that lack starch and so are thought to not generate a directional signal to gravity in the root cap. However, the Ca2+ changes in these mutants are not linked to gravistimulation, occurring in a random pattern at the root tip in both vertically grown and gravistimulated plants. These results suggest that the starch filled amyloplasts in the root cap may be acting to localize gravitropic Ca2+-related signals in the sensory cells of the root tip and that without this strong directional component being maintained by the dense starch, the amyloplast membranes are free to interact with receptors at random. These random interactions would then generate the non-directional Ca2+ signals seen in the starchless mutants. This data supports the classic \"starch-statolith\" model where the mass of the starch in amyloplasts is required to reinforce the directional component of the gravity signaling system but is not required to trigger the perception machinery per se. Morphometric and kinematic analysis of the regional growth response of the root indicates all these Ca2+ changes occur well before gravitropic growth is detectable and they occur in regions of the root tip that do not show detectable cell elongation in response to gravistimulation. These data all suggest that these Ca2+ changes are likely part of the initial signaling events of gravitropic response.\n(B) Mutants in a range of Ca2+-related proteins alter gravitropic response.  In addition to analyzing a range of gravitropic response mutants such as adg1 we have also screened mutants in Ca2+-related proteins (e.g., Ca2+ transporters and Ca2+-binding proteins that are highly expressed in the root tip) for potential effects on gravitropic response. This has defined two Ca2+ transporters (ACA1 and CAX2) and the \"touch-related\" genes TCH1, TCH2, and TCH3 as showing reduced gravitropic response. Mutants in the Ca2+ transporters alter root tip Ca2+ signal dynamics, providing a likely link to their effects on growth. These transporters also play a role in anoxic response of the root, with the mutants showing resistance to anoxic challenge, providing a point of cross-talk between gravitropic signaling and root zone anoxia. A major limitation to root growth in spaceflight is thought to be root zone hypoxia/anoxia and so interactions between this signaling system and that of the gravitropic response have a potentially important influence on plant growth in microgravity.\nThe 'touch' genes (TCH1, 2, and 3) were identified from their transcriptional upregulation in response to mechanical stimulation but a role in gravitropic response has not been reported to date. We have determined that loss-of-function mutants in these genes show reduced gravitropic response but we have detected no clear alteration in Ca2+ signaling dynamics in these backgrounds. These observations suggest that these genes act downstream of the Ca2+ change, consistent with a role in interpreting the Ca2+ changes. All three of these TCH genes contain a Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. The touch-sensitivity of these genes also suggests a role in mechanical responses, suggesting they may act as a point of cross-talk between the mechanical and gravity sensing systems of the plant.\n(C) Hypergravity experiments support the need for sedimented amyloplasts in the gravity signaling system.   As part of our analysis of the initial gravity sensing machinery, we have been collaborating with Dr. Masatsugu Toyota and the lab of Miyo Morita (NAIST, Japan) in using a centrifuge microscope to define whether amyloplast directional movements are linked to graviresponse as well as characterizing the likely role of starch in this process. This new microscope allowed imaging of amyloplast movements while stems were experiencing up to 30xG. This analysis revealed that sedimentary movements of amyloplasts under hypergravity conditions are linearly correlated with gravitropic curvature in wild-type stems. It also showed that agravitropic mutants such as sgr2 and sgr9 have immobile amyloplasts at 1xG but their gravitropic response could be rescued by growing them at 10-30 x G. This rescuing of the mutant phenotype correlated with the G force required to force their amyloplasts to sediment. Similarly, starch deficient mutants have their graviresponse rescued by the increasing G-forces that caused sedimentation even of starchless plastids. These results lend further support to the “static” or “settled” statolith model where amyloplasts in the sensory cells must sediment to the lower face of the cell to elicit a gravitropic signal, consistent with the Ca2+ signaling responses to gravistimulation.",

            "task_description": "Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including microgravity, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). This results in limited plant growth, development and yield. Fortunately, through genetic engineering plants can be coaxed by humans to adapt to hostile environments. To take full advantage of this ability, we first have to understand how plants respond to stresses. Plants have evolved elaborate surveillance and response systems consisting of a large repertoire of sensors and transducers to cope with stress.\nFast stress management responses include activation of membrane-tethered transcription factors (MTTFs), which are dormant transcription factors when first synthesized. Following stress sensing, MTTFs are quickly released from the membrane anchor and re-targeted to the nucleus to invoke downstream responses. Although we have a wealth of knowledge of MTTFs in non-plant systems, it is still unclear how these factors function in plants. What we know, however, is that a handful of MTTFs of the AtbZIP family are anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and are activated in conditions of stress. Yet we do not have a complete picture of the type of stress that these AtbZIP-MTTFs respond to, nor of the mechanisms for their activation and stress transduction. Here, we propose to use cell biology, biochemistry, and genetics in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to address these important questions.\nThe results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of the long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. A better understanding of stress sensing, integration, and response mechanisms in plants will make possible the design and growth of plants resistant to space stresses, and of plants that function as stress biosensors. Development of our research will also contribute to the characterization of basic signaling pathways including cross-talk between the endomembrane system and the genome.",

            "task_progress": "Our project focuses on the dissection of the mechanisms that plants use to resist to stress with particular attention to signal transduction mediated by membrane-anchored sensors using techniques of cell biology, biochemistry, and genetics in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Similar to animals, plants suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such changes in temperature, reduced nutrients and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, can generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (Ron and Walter, 2007; Liu and Howell, 2010). The ER is the organelle that initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (Iwawaki et al., 2009; Deng et al., 2011; Chen and Brandizzi, 2012). In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (Tirasophon et al., 2000; Urano et al., 2000; Chen and Brandizzi, 2012).\nDuring our current award, we have advanced fundamental knowledge of the plant UPR. In particular, in addition to showing that AtIRE1 is a key regulator of UPR in Arabidopsis, we have also demonstrated that AtIRE1 controls root elongation in normal conditions of growth, thus revealing a physiological role to AtIRE1 in development (Chen and Brandizzi, 2012). We have been also able to demonstrate that AtIRE1 controls the expression of another UPR regulator, AGB1, which is a subunit of the ubiquitous heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein family (Jones and Assmann, 2004). In addition, through genetic studies, we have established that AGB1 and AtIRE1 independently control UPR (Chen and Brandizzi, 2012). These results are the first example of a genetic interaction between UPR regulators in plants (Chen and Brandizzi, 2012).\nThrough a collaborative effort with colleagues in the US and South America, the UPR mutants generated in our lab have been used to provide evidence for an involvement of the two AtIRE1 isoforms in the activation of the transcription factor bZIP60 in response to chemically-induced stress, as well as to pathogens (Moreno et al., 2012).\nIn a separate effort, we have also gathered evidence that the UPR is activated in conditions of changed gravity. Pursuing this aspect of the research is our current priority in a new NASA award to our lab (Grant/Cooperative Agreement Number: NNX12AN71G).\nFinally, in collaboration with Dr. S. Howell (Iowa State Univ.), we have also characterized the determinants necessary for the trafficking and activation of a membrane tethered transcription factor in response to stress (Srivastava et al., 2012).\nTogether our efforts are providing fundamental insights in the understanding of the regulatory network for growth as well as for stress sensing and response in plants.\nOur award has led to the publication of three peer-reviewed manuscripts in top  journals (Chen and Brandizzi, 2012; Moreno et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2012) as well as to the training of a PhD student, Ms. Yani Chen (graduation Spring 2013).\nLiterature (* indicates publications from this award):\n*Chen, Y., and Brandizzi, F.

            "task_description": "The broad working hypothesis underlying the work we are reporting on here is that in space, the mechanical unloading caused by microgravity can affect the growth and regenerative health of a broad range of mammalian tissues. Conversely, we also hypothesized that normal gravity on earth activates a key, complex cell-signaling pathway responsible for maintaining normal regenerative tissue growth, the extracellular matrix(ECM)-integrin-kinase signaling pathway.\nThe work we proposed was centered on the specific hypothesis that somatic stem cells responsible for tissue regeneration may require the mechanical stimulation of gravity to proliferate and differentiate, and to regenerate tissues at normal rates, and that microgravity may slow down tissue regenerative processes. Specifically we sought to investigate the role of gravity-generated forces in promoting tissue regeneration, and the molecular mechanisms by which gravity in stem cells is translated into proliferation and differentiation. During the course of the proposed work we had the opportunity to expand ground artificial gravity studies to microgravity during rapid turnaround spaceflight opportunities in the Space Tissue Loss (STL1) and (STL2) experiments with stem cell differentiation.   This work was integrated in the ongoing grant research expanding the artificial gravity approach to the questions to also include microgravity.\nSpecifically we aimed to broadly test the hypotheses that:\n1)\tGravity-dependent mechanical loading regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in the in-vivo newt tail regeneration model\n2)\t Gravity-dependent mechanical-load signaling in somatic stem cell progenitors regulates their proliferation and differentiation in-vitro\nIn addressing Aim 1, we determined that in the newt tail regeneration model, varying gravity mechanotransduction from microgravity to hypergravity does play an important role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of somatic stem cell progenitors present in the newt tail blastema, determining the extent of tail regeneration and whether progenitor stem cells switch from an early proliferative state into a late, functional, differentiated state, validating our hypothesis for in-vivo tissue regeneration, and suggesting that to the extent that normal tissue regenerative processes in mammals are analogous to newt tail regeneration, that they too will likely be dependent on gravity mechanical loading to occur normally, and that microgravity will inhibit them. This conclusion offers a strong note of caution about long-term human exposure to microgravity, suggesting that organ systems and tissues dependent on somatic stem cell-based regeneration for normal health will likely fail to work normally, possibly resulting in significant tissue and organ degeneration.   In addition our in-vitro studies with mouse embryonic stem cells also, and in particular the microgravity spaceflight component of this grant with the STL1 and STL2 experiments with mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation into embryoid bodies and keratinocytes, offered similar conclusions with added molecular mechanism details.  Specifically we observed the inhibition of stem cell differentiation and failure of numerous molecular markers of tissue differentiation to occur in microgravity, and the persistence of stem cell markers that should normally switch off in response to initiation of differentiation plus large decreases in expression of cell adhesion and signaling molecules in the matrix-integrin-kinase axis.  Overall the work we conducted using live animals, as well as cellular and molecular approaches consistently shows mechanical load is required for stem cells to differentiate and function in tissue regeneration, and that microgravity inhibits this process.  Future work is needed to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms linking gravity to tissue regeneration.\nBelow we specifically report on Aim 1 under the title “Gravity Mechanical Load Modulates Tissue Growth and Regeneration in the Newt  Pleurodeles waltl” on the work pertaining to the newt tail regeneration in-vivo model in hypergravity, and on results from the Foton M3 spaceflight experiment we analyzed in the context of this grant as part of obtaining results for tissue regeneration going from unloaded condition in aquaria, and microgravity, as well as under normal load at 1g and hypergravity at 2g.  In total these results offer a very complete picture of responses to varying regenerative responses to increasing load, and of the importance and necessity of gravity for normal tissue regenerative processes.\nIn addition we also report on Aim 2 results under the title “Microgravity Reduces the Proliferation, Differentiation, and Regenerative Potential of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells” on the cell biology work pertaining to the in-vitro stem cell regeneration model based on induction of differentiation under mostly microgravity conditions, but also hypergravity. The cell biology results clearly show a gravity-dependent switch between stem cells and their functional differentiated descendents, and suggest microgravity is a strong inhibitor of regenerative processes.\nNOTE: This proposal has a companion spaceflight component entitled, \"The Effects of Microgravity on the Tissue Regenerative Potential of Stem Cells--Flight.\"  The spaceflight experiments are relevant to Aim 2.  Having completed the initial data analysis of the STL2-SCR flight experiments conducted on STS-135, and for context, we also report here on the companion flight proposal progress and results.\nNOTE that the Flight and Ground portions of the project were combined in April 2011 for reporting purposes (Ed. 7/11/2011).",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "We believe the studies underway in this project are highly relevant to NASA because the hypothesis we are testing test, if validated, will be of key importance to understanding and maintenance of human tissue regenerative homeostasis and health during long-term spaceflight.  The data we have already obtained in complementary spaceflight and ground studies clearly and reproducibly show that tissue regeneration in animal and cell models is significantly slower in space, and that gravity-generated forces are of key importance to stimulate the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of cells and tissues.  In this study we asked the specific question of whether tissue regeneration in vivo, in the newt tail regeneration model, and regenerative somatic stem cell models, in vitro respond to hypergravity with increased regenerative proliferation, and if so by what molecular signaling mechanisms.  These questions are of key importance because hypergravity in space is thought to be one of the few methods capable of compensating for the degenerative tissue conditions now know to be induced by long-term spaceflight.  The results obtained in this grant thus far, with stem cell and newt tail regeneration experiments under hypergravity conditions, strongly support our initial hypothesis.  The in-vivo newt tail regeneration in particular, for the first time shows vertebrate tissue regeneration being enhanced by gravity stimulation.  In addition, companion spaceflight experiments in the STS-131 STL-SCR and STS-135-STL2-SCR,  studying stem cell growth and differentiation, also point to microgravity as causing a failure of differentiation of tissue precursor cells in embryoid bodies and keratinocytes.  In conclusion, this study shows promise of having great impact in this field by providing specific answers to the important question of whether and how gravity can promote regenerative proliferation and differentiation in relevant cell and animal models of regeneration.  These novel insights into the potentially broad role of adult stem cell health in spaceflight-induced tissue degenerative conditions are likely to be an important factor in shaping the direction of future approaches to health during spaceflight, as well as being translated into medical advances in tissue regenerative health."

            "task_progress": "During the last reporting period from 2011 to 2012 we focused our efforts on completing testing the hypothesis elaborated in  Aim 2 of the grant proposal, that stem cells responsible for tissue regeneration have their proliferation and differentiation affected by gravity mechanostimulation.  Specifically we had already tested in the previous year the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into embryo-like cell massses (embryoid bodies) of various lineages and specific types and had found that microgravity inhibited the transition from stem cells to differentiated tissues, and that gravity mechanostimulation promoted it, as indicated both by gene expression and cell biology studies of differentiation markers and cell function.  Those studies however, were not a of a specific cell type, so for the Space Tissue Loss 2 experiment flight opportunity on STS-135 we chose and proposed  to study microgravity effects on keratinocyte differentiation from embryonic stem cells.  The choice of keratinocyte differentiation as a model to study the effects of microgravity versus 1g on stem cell differentiation addresses the key question in Aim 2 of our proposal for a specific cell type, which was not possible with the mixed-lineage embryoid body model flown on STL1, and in addition addresses the important issue of wound closure by keratinocytes  in microgravity.  To do this, we used the time period between April and July 2011 to develop and ground verify the spaceflight protocol for differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into keratinocytes, and after this testing was completed we successfully flew the STL2 keratinocyte experiment on the final space shuttle mission, STS-135.\nSpecifically, for the cell culture flight experiments, we used hollow fiber bioreactors seeded with stem cells and initiated differentiation immediately prior to flight with specific growth and transcription factors and cell culture medium to induce keratinocyte differentiation.  After 15 days spaceflight and just prior to landing a set of flight bioreactors was fixed in space with RNA later to preserve mRNA, while another set was brought back to earth for live cell functional assays, such as cell migration in an vitro wound-healing assay.  In the period following the flight we conducted ground based sample preparation qPCR analysis of  gene expression and of post-flight cell cultures  The analyses performed also included migration quantification on wound healing assays, and histocytochemistry.  As a result of these studies we already determined that keratinocytes differentiated in microgravity with altered expression of keratins and reduced migratory ability, suggesting that differentiation and function of keratinocytes in wound closure would be diminished in microgravity.\nFinally, to complete the studies on stem cell proliferation and gene expression in response to gravity mechanostimulation we conducted cell culture centrifugation studies of mouse embryonic stem cells at 1g vs 25g.  In these studies we observed no alterations in proliferation as we had previously observed in differentiated osteoprecursors, suggesting that stem cells and later stage progenitor lineages respond to mechanical stimulation in different ways.  Our gene expression studies suggest that in stem cells  gravity mechanostimulation affects differentiation and stemness markers while leaving proliferation regulators unchanged.  We are currently preparing the results from these studies for publication.",

We have used genetically engineered plants and molecular tools to monitor plant responses to spaceflight and space-related analog environments and have developed specific hypotheses regarding plant signaling responses that are affected by spaceflight. The focus of this proposal is to build on these extensive insights to develop the next generation of biological assays and hardware concepts to address these hypotheses in ground and analog studies. In the process, these new biological and analytical tools will be integrated into functional concepts than can be readied for future deployment in a range of spaceflight-related opportunities. The biology will include new biosensors to test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which molecular signals are conveyed in response to spaceflight and analog environments. Some biosensors will be linked to Green Fluorescent Protein variants to facilitate multiplexed telemetric data collection.

            "task_progress": "Overview and Objectives – a Synopsis\nDuring spaceflight, plants experience growth and developmental conditions that are distinctly unlike the terrestrial environment that has directed the evolution of gene expression patterns that ensure survival. Plants must therefore interpret novel stimuli, integrate new solutions and express potentially unusual suites of genes in an attempt to cope with spaceflight environments. Some of these responses might be directly interpretable as appropriate responses that clearly inform science of the stresses induced by spaceflight. Other responses might be confused or inappropriate due to the novel signals or biological processes present in the milieu of the spaceflight environment. Defining both kinds of responses is critical to understanding biological response and adaptation to all kinds of extraterrestrial environments, from vehicles in orbit to lunar habitats.\nOur objective is to answer fundamental questions regarding the metabolic and molecular response of plants to novel, spaceflight relevant, environments. In the current project we build on extensive insights gained from spaceflight and analog experiments to develop new biological tools and to guide hardware development to study the response to these environments with higher fidelity and wider scope. The biology will include new biosensors created to dissect the mechanisms by which molecular signals are conveyed and integrated into responses to spaceflight environments. Some biosensors will be linked to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) spectral variants to facilitate telemetric data collection, which will in turn enable robust robotic experiments with wide deployment options. The hardware to support this telemetric science, will be advanced in concept to include multiple spectral capacities in order to monitor multiple biosensor reporter genes simultaneously. The focus is on advancing telemetric imaging that will enable the potential future deployment of such biosensor-units in a wide range of potential spaceflight applications - ISS, crew vehicles, satellites and lunar or Mars packages - as the opportunities present. These experiments address the need to understand the biological response of eukaryotes to spaceflight, and other novel environments at the molecular and cellular level, with special focus on signaling pathways and gene expression.\nSummary\nFocus and Opportunities\nThe final year of the grant continued to help support people and efforts for additional characterizations of returned Flight materials from the PIs’ two Flight Experiments: APEX-TAGES and BRIC-16, as well as contributing to the support of ancillary analyses associated with the BRIC-17 returned material. Space Biology support enabled an additional level of analyses of these samples, and facilitated supplemental ground studies that continue to contribute to our understanding of the response of biology to spaceflight and novel environments. The data analyses led to the design and support of several analog studies initiated last year: 1) clinorotation and gravity vector disruption, including root skewing analyses in inclined planes, 2) hypergravity tests with a 2-3g centrifuge, and 3) a parabolic flight campaign opportunity and suborbital flight preparations in high performance aircraft (in support of two FO awards).\nThe concomitant ground and flight support represented by these grants enables us to combine the processes of flight biology preparation, flight data analysis, and hypothesis development and testing for unprecedented insight into biological responses to these novel environments.  The execution of this grant was (and continues to be) the ideal example of what NASA intended as the role of Space Biology Ground-Based Research: NRA-01-OBPR-06 “…to expand our understanding of fundamental biological processes and the mechanisms by which these processes sense, respond, adapt to, and evolve in the space environment…and in particular… the role of the genome and cellular structures in sensing and responding to gravitational force.”\nThe final year of the grant had several foci:\nUndifferentiated cells - cell sensing and signal transduction:   The results of the BRIC-16 experiment (see FSB 2012 report and related BRIC-16 report) revealed that undifferentiated cells can detect the spaceflight environment and altered gravity in the absence of differentiated tissue or organized developmental structures (Paul et al. 2012: BMC Plant Biology. 12:232\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/12/232\n, Zupanska et al. 2013: American Journal of Botany. 100:235-248). One of the most striking results was the engagement of “heat shock” and protein chaperone genes The results from the tissue culture experiments leads us to further dissect the sensory and signal mechanism(s) that cell cultures use to detect and respond to spaceflight. To further address these questions, we started a series of ground experiments to test signal transduction pathways in unit gravity, and to also stage out biological tools for future flight opportunities.  We initiated several new tissue culture lines, some of them containing GFP reporters, and others that are deficient in key chaperone genes.  Experiments with cultures carrying known mutations that are well characterized in the gravity sensation and signaling of intact plants will provide insight into the mechanisms behind those processes. If cell cultures are using these typical sensing and signaling elements, the mutations should greatly attenuate the cell culture responses\nReporter gene line development:   The results of the APEX-01 / TAGES and the BRIC 16 experiment revealed that a large number of genes were differentially expressed in response to the spaceflight environment (Paul et al. 2012: BMC Plant Biology. 12:232\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/12/232\n; Paul et al 2013: BMC Plant Biology. 13:112\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/112\n).  These results initiated the development of a variety of new GFP-reporter gene lines to support spaceflight applications.\nBiosensors in calcium-signaling mutant backgrounds:   A number of reporters were developed in calcium signaling mutant backgrounds; two lines show differential expression of the reporter gene in plants deficient in aspects of calcium signaling.\nQuality testing of flight hardware:   This grant helped to support the bio-compatibility testing of two types of spaceflight hardware under consideration, the Aluminum PDFUs for future BRIC experiments, and a new ceramic foam sponge for the ABRS plant biology growth chamber.\nParabolic flight campaigns (Zero-G):   This Space Biology grant contributed to the support of several parabolic flight campaigns that were awarded through the Flight Opportunities Office.  Since FO does not provide operations support, it is essential that the PIs have some other source of NASA funding to support the personnel and analyses. Our NASA NNX09AL96G grant was the foundation of this support, and crucial for our success.\nPerformance aircraft for Sub-orbital application:   The other un-supported Flight Opportunity Award received by the PIs is for a series of suborbital flights. This Space Biology grant also contributed to the support of preparations for the suborbital FO by conducting hardware and biology tests in high performance aircraft (T6 and F104).\nConcluding remarks:   We have accomplished an amazing amount of diverse, spaceflight-related science with this grant. Having this support has allowed us to develop a large range of biological and engineering tools to support four flight experiments, three parabolic flight campaigns, and enhance the technical readiness of our upcoming suborbital flight opportunity – all while conducting novel, fundamental ground-based research that expands the communities understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the spaceflight acclimation of plants. This research funding contributed to 16 publications over its lifetime, and to the support of three PhD students (Anne Visscher, Eric Schultz, Natasha Sng), three undergraduates (Lauren Frizzle, Justin Goodwyn, Zackary Guignardi), four postdoctoral associates (Agata Zupanska, Fiona Denison, Matthew Bamsey, Thomas Graham), and two biological scientists (Claire Amalfitano, Lawrence Rasmussen).",

Changes in proliferation, differentiation, and genetic expression have been demonstrated in several types of cells (reviewed in Cogoli 1996, Cogoli and Greuter 1997). Among the mammalian cells, the cells of the immune system, in particular, are severely affected by the space environment. Especially T-lymphocytes are altered in their activation process. Change in growth rate, cytokine production, locomotion, gene expression, and PKC distribution have been observed on Space Shuttle flights (Tipton et al. 1996, Pellis et al. 1997, Cogoli-Greuter et al. 1997, Hatton et al. 1999, Lewis et al. 2001).\nAt the beginning of the space research, the experiments are based on simple question with answers like “yes/no”; at the present time the knowledge on the signal transduction mechanisms are progressing rapidly and the research is orienting to answer deeper questions about regulation pathways and to get a better understanding at the molecular level. Moreover, the laboratory techniques have evolved greatly. Sub-populations of T-cells can be isolated from peripheral blood, the expression of specific genes can be measured, and signal pathways can be specifically activated. This allows studying more complex and subtle reactions in cells biology.\nThe goal of this proposal is to study, thanks to these new methods, the finer regulation of lymphocyte activation, especially at the level of the cytokines IL-2, IL-1, and their receptors using different activation pathways.   The specific objectives are to further investigate, using several activators, the genetic expression of the co-stimulatory transduction pathway mediated by the CD28, to assess whether the IL-1 receptor is involved in the inhibition of the activation, to see if the activation is also restored in space as it is in simulated microgravity using anti-CD3/IL-2, and to determine which genes are then expressed under these special conditions.  Microgravity will be used as an inhibitor of activation without having to use chemicals putatively damaging the cells. The main hypothesis to be tested is whether the restoring of the activation under the specific anti-CD3/IL-2 activation is due to a restoring of the receptor (IL-2R and/or IL-1R) gene expression. Correlated aspects such as the expression of early oncogenes and the production cytokines and their receptor will also be studies. The experiment will be based on an on-going ground-based research using the RPM as the main tool.",

Our studies are aimed at understanding the molecular defect of the T cell that suppresses activation during microgravity.

These targets will include those that enhance T cell function as well as targets to blunt immune function to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus and Rheumatoid arthritis."

The effects of microgravity on genotoxic response is important because NASA astronauts and personnel in microgravity will be exposed to significant genotoxic agents including chemicals (e.g. metals) and radiation and the potential for microgravity to exacerbate  the genotoxic outcome is poorly understood. The short term objective of this research is to initially focus on chromium (Cr) because it is one of the only metals with a well-established DNA repair response to genotoxicity that is also a component of lunar soil. We will investigate the central hypothesis that altered gravity potentiates metal ion- and particle-induced genotoxicity. We will test this  hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) Determine Altered Gravity Effects on Metal-induced DNA Damage Formation and Repair in Human Cells and 2) Determine if Altered Gravity Effects Are Conserved Across Cell Types and Species. These data when combined with our data generated by our studies of lunar dust in cells at normal gravity can be used to help determine appropriate exposure  limits to moon dust. Our data will also be the first to evaluate how altered gravity affects metal-induced DNA repair gene expression and signal transduction as well as effects on metal-induced apoptosis. These data will also indicate which responses are general and which are cell or species specific. Altogether, these data should provide important insight into the mechanisms of altered gravity on  metal-induced genotoxicity and suggest possible approaches for potential countermeasures.",

            "task_progress": "Summary of Research:\nTo study the microgravity effect on cells, we developed a protocol for growing cells on microcarriers. We experimented different types of microcarrier beads, amount of microcarrier beads, cell type, seeding density of cells, types of environment to grow the cells on microcarriers (rocking or still), type of trypsin, trypsin time length, and type of rinse to produce the highest number of  metaphases (metaphase index) during a chromosome harvest. These optimization experiments were done for both human lung and skin fibroblast cells (WTHBF-6, and BJhTERT, respectively).  Once optimal growth and reagents were determined we were able to test growth of cells in simulated microgravity using the High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARV) culture vessel bioreactor system. Based on previous studies, a rotation speed of 23 rpm was chosen to allow the cells to be in suspension while avoiding excessive centrifugal force.\nQuantify the effect of microgravity on Cr(VI)-induced genotoxicity\nOnce all of these parameters were established we were able to begin genotoxicity studies. We found that cells grown on microcarriers and rotated at 23 rpm had less damage than cells grown at normal gravity under normal culture conditions. These data contradicted our previous data showing an increase in chromosome damage when microgravity was simulated by parabolas in a plane. We found that this difference was not due to cells growing on microcarrier beads.\nBecause we saw more damage in flight, it occurred to us that we may not be properly modeling microgravity with a setting of 23 rpm. With the wide range of speed settings on the HARV culture vessel rotating base it is possible rotational speed may play a role in the chromosome damage results at 23 rpm in the previous experiments.  To test for this we conducted experiments at 8 rpm.  This speed is significantly slower than the 23 rpm speed used previously, but is still able to grow and maintain cells as demonstrated in previous studies (4-6).  According to Hammond, 2001, as the rotation approaches zero the spirals of the HARV culture vessels are so large that the particles make one nearly continuous wall impact (6).  At high rotation speeds, wall impacts increase again due to centrifugal forces (7).  We found that sodium chromate induces even less damage at lower speed, further contradicting our flight data.\nWe next considered that there could be an effect on Cr uptake.  Our flight data showed less Cr uptake in microgravity leading to more damage. Thus, in order to further explain the possible differences seen in the amount of damage in cells treated in microgravity versus normal gravity, we conducted chemical uptake experiments to determine if the difference in damage was due to a difference in chromium uptake under differing gravity conditions. We found that cells in microgravity take up less chromium than cells under normal gravity conditions in human lung cells. These data were consistent with our flight data. When the chromosome damage data are considered based on Cr uptake we found that the amount of chromium-induced chromosome damage remains higher in normal gravity, in contrast to our published data of the effects of flight.\nWe also conducted experiments in human skin cells and found similar results as those found in human lung cells.\nWe conducted studies considering another Cr(VI) compound, lead chromate. Lead chromate is an insoluble form of chromate and is administered as a particle in suspension in cell cultures. There was no difference in the cytotoxic effect of lead chromate under microgravity and normal gravity conditions.\nWe used the Western blot assay to consider specific proteins involved in DNA repair signaling.  We focused on two major DNA double stand break repair proteins, Mre11 and Ku80. We chose these two proteins because DNA double strand breaks are one of the most hazardous DNA damage to the cell. Misrepaired DNA double strand breaks could lead to cancer formation. Two major repair pathways, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are involved in the repair of this damage. Mre11 is a DNA damage sensor and facilitates HR. Ku 80 recognizes and binds broken DNA ends in NHEJ. Using western blot assays we found that Cr(VI) decreases Mre11 expression in cells under normal gravity and microgravity condition. The Mre 11 level in cells under microgravity condition is similar to the cells in normal gravity. Cr(VI) does not affect Ku80 protein expression in cells under normal gravity but slightly increased Ku80 in cells under microgravity condition. These data suggest that altered gravity does not significantly change cellular DNA double strand break response.\nQuantify the effect of hypergravity on Cr(VI)-induced genotoxicity\nIn addition to working on the effects of microgravity we extended our investigation to consider the contribution of hypergravity using a centrifuge. We considered the effect of hypergravity on the cytotoxic effect of sodium chromate, a soluble form of chromium, in human lung cells. Hypergravity exacerbated the effect of sodium chromate-induced cytotoxicity at lower concentrations in lung cells; however, at the highest concentration there was no difference in effect. We also looked at these effects in human skin cells. In skin cells there was no difference in the effect of hypergravity on sodium chromate-induced cytotoxicity. We also considered the contribution of hypergravity on the genotoxic effects of sodium chromate treatment. Our data show that sodium chromate induces similar chromosome damage at low concentration but less damage at higher concentration.\nDetermine if altered gravity effects are conserved across cell types and species\nWe investigated altered gravity effects in other species, specifically in bowhead whale and medaka cells. For these cells, we focused on the effect of hypergravity. There was significant time spent in working out the correct parameters and conditions of performing the experiments. Hypergravity was simulated using a centrifuge; however, we found that the centrifuge could not generate the temperatures required for proper culture conditions of the cells. The solution to this problem was to run the experiments at room temperature which involved additional testing to ensure that these variables were not influential in the final results. Growth curves were performed in which cells were exposed to room temperature for periods of time equal to those needed for the experiments. We found that this did not affect the overall growth of the cells and thus proceeded with some simple experiments to begin our investigations. We found that the cytotoxic effect of hexavalent chromium is not exacerbated by hypergravity in bowhead whale lung cells at 10g, however when we tested these cells at 2g we found a much greater difference.\nWe also considered the effects of chromate in medaka cells. We found that, similar to human skin cells, hypergravity did not exacerbate the chromium-induced cytotoxic effect in medaka cells. We then considered the genotoxic effect of chromium in medaka cells exposed to hypergravity. There was less chromium-induced damage seen in the cells exposed to hypergravity than cells exposed to normal gravity.\nReferences:\n1.

            "task_description": "The overall goal of our program is to understand fundamental molecular biological responses to extraterrestrial environments. In that context, the goal of this proposal is to compare and contrast the gene expression responses within two forms of Arabidopsis: whole, etiolated seedlings, and undifferentiated cells in culture.\nTwo complementary types of genome-wide gene expression profiling analyses will be applied to the biological samples from both spaceflight and ground controls: Replicated DNA microarray analyses that will reveal changes in genome-wide patterns of gene expression on a platforms whose data are directly comparable to the wide range of array data available for Arabidopsis, and RNA deep sequencing, RNASeq, a relatively new, digital transcript profiling method that offers a more accurate genome-wide quantitation of transcript abundance over wider dynamic range of expression levels.\nThe baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells addresses the fundamental hypothesis of the proposal - that spaceflight is a unique and challenging environment in which survival requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells addresses a second hypothesis that cells can detect spaceflight and gravity in the absence of tissue or organized developmental structures.\nThese experiments enable us to evaluate fundamental mechanisms associated with plant responses to the novel environment of spaceflight. What gene response pathways are engaged in response to spaceflight? Are specific organs and tissues required for the detection and transduction of signals from the spaceflight environment, including gravity? Given that certain differentiated cells are often associated with the perception or signaling of environmental events, what happens when they are absent? Would gravity still exert an effect on plant cells? Can single cells perceive gravity? These key questions are recognized as fundamental within the previous decadal study and underpin some of the biggest questions in spaceflight plant biology. And while several studies have addressed gene expression in space, as yet there is no robust, replicated transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis in spaceflight. This project contains the replicates and technical sophistication to form those baseline data for seedlings and extends those data into essential questions regarding gravity and spaceflight perception by developed tissues and organs.",

            "task_progress": "Arabidopsis seedlings and cell cultures clearly respond to the spaceflight environment with changes in gene expression. Microarray, SAGE, and quantitative PCR data fully support the conclusion that Arabidopsis, whether as etiolated seedlings or undifferentiated cells, senses that it is in a modified environment and mounts changes in gene expression as a response to spaceflight. The six-fold replication of the experiment design allowed an examination of differences in gene expression down to two-fold while retaining p values <0.01, allowing a confident examination of fairly small quantitative changes in gene expression\nAt a minimum, any genes affected by gravity or orientation on Earth might be expected to be changed in spaceflight. However, the range of genes affected by spaceflight appears to span beyond those genes whose expression might be easily explained by changes in gravity, and include a number of familiar genes with roles in the response to a wide variety of environmental factors. In addition, the results of these experiments reflect relatively long term adaptive responses as the plants and cells were on orbit for twelve days before they were fixed. Thus the patterns of gene expression reflect adaptive strategies of these two forms of the plant, rather than a rapid initial response to a new stress or environment. Time course analyses of any number of stress response surveys repeatedly show that initial responses are often diminished within minutes of the application of the stress, and patterns of gene expression change as longer term adaptive strategies are engaged and maintained. Thus these spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression likely reflect changes toward longer-term survival in the spaceflight environment. Future experiments should include the initial responses to spaceflight.\nIn etiolated seedlings, the genes most highly induced by spaceflight (by five-fold or more) are almost equally divided between those associated with pathogen defense and those that are associated with environmental stress responses. Differentially regulated genes reflect categories of genes which are broadly associated with drought stress, wounding and calcium- and auxin-mediated signaling. The seedlings grew on sterile media and none experienced drought or wounding stress. The temperature was well controlled and any excursions from the Ground Control environmental profiles were minimal. The media compositions and atmospheric conditions were identical between Spaceflight and Ground Control. Therefore a direct and obvious relationship between the affected genes and a defined stress is missing.\nA possible basis for many of these responses may be traced to a translation of changes in forces associated with the cytoskeleton and cell wall. Pathogen and wounding responses are very tightly connected, as both can involve a breach of the cell wall. In the Tensegrity-based model of the gravisensing, an actin-based cytoskeletal network throughout the cytoplasm is coupled to stretch-sensitive receptors in the plasma membrane (Yoder et al., 2001). Cytoskeletal actin filaments attached to the plasma membrane, specialized proteins that contain an actin binding domain at their carboxyl terminus, and protein phosphorylation or phosphoinositide binding (Tsukita and Yonemura, 1997) have been postulated to participate in gravity related signaling (Yoder et al., 2001). It is possible that any of these signaling mechanisms by which a cell detects a breach are balanced by the force of gravity and the absence of gravity may confound the signaling system, engaging pathogen signal transduction pathways as a consequence. The presence of other stress response genes may have similar explanations; they appear inappropriate only because the foundations of the stimulus are unclear.\nAbout 20% of the up-regulated genes in seedlings do not fall obviously into either pathogen or environmental stresses. It is from among these examples that it may be possible to identify some “appropriate”, or at least adaptively meaningful, responses to the spaceflight environment. Several candidates in this category include ALF4 (Aberrant Lateral Root Formation 4), ARR7 (Response Regulator 7), and PIN3 (Pin-Formed 3), all of which are either influenced by, or play a role in auxin or cytokinin signaling, and may be impacted by changes in the gravity vector (Lomax, 1997; Friml et al., 2002; DiDonato et al., 2004; Perrin et al., 2005; Aloni et al., 2006; Harrison and Masson, 2008a).\nThe cells in culture responded in a dramatically different fashion to spaceflight than did the seedlings. While similar numbers of genes were differentially affected by spaceflight, there is almost no similarity among the identities of the genes affected. In addition, the cell cultures exhibited a greater number of highly (greater than 8-fold) differentially expressed genes. In seedlings, most of the genes differentially expressed by two-fold or more had low intrinsic signal values, while nearly all of the differentially expressed genes in cultured cells had moderate to high signal values. About one-third of the differentially expressed cell culture genes had expression levels of greater than 2000, while only four of the differentially expressed genes from seedlings were as abundant. These data suggest that cell cultures mount a more dramatic response to spaceflight, affecting more genes with higher expression levels and with greater fold change.\nNone of the genes significantly impacted by spaceflight in cultured cells were similar to those in seedlings. Even the GO categories of genes are substantially different. Cell cultures also exhibit less diversity in the types of genes which are highly induced. Pathogen and wounding, general stress response and transcription factor categories are present, as in the seedling data sets, but the genes that populate those categories differ from those induced in seedlings. The cell culture samples illustrate repression of more kinases, and fewer proteases than seedlings, but transcription factors, transporters, and cell wall associated gene categories are about equally affected – however, with different individual genes in each case.\nBy far the most dramatic molecular response to spaceflight in the cultured cells was a heat shock response, a response that was not manifested in seedlings. Genes encoding heat shock proteins, heat shock related proteins or heat shock transcription factors, comprise the majority of the genes induced greater than 8-fold and over 40% of the those induced more than five-fold.  Clearly no temperature differentials capable of classic heat shock were present between the Spaceflight samples and the Ground Control samples. Heat shock proteins are, however, generally related to responses to unfolded proteins and can be part of a variety of signal transduction pathways. It has been shown in both plants and animals that heat shock-related proteins are widely distributed in response to an assortment of abiotic stresses.  In addition to their roles as molecular chaperones that manage post-translational processes, heat shock proteins are thought to participate in the cross talk among stress response pathways, especially where an organism is exposed to multiple, concomitant stresses. Over-expression of heat shock proteins may contribute to a generalized tolerance for multiple environmental stresses (Swindell et al., 2007). In a situation involving a novel environment such as spaceflight, it is possible that a plant cell responds as if it were being exposed to multiple stressors, and the induction of heat shock proteins reflects this perception.\nThere are few previous studies to provide ground for direct comparison with the current data, yet interesting correlations emerge. Three genome-scale plant molecular space studies are published to date (Paul et al., 2005; Stutte et al., 2006; Salmi and Roux, 2008). One positive correlation is that evidence of spaceflight heat shock was seen in Arabidopsis (Paul and others 2005), albeit in light-grown seedlings quite distinct from those of the current study. Another positive, but less direct, correlation is the effect of spaceflight on the expression of genes involved in calcium signaling during fern spore development (Salmi and Roux 2008). However, there were virtually no statistically supportable changes in the patterns of gene expression between wheat for comparison (Stutte and others 2006). Genome-wide studies of the impact of spaceflight on animal systems are slightly more common, particularly for cell lines from bone-derived cultures, mice and drosophila models. While a full review of that literature is beyond the scope of this study, recent studies do demonstrate clear transcriptome differences during spaceflight, including studies of murine muscle (Allen et al., 2009) and thymus tissue (Lebsack et al., 2010). Drosophila and Caenorabditis elegans show six differentially expressed genes common to these two diverse species (Leandro et al., 2007; Adenle et al., 2009). And while the divergence of plants and animals largely prevents specific gene comparisons in spaceflight responses, certain classes of genes seem similarly affected by spaceflight. Calcium mediated signal transduction is impacted by spaceflight in both plants and animals (Hughes-Fulford et al., 1998; Hashemi et al., 1999; Paul et al., 2001; Salmi and Roux, 2008) and genes affected by calcium signaling are differentially expressed. Heat shock proteins are highly conserved in both kingdoms and heat shock genes are upregulated in some spaceflight studies. At least one of the sub-class of heat shock genes highly induced in this study (Hsp90) is also induced in mouse thymus after exposure to spaceflight (Lebsack et al., 2010). Stress also exacerbates sensitivity to pathogen attach in both plants and animals and there are common mechanisms for triggering an immune response, such as nitric oxide and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (Nurnberger et al., 2004). A number of genes associated with Drosophila immune pathways were downregulated in the spaceflight environment, and larvae were in fact more susceptible to pathogen infection (Marcu et al., 2011). Although none of the Drosophila genes in that study are orthologous to the Arabidopsis genes presented here, many of genes in the present seedling data are nonetheless associated with pathogen defense. While many more studies will be required to support informed deductions regarding commonalities in spaceflight response (especially considering the dissimilarity of biology, hardware, flight profiles, and even replicates), current data suggest that such commonalities may exist.\nThat plants and plant cells under BRIC experimental conditions respond to spaceflight with significant changes in gene expression indicate that changes in metabolism are engaged to cope with spaceflight. Spaceflight demands an adaptive response. Many of these changes make some sense with regard to the primary effects of gravity, but others suggest stresses that are not simply explained by the lack of gravity. That cultured cells respond dramatically to spaceflight in a markedly different way than seedlings, suggests that either undifferentiated cells have more biological difficulty with spaceflight or that there are technical reasons affecting the results. One possibility is that this difference between cultured cells and seedlings is due to the fact seedlings have organs with which to sense and sample their environment, and that the absence of such organs undifferentiated cells propagate inappropriate stress responses. In support of this possibility, seedlings displayed a greater abundance of differentially expressed genes associated with plant hormone signaling and gravity sensing while cultured cells did not. Another possible explanation for the differences is simply that all of the cells in the culture are responding in an identical manner, enhancing the technical observation of the response, while in seedlings different tissues are responding differently, diluting the apparent effect as induction in one tissue balances repression in another. The analysis of spaceflight effects on seedlings would benefit from recovering enough material to look at individual organs or cell types. Regardless, it remains clear that there is not an intense and simple response to spaceflight that is shared by all cell types within the differentiated cells of an intact plant.     Conclusions\nSeedlings and cell cultures both engage gene expression changes to alter metabolic responses to the spaceflight environment, but they engage dramatically different responses. This response differential between seedlings and cell cultures could be as simple as a consequence of examining a very uniformly responding system in undifferentiated cells compared to a complex organism composed of differentiated organs and tissues. Or, it could be as complex of the presence of an organ-specific feedback sense and response system that allows seedlings, but not undifferentiated cells, to more properly sense the environment and integrate a response that makes sense based on input from organ systems. Regardless, it clear that even undifferentiated plant cells sense spaceflight as an environment that demands molecular responses. Many of those responses tap familiar pathways - auxin, calcium signaling, stress – and there is a tendency to place those responses into familiar earth-based context. But given the truly novel nature of spaceflight, responses may propagate in ways that are distinct from well-defined terrestrial analogs.\nAdditional details can be found in publication: Paul A-L, Zupanska A, Ostrow DT, Zhang Y, Sun Y, Li J-L, Shanker S, Farmerie WG, Amalfitano CE, Ferl RJ (2012) Spaceflight transcriptomes: unique responses to a novel environment.

Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. When completed, this study will yield critical insight into how mechanosensitive channels sense and respond to membrane tension.\nProgress:  Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels that directly transduce mechanical stimuli are thought to underlie diverse physiological functions such as the senses of touch, hearing, proprioception, gravity sensing, and osmoregulation. Although the molecular entities of most eukaryotic MS channels still remain elusive, their bacterial counterparts have been extensively studied and thus serve today as paradigms for MS channels. Hence, we use these channels to study the mechanisms of how mechanosensors sense and interact with their lipid environment. This study has allowed us to determine some of the dynamics of these interactions upon channel stimulation and opening.\nThe mechanosensitive channels of large conductance, MscL, and of smaller conductance, MscS, are the two major MS channels in bacteria. They effect a coordinated response to hypo-osmotic shock, serving as emergency release valves for the rapid flux of fluid and solutes. MscL from E. coli was the first to be identified, and is perhaps the best studied mechanosensor from any species. A crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis MscL has been solved, revealing a pentameric structure in a nearly-closed pore of about 4 Å. An extremely large conformational change of this protein must occur to achieve the open pore size of 30 Å estimated by conductance (the amount of ions that pass through the pore in a unit of time) and by molecular sieving experiments. Several models of the gating of MscL have been proposed to explain the drastic structural rearrangements to transition from the closed to open states. Although the models differ in details, all agree that a thinning of the channel in the plane of the membrane, accompanied by the tilting of the transmembrane domains, are necessary to allow the pentamer to achieve an open pore structure. Both of these arrangements require dynamic interactions between regions of the protein and lipids.\nSince X-ray crystallography of integral membrane proteins typically provide little information on their interactions with the surrounding lipids, other techniques have been used to address this issue for MscL. Utilizing some of these approaches, the second transmembrane span (TM2) of E. coli MscL, which faces the lipid membrane, has been defined. Five amino acids after the predicted end of TM2 there is a cluster of charged residues (RKKEE), which appear to be important for channel function; one E. coli MscL study showed that a C-terminal deletion at this point leads to non-functional channels, while another suggested that it serves as a pH sensor by changing the conformation of the region, and it was also suggested to interact with anionic phospholipids. Interestingly, analogous structures with a series of charged amino acids distal to the cytoplasmic transmembrane helix has been noted in other MS channel families. Hence, this region, just cytoplasmic of TM2, is a prime candidate to be involved in the dynamic lipid-protein interactions that occur during MscL gating.\nThe project was basically to utilize an in vivo screen approach to determine areas that may be dynamic within the membrane. Basically, we utilized a library of individual cysteine mutations throughout the protein. Cysteine is unique in that it is reactive to sulfhydryl reagents. Thus, you can post-translationally modify any residue. Here we used modifiers that made the region more hydrophobic, i.e. wanting to go into the membrane. The assumption is that certain regions will normally go into the membrane upon activation of sensor; by forcing this region into the membrane, we may artificially cause the channel to be activated. We know from several other experiments that if this occurs in a living cell, it causes the cell to be less viable or die. Therefore, we can use this as a screen. The modifying reagents we used are: DMTS, which adds a fatty acid chain and would be very aggressive in burying the region within the membrane; MTSBn, which adds what equates to a phenylalanine to the site; and 4-HB-MTS, which is the same as previous but contains a polar hydroxyl group, thus adding what equates to a tyrosine.\nIn the prior years, we screened the available cysteine mutants, and generated additional cysteine mutants. In the last year, we finished the screening of the newly generated cysteine mutants, evaluated the data from the entire screen, and performed secondary screens on the “hits” that allow us to determine if the modifications lead to an overactive (gain-of-function; GOF) or dysfunctional (loss-of-function; LOF) sensor.\nIn the past year we have acknowledged NASA funding in three publications, have two more in press, and have a manuscript in preparation. One of the in press manuscripts is a minireview in the Biophysical Journal entitled “Sensing and responding to membrane tension: the bacterial MscL channel as a model system”. NASA funding is acknowledged, and some of the data from this project figures prominently within the review.\nThe data have provided a glimpse at how a mechanosensor dynamically interacts with the lipid membrane. Notably, the results of this project led to the finding that one residue appears to enter the lipid membrane in a piston-like manner upon sensor activation.",

These studies will focus on the use of Ceratopteris richardii as a model system for gravity sensing. We will focus on the initial mechanoreceptors associated with the trans-cellular calcium current, and will seek to identify the specific membrane component (pumps and channels) associated with these early electrophysiological events using molecular and biochemical approaches. Based on preliminary work we have identified two different annexins and a Ca2+-ATPase as central elements in controlling the gravity-directed flow of calcium through single-celled spores of Ceratopteris. Our project will utilize new technology for advanced-throughput cell electrophysiology, based on novel microfabricated silicon microdevices. We will use this established new method to measure transcellular calcium signaling to further characterize the biophysical properties of gravity sensing and signaling. We are specifically interested in determining how altering the secondary signal transduction signaling events (NO and cGMP) may feedback and control cell responsiveness by altering the primary calcium current. We also will combine the molecular and biophysical approaches in experiments that alter specific gene activities and measure calcium current activities using the lab-on-a-chip systems.\nThe proposed work utilizes a dynamic approach that combines modern molecular cell biology with new advanced-throughput tools for cell physiology, based on silicon microfabricated biosensing. We envision that this will lead to spaceflight experiments that utilize microsatellite opportunities, based on the second generation of the lab-on-a-chip concept. This is based on a centrifugal disk, that will accommodate a variable gravity experiment on orbit. This flight experiment will allow us to directly measure and assay the threshold value for graviperception in the single-cell spores, by directly measuring the transcellular calcium current at variable gravity levels.",

            "task_progress": "[Editor's note 1/17/2013: No Task Book report received. Progress section and Bibliography compiled from PI's Final Technical Report.]\nThe haploid spore of the fern Ceratopteris richardii is an important single cell plant model for studying gravity sensing at the molecular level.  Recent research shows that a transcellular Ca2+current is associated with the gravity vector during the time that cell polarity is being established. Treatment with Nifedipine, a known Ca2+ channel blocker, blocks this current and randomizes cell polarity (Chaterjee et al., 2000).  Additionally, temporal Ca2+ flux measurements at multiple locations around the spore are required to understand the correlation between Ca2+ flux directionality and rhizoid growth within the spore model (ul Haque et al., 2006, 2007).  Existing biosensing technologies, including the self-referencing technology, are limited to temporal and spatial constraints that prohibit the continuous measurements of Ca2+ fluxes at multiple cell membrane locations around multiple cells (Porterfield et al., 2000; Smith et al., 1998).  This ability is necessary to further study the mechanism for directing the Ca2+ current and to perform advanced experiment in NASA flight experiments.\nWe have developed a second generation cell electrophysiology lab-on-a-chip, (i.e. the CEL-C2 biochip), to investigate the gravity-sensing mechanism of Ceratopteris richardii spores. The CEL-C2 biochip overcomes the spatial and temporal constraints of previous biosensor designs by offering continuous multiplexed sensing of Ca2+ flux with 15 pyramidal wells (each holding 1 cell).  Ion-selective electrodes that extend into the four walls of the pyramidal wells provide four-point Ca2+ current-selective recordings. We improved upon our previous CEL C biochip designs by replacing the Ag/AgCl electrodes with Pt/PEDOT:CaSO4 electrodes.  The hydrophilic Ag/AgCl layer previously utilized prevented the formation of an interfacial aqueous layer, causing drift in the Nernstian calibration slope after prolonged biochip storage in ion-rich solution.  This improvement in integrated reference electrode design reduces electrical noise during Ca2+ flux monitoring and substantially enhances the biosensor lifetime.  Furthermore, the PEDOT:PSS transducer layer provides potentiometric stability with change in temperature and can withstand prolonged storage in liquid medium environment. In summary this work highlights the advantages of the improved CEL C2 biochip system in comparison to its predecessor.\nThe results of our characterization of the CEL C2 biochips showed improved performance in terms of stable Nernstian response from four-point electrodes of each wells, and between electrodes of different biochips (e.g. average Nernstian slope of 29 mV/decade of Ca2+ for all electrodes, with minor drift in the slope after prolonged storage time in ion-rich solution).  It also has increased stability in calcium concentration measurements due to longer conductive polymer conjugate transducer lifetime in comparison to a AgCl layer.  Continuous recordings of Ca2+ from C. richardii fern spores show peak signal after 8-10 hrs of germination.  We demonstrate that these recordings are repeatable and reproducible.\nAlthough this work specifically compares the technology of multiple cell recordings between the second and the first generation CEL C biochips, we anticipate that the CEL C2 biochip with improved stability and robustness could be broadly applied to measure other cell types.  This enables pharmacological measurement to be conducted in a lab-on-a-chip format.  This further has implications in biomedical, pharmacological, and space biology research.  The small size and multiplexed sensing capability of the CEL C2 biochip is conducive to space biology and thus can be potentially used for astronaut health monitoring.",

This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the ISS with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis.  In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.\nThese experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry.  Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.\nA significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS.  This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars.  Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.",

These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture.  In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth."

(2)\tTo investigate the relationship between light and gravity by measuring thresholds in fractional gravity.   (3)\tTo determine whether the red light effect on blue-light-based phototropism is a direct or indirect effect.\nIn this past year, we have defined this space project now termed \"Seedling Growth.\" The flight experiments presented in this document were taken from the ILSR-2009-1177 (PI: Dr. J Kiss) and ILSR-2009-0932 (PI: FJ Medina) proposals. Both PIs have adapted their proposal to combine their studies to maximize the science returns from the flights in response to the recommendation from NASA and European Space Agency (ESA).\nThe combined experiments will be divided into four parts (to be confirmed in negotiations with NASA/ESA and the PIs) in order to maximize the science returns from the original proposals. The experiments are to be carried out with 3+1 flights in series. The first three flight experiments are designed to accomplish specific aims enumerated in the proposals.  The last flight experiment is to be finalized to confirm and/or extend the findings from the three flight results.\nParts I & II of the flight studies are supported by NASA cooperation with ESA, and Parts III & IV are supported by ESA with cooperation from NASA.",

This information can then be used to curtail harmful activities of microbial consortia thriving as biofilms on the International Space Station and for the long-term success of human space exploration. Bacterial biofilms were abundant on the MIR space station and were responsible for increasing corrosion and blocking a water purification system. Health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are also of great concern, including increased rates of infection due to the enhanced survival of organisms within biofilms and increased resilience of biofilm populations to antimicrobial compounds.  Furthermore, experiments with Escherichia coli have indicated that biofilms formed under microgravity may have even higher levels of resistance to antimicrobials. We propose to study how gravity alters biofilm formation with the goal of developing new strategies to reduce their impact on the operation of spacecrafts and the health of their crew. We will focus on two model microorganisms that form biofilms both inside and outside of the human body, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. These microbes can switch between benign and pathogenic interactions with humans and may be relevant to crew health during extended missions. This project consists of a set of experiments to study biofilm formation during spaceflight that were conducted on Space Shuttle flight STS-135, which launched in July 2011. We examined how the formation and the three-dimensional structures of biofilms formed by these microbes differ in spaceflight compared to normal gravity. We will employ newly developed, non-leaching, nanotechnology-based, antimicrobial surfaces to aid in assessing differences between biofilm formation and structure in normal and microgravity and to assess their potential to reduce the impact of biofilms in future spacecraft designs.\nNOTE that this is the Flight portion of project entitled, \"Gravitational effects on quorum sensing and biofilm formation\" and a follow-up set of experiments to those conducted aboard STS-132.",

A very fast response to stress is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by intracellular oxidation. Space flight is associated with increased oxidative damage after return to 1 g, suggesting that microgravity and/or the transition between gravity fields triggers a response.\nWe propose to use a model organism used previously for space flight, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Studies in both hyper- and microgravity have already established many of the physiological alterations, and work from our own laboratory suggests that oxidative stress is implicated in the molecular response under both conditions. We will use hypergravity as a test environment for gravity alterations, and to dissect out molecular and cellular responses as well as long-term physiological outcomes.\nThe goal is to provide a complete picture of the oxidative stress pathway in hypergravity, and to determine and select the key molecular functions and physiological read-outs to be tested in microgravity.\nThe aims are to quantify gravity-dependent cellular ROS production and to determine the key points of entry into the oxidative pathway by using mutants that show a physiologically  altered response to hypergravity.  This approach will give a picture of the stress pathway, starting from fast cellular changes triggered by sudden changes in the gravity vector, to tissue-specific gene and enzyme activity alterations.\nUnderstanding the stress pathway in hypergravity opens the venue into looking at the opposite transition in the gravity load, from 1 g to microgravity during space flight, and will help predict the cellular and physiological response to other stresses imposed by the space environment.",

This proposed project builds on our previous ground-based and spaceflight research using the model plant Arabidopsis. Thus, the specific aims of this proposed flight research using the BRIC-LED system are: (1) to investigate plastid position in statocytes (gravity-perceiving cells) in microgravity; (2) to determine the effect of microgravity on the actin cytoskeletal organization in gravity-perceiving cells; (3) to study microgravity effects on actin cytoskeleton-related gene expression in plant cells. This project also will allow us to directly correlate results from cytological investigations and gene profiling in order to understand the nature of the actin cytoskeleton in mechanisms of gravity perception.\nThis proposed research focuses on the effects of gravity on basic cellular mechanisms and processes in plants, so it is relevant to the emphasis on using Arabidopsis as a model system in developmental biology highlighted in the current NRA. The PI's group has extensive experience with the use of Arabidopsis in experiments on the Space Shuttle and the ISS. Preliminary data on the growth of seedlings in the BRIC-LED system and from the gene profiling studies performed during our recent experiments on the ISS are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed project. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this research is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.",

We investigated the effects of microgravity on the growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Landsberg)  in a spaceflight experiment.  These studies were performed using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware system in the middeck region of the Space Shuttle during mission STS-131 in April 2010.  Seedlings were grown on nutrient agar in Petri dishes in BRIC hardware under dark conditions and then were fixed in-flight with paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or RNAlater®.  Although the long-term objective was to study the role of the actin cytoskeleton in gravity perception, in this paper, we focus on the analysis of morphology of seedlings that developed in microgravity.  While previous spaceflight studies noted deleterious morphological effects due to the accumulation of ethylene gas, no such effects were observed in seedlings grown using the BRIC system. Seed germination was 89% in the spaceflight experiment and 91% in the ground control, and seedlings grew equally well in both conditions.  However, roots of space-grown seedlings exhibited a significant difference (compared to the ground controls) in overall growth patterns in that they skewed to one direction.  In addition, a greater number of adventitious roots formed from the axis of the hypocotyls in the flight-grown plants.   Our hypothesis is that an endogenous response in plants causes the roots to skew and that this default growth response is largely masked by the normal 1-g conditions on Earth.\nIn the last year, we continued morphometric studies of the space-grown seedlings with light and electron microscopy.  We also focused on gene profiling studies by using microarray techniques.",

            "task_description": "Despite intensive countermeasures, muscle and bone loss remain among the top medical challenges to extended space missions. Whereas much is known regarding the musculoskeletal responses to microgravity, little is known about the physiological effects of prolonged exposure to partial gravity environments, and whether musculoskeletal deterioration may be mitigated by exposure to partial gravity. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed a novel ground-based model that allows chronic exposure to reduced quadrupedal weightbearing in mice. Using this model will determine whether partial weight bearing attenuates bone and muscle atrophy relative to full hindlimb unloading, and will test the ability of novel spaceflight-compatible therapeutics (e.g., sclerostin antibody and a BMPR1A antagonist) to inhibit skeletal deterioration across the hypogravity spectrum. In addition in a supplement to the original grant, we tested whether sclerostin antibody treatment would inhibit bone loss in microgravity on a 12 day shuttle mission (STS-135). Outcome assessments included in vivo bone density and body composition measurements, along with ex vivo measures of muscle weight, bone microarchitecture, and strength. Serum markers of bone turnover, and quantitatitve histomorphometry allowed us to delineate the mechanisms underlying the observed skeletal changes. In sum, our proposed studies use both a standardized microgravity analog along with a novel partial gravity model and spaceflight exposure to directly address a key element of the Bioastronautics Roadmap--Accelerated Bone Loss and Fracture Risk. Our ultimate objective is to mitigate the risk for space-induced bone loss and bone fracture associated with missions to low earth orbit, the moon, and eventually Mars. Successful completion of these studies will provide strong rationale for testing these pharmacologic countermeasures in human bed-rest studies and then leading to a trial in astronauts traveling to the International Space Station (ISS). Our findings will also provide insight into the prevention and treatment of skeletal fragility due to immobilization, stroke, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and spinal cord injury.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The current research has profound impact on Earth-based diseases and disorders resulting from insufficient skeletal loading, such as muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, stroke, and other neurodegenerative disorders.  Our goal is to characterize the amount of skeletal loading necessary to maintain bone and muscle mass, and to determine the efficacy of novel therapeutics in preventing bone and muscle loss.  If successful, this would provide novel insight for the rehabilitation of individuals exposed to musculoskeletal unloading or disuse.\nOur findings indicate that treatment with sclerostin antibody would be likely be effective in preventing disuse-induced bone loss in a variety of  clinical conditions, such as spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, immobilization and stroke."

            "task_progress": "In this project we determined the musculoskeletal effects of partial weight bearing in normal mice and assessed the ability of anti-sclerostin antibody (Scl-AbII) and soluble mBMRPR1A–mfc fusion protein to prevent disuse-related bone loss in mice. In addition, in a supplementary grant, we determined the ability of sclerostin antibody to prevent skeletal deterioration during spaceflight by conducting an experiment on the last shuttle mission, STS-135 in July 2011.\nFor our ground-based work, we studied female wild-type, adult mice (C57Bl/6J, 12 wks of age) subjected to partial weight bearing (20% of body weight, PWB20 and 40% of body weight, PWB40, Lunar and Mars loading analogs), 70% of body weight (PWB70) and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 21 days. Mice were injected with either sclerostin antibody (Scl-AbII) at 25 mg/kg or vehicle twice weekly. In vehicle treated animals we observed declines in bone and muscle that were largely dose-dependent for the partial weight bearing animals, including declines in bone and muscle even at 70% weight bearing.  Scl-AbII completely inhibited the trabecular and cortical bone deterioration due to disuse, with bone properties in HLU and partial weight bearing mice treated with Scl-AbII being at or above values of fully loaded, vehicle treated mice. Histomorphometry and serum bone turnover markers indicate that sclerostin antibody induces new bone formation. As expected, there was no effect of Scl-AbII on muscle loss. For some bone outcomes, the efficacy of Scl-AbII was greater in normally loaded animals than in those exposed to hindlimb unloading or partial weightbearing. Altogether, these results indicate: 1) partial weight bearing at loading levels up to 70% of body weight is insufficient to prevent bone and muscle loss; and 2) the potent anabolic activity of Scl-AbII, and its efficacy in abrogating disuse-induced bone deterioration.\nWe were not been able to complete our initial Aim 1 due to our inability to obtain huRANKL mice needed to test the antibody to RANKL. The reason for this is that Amgen was unable to provide the mice due to legal issues related to the intellectual property rights surrounding the development of these mice. Previous work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A-mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A-mFc leads to increased bone mass, improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption.  Thus, we proposed an alternate to test the ability of a novel anabolic therapy, inhibition of ALK3 receptor signaling via a soluble mBMRPR1A –mfc fusion protein, to inhibit skeletal deterioration with unloading. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A-mFc on disuse-induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension vs. cage controls (CON). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 wks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n=10 each): CON-VEH; CON-mBMPR1A-mFc; HLU-VEH; and HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A-mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2x/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU-VEH group (-5.3 ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc (-0.3 ± 0.9%, p<0.05 vs HLU-VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON-mBMPR1A-mFc than CON-VEH (10.2±0.6% vs 4.4±0.8%). In the femur, trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU-VEH compared to CON-VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A-mFc treatment led to improved Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups (p<0.05). HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc mice had 21% greater failure load (p<0.05) compared to their VEH-treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A-mFc led to significant increases in mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5-fold and 5-fold increase in bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A-mFc -treated CON and HLU animals vs. VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A-mFc -treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH-treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse-induced bone loss.\nFor our spaceflight experiment (Supplementary grant), we successfully completed a 13-day spaceflight with 30 mice on the shuttle STS-135 and 30 mice maintained as ground controls in the orbital environmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center. In addition,  tissues from this experiment were shared with over 60 investigators via NASA’s biospecimen sharing program. Major findings include: 1) significant bone and muscle loss in the mice exposed to microgravity, and 2) that a single dose of sclerostin antibody was able to prevent skeletal deterioration and induce new bone formation in microgravity. Further, we found that novel muscle measurements, electrical impedance myography, were sensitive to the muscle atrophy observed following spaceflight.  We also completed a companion ground-based hindlimb unloading (HLU) study, which showed similar results as the spaceflight study.  Altogether our results provide compelling rationale to test sclerostin antibody for its ability to prevent bone loss in human studies of disuse, such as bedrest.",

This issue is especially important given reports that the crew's immune system is dysfunctional during flight, and our recent discovery that spaceflight increased the disease-causing potential and globally altered the gene expression of the human food-borne pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Our research also showed that many of the observed changes in Salmonella were associated with specific proteins in the cells, called RNA binding proteins, that bind to and regulate genetic material within the cell to control cellular characteristics in response to stress. In addition, our studies during spaceflight and using ground-based, spaceflight analogue culture systems have shown that increasing the concentration of certain ionic salts, like phosphates, in the growth media can prevent the increased disease causing potential observed for Salmonella during spaceflight. Interestingly, human cells also contain evolutionarily conserved RNA binding proteins that are very similar in structure and function to those found in bacteria. In human cells, these RNA binding proteins are critical for the cells proper function, including supporting a healthy immune system, maintaining tissue differentiation, and responding to cellular stress. We hypothesize that RNA binding regulatory proteins and their small RNA binding counterparts are key to a conserved, common cellular spaceflight response mechanism in both bacterial and human cells and that this response can be manipulated by environmental salt/ion levels. The implications of a universally conserved molecular response to spaceflight would affect NASA's approach to infectious disease risk assessment, development of biological processing systems for exploration, and changes in biodegradation during a mission. Indeed, if these responses are also observed in human cells, they may translate into knowledge of both the astronaut's response to infection and possibly larger physiological responses that are influenced by cellular changes.",

            "task_progress": "I) We have identified common evolutionarily conserved spaceflight and spaceflight analogue-induced mechanisms that are conserved across different cell types and which alter their cellular characteristics and phenotypes. Specifically, we have shown that Hfq is an evolutionarily conserved central regulator of the microbial response to both spaceflight and spaceflight analogue culture in both Gram negative (Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus) pathogens.  Thus, Hfq represents the first spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue induced regulator acting across bacterial species.  In addition, we have also shown that these culture environments regulate the virulence and/or pathogenesis related phenotypes of these same organisms in novel ways that are not observed when they are cultured under conventional conditions.\nII) A NASA-funded flight experiment on STS-131, operationally called STL-IMMUNE, was awarded as a part of this ground-based flight analogue research. The objectives of this flight experiment were directly related to and complemented our ground-based work (including use of the same cell types), the goal of which is to identify universally conserved molecular responses to ground-based spaceflight analogue culture across a variety of bacterial and mammalian cell types.  Specifically, the focus of STL-IMMUNE was to 1) understand the effect of microgravity on the host-pathogen interaction and infection process from the perspective of the human cell, and 2) understand the effect of microgravity alone on human cellular responses that are relevant to normal cellular homeostasis or transition to disease. STL-IMMUNE was the first space biology experiment to conduct an in-flight infection of human cells.\nWe have now finalized sample analysis for global alterations in both transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, cellular differentiation, immune function (inflammatory response mediators), and stress responses associated with spaceflight in the presence and absence of infection.  All flight sample comparisons were made to identical synchronous ground controls housed in duplicate CCM hardware as that used for flight. Through iTRAQ analysis, we have identified 86 total unique human proteins (95% confidence, 1% FDR) that were expressed by the HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells cultured on orbit either before or after infection with Salmonella Typhimurium. These proteins belonged to a range of different functional classes and categories, including those important for metabolism, apoptosis, cell communication, immune function, and others. Of the 89 proteins identified, a unique subset of these were found to be differentially regulated in response to spaceflight, and showed differences in response to infection between flight and ground cultures. Collectively, we found intriguing differences in how microgravity uniquely impacted the spaceflight infected intestinal cells as compared to the ground controls.  We have also finalized global proteomic response profiling for the A549 lung epithelial cells as well.  Moreover, immunohistochemical profiling has revealed differences in both distribution and expression patterns of targeted host cell proteins and alterations in cellular cytoarchitecture. A manuscript reporting these findings will be submitted in early 2014.",

It is widely accepted that sedimentation of starch filled amyloplasts in the columella of the root cap and endodermis of the hypocotyl act to initiate the gravitropic signal. However, although pH and Ca2+-based signals have been proposed as key elements in this plant response, the precise mechanisms translating physical force to biochemically transmissible signal is still poorly defined. Needed is a high resolution spatiotemporal map of changes in ion activities induced by the gravity signal. Such mapping will be achieved by confocal imaging of plants expressing a range of GFP-based probes targeted to different subcellular locales within the Arabidopsis seedling. In parallel, we will use machine-vision technologies to quantify the distribution of curvature along the root and hypocotyl axes during gravitropism. Curvature and ion change distribution maps will be measured in wild type and mutants known to be defective in the pathways that lead to gravity signal transduction. By mapping the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of ion signaling to these morphometric analyses, we will be able to pinpoint where and when each component is altering tropic response.\nPotential for translation to future spaceflight opportunities: These studies will develop a morphometric technology highly applicable to spaceflight analysis where existing hardware can be used to collect the time-lapse imaging required for morphometric analysis. Such analysis will develop a quantitative description of the effects of the flight environment on plant development at levels of architecture ranging from branching patterns to the kinematics of growth. This will allow us to ask questions only addressable by the unique environment of Space; for example, defining the effects of mutations on gravitational response thresholds.",

We have used plants transformed with the GFP-based Ca2+ imaging probe cameleon YC3.6 to image the Ca2+ changes occurring in response to a range of abiotic stresses as well as gravistimulation (gravistimulation applied by rotation of the plant through 90 degrees). This sensor allowed us to resolve changes in Ca2+ levels in plants exhibiting gravitropic signaling/response with the major Ca2+ change occurring 10 minutes after gravistimulation. The timing of these changes was significant after the initiation of gravity response and we concluded most likely linked to the auxin-dependent machinery controlling growth responses, i.e. a late event in the gravitropic response following the initial events of perception. However, Ca2+ reporters with much higher sensitivities, the ‘YC-nanos’, have become available during this work and we have generated plants expressing a range of these sensors. Using these probes, we have been able to monitor Ca2+ changes that were previously undetected, most likely due to their much lower magnitude than required to alter YC3.6 signals. These Ca2+ changes occur in the lateral root cap and in the root cap columella (site of gravity perception) within 0.5-1 min of gravistimulation. This time-frame is within the presentation time of Arabidopsis, i.e. within the timing predicted for the generation of gravity signal transduction in the root cap.\nUnexpectedly, Ca2+ increases are also seen in mutants such as adg1 that lack starch and so are thought to not generate a directional signal to gravity in the root cap. However, the Ca2+ changes in these mutants are not linked to gravistimulation, occurring in a random pattern at the root tip in both vertically grown and gravistimulated plants. These results suggest that the starch filled amyloplasts in the root cap may be acting to localize gravitropic Ca2+-related signals in the sensory cells of the root tip and that without this strong directional component being maintained by the dense starch, the amyloplast membranes are free to interact with receptors at random. These random interactions would then generate the non-directional Ca2+ signals seen in the starchless mutants. This data supports the classic \"starch-statolith\" model where the mass of the starch in amyloplasts is required to reinforce the directional component of the gravity signaling system but is not required to trigger the perception machinery per se. Morphometric and kinematic analysis of the regional growth response of the root indicates all these Ca2+ changes occur well before gravitropic growth is detectable and they occur in regions of the root tip that do not show detectable cell elongation in response to gravistimulation. These data all suggest that these Ca2+ changes are likely part of the initial signaling events of gravitropic response.\n(B) Mutants in a range of Ca2+-related proteins alter gravitropic response.  In addition to analyzing a range of gravitropic response mutants such as adg1 we have also screened mutants in Ca2+-related proteins (e.g., Ca2+ transporters and Ca2+-binding proteins that are highly expressed in the root tip) for potential effects on gravitropic response. This has defined two Ca2+ transporters (ACA1 and CAX2) and the \"touch-related\" genes TCH1, TCH2, and TCH3 as showing reduced gravitropic response. Mutants in the Ca2+ transporters alter root tip Ca2+ signal dynamics, providing a likely link to their effects on growth. These transporters also play a role in anoxic response of the root, with the mutants showing resistance to anoxic challenge, providing a point of cross-talk between gravitropic signaling and root zone anoxia. A major limitation to root growth in spaceflight is thought to be root zone hypoxia/anoxia and so interactions between this signaling system and that of the gravitropic response have a potentially important influence on plant growth in microgravity.\nThe 'touch' genes (TCH1, 2, and 3) were identified from their transcriptional upregulation in response to mechanical stimulation but a role in gravitropic response has not been reported to date. We have determined that loss-of-function mutants in these genes show reduced gravitropic response but we have detected no clear alteration in Ca2+ signaling dynamics in these backgrounds. These observations suggest that these genes act downstream of the Ca2+ change, consistent with a role in interpreting the Ca2+ changes. All three of these TCH genes contain a Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. The touch-sensitivity of these genes also suggests a role in mechanical responses, suggesting they may act as a point of cross-talk between the mechanical and gravity sensing systems of the plant.\n(C) Hypergravity experiments support the need for sedimented amyloplasts in the gravity signaling system.   As part of our analysis of the initial gravity sensing machinery, we have been collaborating with Dr. Masatsugu Toyota and the lab of Miyo Morita (NAIST, Japan) in using a centrifuge microscope to define whether amyloplast directional movements are linked to graviresponse as well as characterizing the likely role of starch in this process. This new microscope allowed imaging of amyloplast movements while stems were experiencing up to 30xG. This analysis revealed that sedimentary movements of amyloplasts under hypergravity conditions are linearly correlated with gravitropic curvature in wild-type stems. It also showed that agravitropic mutants such as sgr2 and sgr9 have immobile amyloplasts at 1xG but their gravitropic response could be rescued by growing them at 10-30 x G. This rescuing of the mutant phenotype correlated with the G force required to force their amyloplasts to sediment. Similarly, starch deficient mutants have their graviresponse rescued by the increasing G-forces that caused sedimentation even of starchless plastids. These results lend further support to the “static” or “settled” statolith model where amyloplasts in the sensory cells must sediment to the lower face of the cell to elicit a gravitropic signal, consistent with the Ca2+ signaling responses to gravistimulation.",

This information can then be used to curtail harmful activities of microbial consortia thriving as biofilms on the International Space Station and for the long-term success of human space exploration. Bacterial biofilms were abundant on the MIR space station and were responsible for increasing corrosion and blocking a water purification system. Health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are also of great concern, including increased rates of infection due to the enhanced survival of organisms within biofilms and increased resilience of biofilm populations to antimicrobial compounds. Furthermore, experiments with Escherichia coli have indicated that biofilms formed under microgravity may have even higher levels of resistance to antimicrobials.\nWe propose to study how gravity alters biofilm formation with the goal of developing new strategies to reduce their impact on the operation of spacecrafts and the health of their crew. We will focus on two model microorganisms that form biofilms both inside and outside of the human body: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. These microbes can switch between benign and pathogenic interactions with humans and may be relevant to crew health during extended missions. We will examine how the three-dimensional structures of biofilms formed by these microbes and the requirements and regulation of cell-cell communication systems differ in microgravity compared to normal gravity. We will specifically focus on the role of cell-cell communication in mixed communities where ground-based studies have indicated that inter-species communication can lead to increased virulence. We will employ newly developed, non-leaching, nanotechnology-based, antimicrobial surfaces to aid in assessing differences between biofilm formation and structure in normal and microgravity and to assess their potential to reduce the impact of biolfims in future spacecraft designs.",

Furthermore, the low-shear conditions microbes experience in microgravity are similar to those found in the human body that are difficult to study.

The focus of this proposal is to build on these extensive insights to develop the next generation of biological assays and hardware concepts to address these hypotheses in ground and analog studies.

            "task_progress": "Overview and Objectives – a Synopsis\nDuring spaceflight, plants experience growth and developmental conditions that are distinctly unlike the terrestrial environment that has directed the evolution of gene expression patterns that ensure survival. Plants must therefore interpret novel stimuli, integrate new solutions and express potentially unusual suites of genes in an attempt to cope with spaceflight environments. Some of these responses might be directly interpretable as appropriate responses that clearly inform science of the stresses induced by spaceflight. Other responses might be confused or inappropriate due to the novel signals or biological processes present in the milieu of the spaceflight environment. Defining both kinds of responses is critical to understanding biological response and adaptation to all kinds of extraterrestrial environments, from vehicles in orbit to lunar habitats.\nOur objective is to answer fundamental questions regarding the metabolic and molecular response of plants to novel, spaceflight relevant, environments. In the current project we build on extensive insights gained from spaceflight and analog experiments to develop new biological tools and to guide hardware development to study the response to these environments with higher fidelity and wider scope. The biology will include new biosensors created to dissect the mechanisms by which molecular signals are conveyed and integrated into responses to spaceflight environments. Some biosensors will be linked to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) spectral variants to facilitate telemetric data collection, which will in turn enable robust robotic experiments with wide deployment options. The hardware to support this telemetric science, will be advanced in concept to include multiple spectral capacities in order to monitor multiple biosensor reporter genes simultaneously. The focus is on advancing telemetric imaging that will enable the potential future deployment of such biosensor-units in a wide range of potential spaceflight applications - ISS, crew vehicles, satellites and lunar or Mars packages - as the opportunities present. These experiments address the need to understand the biological response of eukaryotes to spaceflight, and other novel environments at the molecular and cellular level, with special focus on signaling pathways and gene expression.\nSummary\nFocus and Opportunities\nThe final year of the grant continued to help support people and efforts for additional characterizations of returned Flight materials from the PIs’ two Flight Experiments: APEX-TAGES and BRIC-16, as well as contributing to the support of ancillary analyses associated with the BRIC-17 returned material. Space Biology support enabled an additional level of analyses of these samples, and facilitated supplemental ground studies that continue to contribute to our understanding of the response of biology to spaceflight and novel environments. The data analyses led to the design and support of several analog studies initiated last year: 1) clinorotation and gravity vector disruption, including root skewing analyses in inclined planes, 2) hypergravity tests with a 2-3g centrifuge, and 3) a parabolic flight campaign opportunity and suborbital flight preparations in high performance aircraft (in support of two FO awards).\nThe concomitant ground and flight support represented by these grants enables us to combine the processes of flight biology preparation, flight data analysis, and hypothesis development and testing for unprecedented insight into biological responses to these novel environments.  The execution of this grant was (and continues to be) the ideal example of what NASA intended as the role of Space Biology Ground-Based Research: NRA-01-OBPR-06 “…to expand our understanding of fundamental biological processes and the mechanisms by which these processes sense, respond, adapt to, and evolve in the space environment…and in particular… the role of the genome and cellular structures in sensing and responding to gravitational force.”\nThe final year of the grant had several foci:\nUndifferentiated cells - cell sensing and signal transduction:   The results of the BRIC-16 experiment (see FSB 2012 report and related BRIC-16 report) revealed that undifferentiated cells can detect the spaceflight environment and altered gravity in the absence of differentiated tissue or organized developmental structures (Paul et al. 2012: BMC Plant Biology. 12:232\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/12/232\n, Zupanska et al. 2013: American Journal of Botany. 100:235-248). One of the most striking results was the engagement of “heat shock” and protein chaperone genes The results from the tissue culture experiments leads us to further dissect the sensory and signal mechanism(s) that cell cultures use to detect and respond to spaceflight. To further address these questions, we started a series of ground experiments to test signal transduction pathways in unit gravity, and to also stage out biological tools for future flight opportunities.  We initiated several new tissue culture lines, some of them containing GFP reporters, and others that are deficient in key chaperone genes.  Experiments with cultures carrying known mutations that are well characterized in the gravity sensation and signaling of intact plants will provide insight into the mechanisms behind those processes. If cell cultures are using these typical sensing and signaling elements, the mutations should greatly attenuate the cell culture responses\nReporter gene line development:   The results of the APEX-01 / TAGES and the BRIC 16 experiment revealed that a large number of genes were differentially expressed in response to the spaceflight environment (Paul et al. 2012: BMC Plant Biology. 12:232\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/12/232\n; Paul et al 2013: BMC Plant Biology. 13:112\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/13/112\n).  These results initiated the development of a variety of new GFP-reporter gene lines to support spaceflight applications.\nBiosensors in calcium-signaling mutant backgrounds:   A number of reporters were developed in calcium signaling mutant backgrounds; two lines show differential expression of the reporter gene in plants deficient in aspects of calcium signaling.\nQuality testing of flight hardware:   This grant helped to support the bio-compatibility testing of two types of spaceflight hardware under consideration, the Aluminum PDFUs for future BRIC experiments, and a new ceramic foam sponge for the ABRS plant biology growth chamber.\nParabolic flight campaigns (Zero-G):   This Space Biology grant contributed to the support of several parabolic flight campaigns that were awarded through the Flight Opportunities Office.  Since FO does not provide operations support, it is essential that the PIs have some other source of NASA funding to support the personnel and analyses. Our NASA NNX09AL96G grant was the foundation of this support, and crucial for our success.\nPerformance aircraft for Sub-orbital application:   The other un-supported Flight Opportunity Award received by the PIs is for a series of suborbital flights. This Space Biology grant also contributed to the support of preparations for the suborbital FO by conducting hardware and biology tests in high performance aircraft (T6 and F104).\nConcluding remarks:   We have accomplished an amazing amount of diverse, spaceflight-related science with this grant. Having this support has allowed us to develop a large range of biological and engineering tools to support four flight experiments, three parabolic flight campaigns, and enhance the technical readiness of our upcoming suborbital flight opportunity – all while conducting novel, fundamental ground-based research that expands the communities understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the spaceflight acclimation of plants. This research funding contributed to 16 publications over its lifetime, and to the support of three PhD students (Anne Visscher, Eric Schultz, Natasha Sng), three undergraduates (Lauren Frizzle, Justin Goodwyn, Zackary Guignardi), four postdoctoral associates (Agata Zupanska, Fiona Denison, Matthew Bamsey, Thomas Graham), and two biological scientists (Claire Amalfitano, Lawrence Rasmussen).",

Root zone hypoxia is thought develop in spaceflight as weightlessness leads to a reduction in the buoyancy-driven convection that usually aids in gas exchange around organisms. This in turn leads to the development of oxygen-limiting conditions with adverse effects on plant vigor and yields.\nOur analysis of Ca2+ signaling responses and associated gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis indicates Ca2+ signaling is linked to hypoxic response in plants. We have identified a suite of Ca2+-dependent proteins that show rapid transcriptional responses to anoxia in both roots and shoots. Mutants in two such genes, aca1-2, and cax2-2 (both Ca2+ transporters) are resistant to hypoxic challenge. These mutants also show disrupted gravitropic response suggesting that Ca2+ signaling may provide a point of cross-talk between the anoxic and gravity response systems.\nWe therefore compared growth and gene expression patterns in cax2-2, and wild-type plants grown on the ground and ion the International Space Station. Seedlings were grown on orbit and fixed in RNAlater for subsequent analysis. Differences in the of gene expression were analyzed post-flight by a combination of RNAseq and qPCR analyses. Comparison to ground-based controls maintained under normal and varying degrees of low oxygen conditions at 1xG, have been used to ask how much of the responses seen on orbit can be explained by development of low oxygen conditions around the plants due to microgravity conditions.\nResults from this analysis are not only helping advance our understanding of the development of anoxic response in space and on the Earth but also test whether the Ca2+ signaling system provides targets for genetically engineering potential countermeasures to this stress.",

The results from this work are not only providing insight into how low oxygen levels impact plant growth in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. The low oxygen sensing/response systems triggered by anoxic conditions in space are also those employed by plants challenged by low oxygen on Earth, such as during flooding of the soil or intense soil microbe respiration that locally depletes oxygen around the plant. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how Ca2+ signaling is involved in the low oxygen response induced during spaceflight is also revealing a role for this system in this general flooding/low oxygen response system. These results are providing novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant growth to varied soil oxygen status, such as promoting flooding tolerance in crop plants."

The sterile plates were then loaded into Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) and 5 PDFUs plus a HOBO data logger secured inside each of two of the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware. Germination was delayed by holding the BRIC at 4°C until the hardware was installed on the International Space Station (ISS).

After 8 days at room temperature, the crew injected RNAlater fixative into the PDFUs and the following day, the canisters were placed in the MELFI freezer onboard the ISS at -95°C. Samples were returned using the Dragon capsule in a -32°C Cold Bag, de-integrated, and transported frozen to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for further analysis. All flight procedures were completed successfully.\nPOSTFLIGHT ANALYSIS:\nSeedling growth was assessed from digital images of the thawed seedlings. A small but significant (P<0.05, t-test) redirection from shoot to root growth was observed in the spaceflight wild type plants versus the ground-based controls. This reallocation of growth was missing in the cax2-3 mutant suggesting this line may be resistant to some of the stresses of spaceflight that are responsible for remodeling growth in wild type.\nTRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING:\nAll samples were dissected into root and shoot and all yielded sufficient quantity 12-36 µg/plate and quality of RNA for both quantitative PCR and whole genome transcriptional analyses to monitor gene expression.\nIsolated RNA was sent to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotech Center who performed ribosomal RNA reduction, library construction, and RNAseq-based transcriptome profiling for whole genome gene expression analysis. The complete raw data-set from this RNAseq analysis was mapped to the TAIR version 10 of the Arabidopsis genome using the Tuxedo protocols. These transcriptional patterns were then analyzed for over-represented classes of genes.\nAnalysis of genes induced >5-fold indicated 38 genes were up-regulated in spaceflight in wild-type and in the cax2 mutant plants relative to ground controls, implying a core set of spaceflight-related genes. These genes cover a range of functions from hormone response genes to those related to oxidative stress. In addition, the induction of 210 other genes was suppressed in the cax2 mutants relative to wild type, suggesting these are targets of a CAX2-dependent machinery that is triggered by spaceflight, and so strong candidates for genes that are part of the spaceflight anoxic response that is triggered by the CAX2 protein. In addition, 329 genes were up-regulated in both cax2 mutants but not in wild type plants. As both of these CAX2 mutants are resistant to low oxygen stress on Earth, these up-regulated genes represent strong candidates for potential hypoxia resistance genes. Many of these genes are also elevated in the CAX2 mutant backgrounds in the ground controls but are further increased by the spaceflight environment. Analysis of this subset of genes using the GOrilla gene ontology analysis tool revealed significant enrichment in genes related to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and biotic stress responses.",

However, since the space environment is not optimal for plant growth, an understanding of how plants sense and respond to changes in their environment is of fundamental importance. The phosphoinositide (PI) pathway is highly conserved among eukaryotes and functions in the regulation of a multitude of cellular pathways. The lipid-derived second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) increases in response to many different stresses. We have shown that InsP3 levels increase with gravistimulation prior to visible bending in both monocot and dicot systems. We have generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the mammalian type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes InsP3 and terminates the signal. The transgenic plants have normal growth and morphology; however, they exhibit altered responses to many environmental stimuli including gravity, drought, and cold. While rapid changes in transcript levels occur in wild type Arabidopsis within 5 min of gravistimulation, the expression of several of the fastest responding genes does not change in the InsP 5-ptase roots in response to reorientation.\nOur hypothesis is that InsP3 is an important second messenger in the sensing and signaling of stimuli (including gravity). The plants with compromised InsP3 signaling therefore provide a valuable tool for dissecting the role of the InsP3 pathway in plant responses to the microgravity environment encountered on the International Space Station.\nOur primary aim is to identify the molecular changes that are specifically mediated by InsP3 in the space environment. We will compare transcript and protein profiles of wild type and transgenic plants that are grown in both microgravity and 1g in space as well as on the ground. The long term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms plants use to sense and respond to changes in their environment. This knowledge will help design plants which are better able to withstand space flight and microgravity conditions.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants provide a good model system for understanding several issues including plant responses to gravity, plant responses to environmental stress, and fundamental aspects of PI signaling. Our previous work has implicated InsP3 as a key player in gravity sensing and signaling and the transgenic plants have attenuated InsP3 signaling and reduced gravitropism.  In addition these plants have altered responses to different environmental stresses.  Therefore this study will help us understand plant signaling during environmental stress, which has long term implications with improving crops to better withstand unfavorable conditions. Furthermore, the phosphoinositide pathway is highly conserved among plants, yeast, and mammals. These studies using the transgenic plants with attenuated InsP3 signaling will provide valuable insights on the regulation and downstream effectors of this pathway and could also contribute to our understanding of the role of the PI pathway in regulating human physiology."

            "task_description": "Changes that occur to both the host immune system and pathogenesis of microbes during spaceflight represent a formidable challenge to the successful transition from short-to-long-duration spaceflight. This is a critical concern, since a) the immune system of the crew is dysfunctional during spaceflight, b) spaceflight uniquely increases the virulence and globally alters gene expression of the human pathogen Salmonella typhimurium when the bacteria are recovered post-flight and subsequently used to infect ground-based animal models, c) spaceflight-induced increases in S. typhimurium virulence are regulated by media ion composition, d) phosphate ion is sufficient to alter related pathogenesis responses in a ground-based spaceflight analogue model, and e) the evolutionarily conserved bacterial RNA chaperone protein, Hfq, serves as a master molecular regulator of many of these responses. While spaceflight has been shown to induce changes that can independently affect the host or the pathogen in a manner that is directly relevant to the development of infectious disease during spaceflight, none of these studies have been done when both the host and pathogen are simultaneously exposed to the spaceflight environment. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to challenge the human surrogate model Caenorhabditis elegans with S. typhimurium during spaceflight to study the role of the intestine in host-pathogen interactions in real-time, define virulence mechanisms, identify evolutionarily conserved responses, and test novel therapeutic strategies to prevent infectious disease. We hypothesize that the combination of a spaceflight-induced increase in virulence of the pathogen coupled with a blunted immune response of the host will result in a synergistic effect on the host-pathogen interaction such that the risk of infectious disease during spaceflight is exacerbated. We further propose that these responses represent evolutionarily conserved mechanisms at the level of both host and pathogen that are dependent on media ion composition, specifically the local concentration of phosphate.\nSee also:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/Micro-5.html\nNOTE (6/9/2017): Project continues as \"Investigation of Host-Pathogen Interactions, Conserved Cellular Responses, and Countermeasure Efficacy During Spaceflight using the Human Surrogate Model Caenorhabditis elegans--NNX17AJ53G,\" with the same Principal Investigator, Dr. Cheryl Nickerson.",

            "task_description": "The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e., primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g., mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on Earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA (NASA Research Announcement) because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research will provide a deeper understanding of how microgravity influences plant development. The focus of this research will be on the development of roots and how they modify the expression of their genes to adapt to the microgravity environment of spaceflight.\nThis research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of their cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature to overcome the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth."

Malfunction of the ABRS hardware on the ISS, de-manifestation from Space X-3, and delays in the launch of Space X-5 were set-backs we encountered during the first two years of the grant. However, we were able to overcome these early problems and completed most of the specific aims that we proposed. A major accomplishment of this proposal was the implementation of a simple method to delay germination of Arabidopsis seeds until experimental activation in space. We foresee that many in the plant space biology community will benefit from these methods. Another direct outcome of this grant is the discovery of novel plant proteins involved in modulating the cytoskeleton. These results have been published in high impact peer-reviewed publications.\nWe also successfully retrieved material from ground- and space-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. Processing and data analysis from these spaceflight experiments have been completed. We have deposited raw RNA-Seq data from our spaceflight work to the NASA GeneLab site but these have not yet been publicly released. During this funding period, we also completed glycomic studies of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in space and compared them with the corresponding ground controls. Both the transcriptomics (i.e., RNA-Seq) and glycomics results will be submitted this year for peer-review.\nTaken together, our RNA-Seq and glycomics results continue to point to the spaceflight environment as a major trigger for oxidative stress responses in plants. Our results suggest that the ideal plant ideotype for future space habitats could be similar to those that have been developed for marginal agricultural lands on Earth including crops tolerant to low oxygen (e.g., hypoxia) and other stressors (drought, insect resistance) as well as those with more robust cell wall mechanical properties. Such findings could be the bases of future spaceflight experiments wherein performance of plants with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress can be evaluated on hardware such as the advanced plant habitat (APH) or the Spectrum.",

            "task_description": "Plant perception and response to gravity is critical for appropriate growth, development, and environmental responses. Shoot gravitropism involves the perception of gravity by sedimentation of starch-containing amyloplasts in gravity-sensing cells, followed by transmission of the signal to additional cell types to promote directional growth. Vesicle trafficking to the vacuole is essential for the perception of the gravity signal, but the molecular basis for this requirement is unknown. Our long term goal is to determine the mechanism by which gravity is perceived by shoots and the gravity signal transduced to other cell types to produce a response. The objective of this application is to determine the function of vacuolar trafficking proteins in shoot gravitropism. We hypothesize that appropriate physical properties of the vacuole are essential for amyloplast sedimentation, and therefore for gravity perception. We will test this hypothesis by measuring the elasticity of wild type and mutant vacuoles using atomic force microscopy and by comparing the lipid constituents of the vacuolar membranes. We will also identify additional proteins involved in vacuolar trafficking by a combination of in vitro membrane fusion assays and in vivo immunoprecipitations and test their function in gravitropism using genetic approaches. This research will provide a molecular explanation for the observation that shoot gravitropism is specifically defective in vacuolar trafficking mutants and allow us to make testable predictions about the mechanistic basis for their agravitropic phenotype. It will also provide a foundation for the generation of transgenic plants with altered gravity response thresholds.",

The gravitational response interacts extensively with other developmental, hormonal, and environmental response pathways, leading to morphological and anatomical changes to the plant structure. Understanding of the molecular mechanism of gravitropism is therefore vital for the development of strategies to improve plant growth and yield under varying conditions. The development of technologies to analyze the physical properties of vacuoles and in particular the fusion between membranes is also likely to impact research in plant cell structure, stress responses, and growth and development under different conditions."

We showed previously that the TNO1 protein is required for efficient transport of proteins to the vacuole and initiated a characterization of the gravitropic defect of a tno1 mutant. Dark grown hypocotyls of tno1 knockout mutants bend slower than wildtype and TNO1 complemented lines when gravistimulated. In the past year we have made several significant discoveries related to this phenomenon:\n(a) Analysis of gravitropic bending kinetics in dark grown hypocotyls indicates that the knockouts show a significant lag in bending kinetics compared to WT and complemented lines.\n(b) TNO1 is also involved in root gravitropism. This was unexpected, as root and shoot gravitropism occur by largely distinct mechanisms and there is little overlap in the components required for each.\n(c) tno1 mutant roots also show a growth pattern that is skewed from the vertical, indicating a defect in plant growth or root morphology.\n(d) We hypothesized that these root and shoot gravitropic and growth defects could be due to either disruption of auxin fluxes or disorganization of microtubules. In support of this, the tno1 knockout mutants are hypersensitive to microtubule drugs, both in terms of root skewing, hypocotyl elongation, and cell morphology. Mutant roots were also significantly more sensitive to a synthetic auxin, 2,4D.\n(e) We are now in the process of visualizing auxin gradients and microtubule structure using fluorescent markers.\n(f) Electron microscopy of Golgi stacks in tno1 mutants has allowed quantification of defects in Golgi and trans-Golgi network structure between wild-type and mutant plants, providing insight into the cellular function of TNO1.\n2. VPS45.   VPS45 is a vacuolar trafficking protein that we have previously characterized. However, a knockout mutant in VPS45 is lethal, making the study of its role in gravitropism difficult. We recently identified a point mutation in the VPS45 gene via TILLING that causes a single amino acid change in the protein sequence. The mutant has a weak phenotype and has defects in both shoot and root gravitropism as well as general growth and morphological defects. We have complemented this mutant phenotype using a genomic fragment containing VPS45 under its own promoter, indicating that the mutant phenotypes seen are indeed due to the change in VPS45. Further analysis of the gravitropism defects is underway.\n3. SYP51/52.   A homozygous mutant in which expression of the t-SNARE SYP51 is reduced was identified. Initial gravitropism assays showed no significant shoot gravitropism defects, possibly due to functional redundancy or the residual SYP51 expression. Due to these difficulties, we are taking a different approach of using RNA interference to known down expression of SYP51 and SYP52 simultaneously. Constructs have been generated and introduced into Arabidopsis plants and transformants are in the process of being screened for reduced expression.\nVacuolar properties.   We hypothesize that changes in the physical properties of vacuoles contributes to shoot gravitropism defects in vacuolar trafficking mutants, either due to differences in protein content or in lipid composition. To test this hypothesis, we isolated vacuoles from wild-type Arabidopsis plants and from a vacuolar trafficking mutant (vti11) that has shoot gravitropic defects. Lipids were extracted from the vacuoles and sent to the Kansas State lipidomics facility for analysis. The data obtained were inconsistent, most likely because of the low concentrations of lipid in the samples. These experiments are in the process of being repeated with larger lipid quantities.",

            "task_description": "Our working hypothesis is that spaceflight factors (including radiation and microgravity) affect the growth and regenerative health of a broad range of mammalian tissues, including bone, muscle, and immune system, by causing indiscriminate slowing or arrest of normal cell proliferation. Specifically we hypothesize that there is a key regulatory cell-signaling pathway responsible for this space-induced arrest, namely the p53/p21 signaling pathway, and that either radiation and/or microgravity can activate it. We have already tested this hypothesis with spaceflight tissues from STS-131, validating some of its key aspects such as p21activation in osteoblasts, and are now utilizing mouse tissues from the recently completed Bion M1 30-day spaceflight to test the p53 hypothesis with long-term spaceflight tissue samples. Specifically we are working towards determining if the p53/p21 pathway is also altered during 30-day spaceflight in bone tissues by:\n1) By measuring gene expression and protein expression and modifications of key signaling molecules that control cell cycle arrest and proliferation such as those in the p53/p21 and PI3Kinase pathways\n2) Immunohistochemically identifying specific cell types in bone with active p53/p21\n3) Correlating p53/p21 pathway and related cell cycle status to bone loss measurements by histomorphometry, microCT and transmission R-ray microscopy.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The significance of the studies already completed and still underway is several-fold, but first and foremost they are a the test of an original and novel hypothesis that has the potential to be a common element of the already known tissue degenerative conditions observed in space, and an important predictor of yet unknown degenerative conditions that may emerge in long-term spaceflight, specially outside of LEO.   There is already incontrovertible ground evidence that  the p53 signaling pathway is key in the response to radiation, and there is also compelling evidence that p53 is required for tissue degenerative conditions caused by mechanical unloading.  Although spaceflight evidence is limited, skin and muscle in rats flown in space also show elevated p53, strongly compelling us to follow this line of inquiry.  The fact that p53 pathway is a powerful tumor suppressor, and inducer of cell cycle arrest (through p21)  and programmed cell death, or apoptosis (through p21), should serve as clear indicator if spaceflight factors activate the p53/p21 pathway, this may have systemic effects on all the body processes involving cell proliferation.  These processes are most notably the indispensable tissue regeneration that keep every organ from collapsing due to unrepaired cellular and tissue damage.  In addition these studies are also highly significant because they attempt to pinpoint the cellular specificity of the p53/p21 pathway activation in bone, and to determine if this is a organ-wide process or limited to certain cell types such as the bone marrow osteoprecursor somatic stem cell lineage.  If the p53/p21 pathway is proven to be significantly involved in spaceflight arrest of tissue regeneration and degenerative conditions, it will offer both a new pharmacological target for intervention by drugs such as pifithrin class inhibitors and as a biomarker of tissue damage in space.  Finally the Bion M1 studies we are conducting will shed new light on the old question of bone loss in space, possibly extending our understanding of bone dynamics in adult animals, and by being the longest experimental rodent exposure to spaceflight to date.  Already our recently published results on bone dynamics during STS-131 show that both osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes are involved in bone loss in response to spaceflight, and that both p21and p53 are altered.  When the ongoing Bion M1 tissue and cell studies are concluded we expect that we will have gained new factual understanding of bone loss in space under conditions previously not attempted, and will have an important new perspective about the potential for activation of the p53/p21 pathway to be a serious problem for human tissue regeneration during long-term spaceflight, and in human health and disease related to disuse."

The major accomplishment for the year was the successful recovery of flight and vivarium mouse tissues and live bone marrow stem cell cultures just concluded June 11.  The time leading towards spaceflight was also used in detailed preparation for the science flight activities in Moscow, as well as to analyze and publish previous results from the BSP shuttle flights.  Specifically during the grant year, final science procedures were prepared and tested in 3 experiment verification tests (EVTs) in which mice were dissected, as in the flight, samples prepared for microCT, histology, biochemical, and genomic analyses, and live bone marrow cultures differentiated in-vitro into mineralized bone nodules.  In addition to conducting EVTs, our preparations included logistical aspects of flight such as reagent procurement and placement in Russia as well as shipping of supplies and equipment to set up laboratory operations at the Institute for Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences  (for dissection and initiation of post-flight cell cultures) and at the Koltsov Developmental Biology Institute (KDBI) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  In addition to the science verification work described above we concluded the analysis of bone samples from the 15-day STS-131 spaceflight  and published a detailed and comprehensive accounting of the effects of spaceflight and microgravity on the p53/p21 cell cycle arrest pathway, as well as accompanying effects (Microgravity Induces Pelvic Bone Loss through Osteoclastic Activity, Osteocytic Osteolysis, and Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Inhibition by CDKN1a/p21.PLOS ONE, April 2013, Volume 8, Issue 4, e61372).  In brief we have now determined that short-term spaceflight (15 days) induces significant bone loss in the pelvic-femoral body-weight load-center of C57B6 mice, and that the multiple cellular and tissue mechanisms of bone loss are activated, including ostoclast activation, osteocytic osteolysis activation and osteoblastic cell cycle arrest mediator induction.  Specifically we found that the p53/p21 signaling pathway was altered by spaceflight with marked increases in the expression of CDKN1a/p21 in osteoblasts, and generalized suppression of p53.  These results validate the hypothesis that cell cycle arrest in osteoprogenitors is activated by spaceflight through p21, but also shows that cells are not induced to undergo p53 mediated programmed cell death/apoptosis, as indicated by decreased p53 levels and unaltered cell death.  Going forward we are currently preparing to conduct August 2013 Moscow ground controls in the spaceflight BLOC hardware, as well as repeating the \"bridge\" vivarium controls common to both flight and ground asynchronous controls.",

            "task_description": "The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs of the spine are important, weight-bearing tissues that are adapted to gravitational stress. The absence of gravitational axial loads on the body during exposure to microgravity may disrupt normal spine physiology and function. During microgravity exposure, deconditioning of the intervertebral discs and spinal tissues poses a serious risk upon re-exposure to 1-G and exercise. Our recent data in identical twins exposed to 30-days bed rest indicate that compressibility increases in the lumbar spine and its intervertebral discs during 30-days simulated microgravity. Because intervertebral discs become more collapsible during simulated microgravity, the probability of disc prolapse or herniation upon re-exposure to gravity increases.\nWe hypothesize that nucleus pulposus swelling pressures in mouse spines will significantly decrease following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. In addition, we hypothesize that lack of gravitational loading on lumbar discs during microgravity will lead to extracellular matrix damage and significantly reduced disc compression performance following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. To test our hypotheses, we will harvest and test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 15 and 30-days of actual microgravity on STS-131 and Bion-M1. Spines will be frozen and transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods of testing nucleus pulposus swelling pressure, lumbar disc dimensions, proteoglycan content, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 15- and 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures.\nSeparately, evidence suggests headward fluid shifts alone influence bone alteration. However, most conclusions are drawn from human bed rest studies and hindlimb unloading of rats aimed to simulate actual weightlessness. As a member of NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program, our lab acquired murine calvariae from a 15-day mission aboard Space Shuttle STS-131. In concordance with current theory, we hypothesized that compared to ground control mice, headward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity will induce adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight.",

            "task_progress": "1) Research Products: We have used state-of-the-art technologies to quantify morphology, biochemistry, and kinematics of spines (including the vertebrae, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, and spinal muscles) of mice after 15 and 30 days of actual microgravity.  Our research group is uniquely positioned to compare these data from animal models to that of changes that occur in crew members following 6-month ISS missions (NASA Awards NNX10AM18G and NNX13AM89G “Risk of Intervertebral Disc Damage after Prolonged Space Flight”).\n2) Type of Investigation:  Space Flight\n3) Relevance of the Research Products to NASA: We completed a well-documented and validated battery of histological, biochemical, and biomechanical measures, developed and validated to identify and quantify spinal features for mice during space flight.\nWe hypothesized that disuse and subsequent decrements in spinal muscle structure and function lead to alterations in biomechanical and biological pathomechanisms. First, microgravity leads to supraphysiologic disc swelling and increased disc height that may stiffen the lumbar motion segment and cause abnormal segmental movement patterns. These biomechanical changes may increase risk for disc degradation, vertebral endplate microfracture, and facet joint capsule strain. Second, swollen and unloaded discs in microgravity may have reduced nuclear matrix production and nutrient transport from endplate capillaries in adjacent vertebra. We propose that these factors may adversely affect disc cell metabolism, inducing disc matrix degradation (via decreased proteoglycan (PG) synthesis and increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinases).  Moreover, the impaired nutrient transport may adversely affect vertebral bone homeostasis.\n4) Map to Human Research Program Integrated Research plan: Our project directly addresses Critical Path Roadmap Risks and Questions regarding disc injury (IRP Gap-B4): Is damage to joint structure, intervertebral discs, or ligaments incurred during or following microgravity exposure? Our research will improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of spinal deconditioning induced by microgravity, and mechanisms of spinal adaptation following re-exposure to 1-G. Our long-term goal is to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures. The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize 15 and 30 days space-flight and recovery induced changes in spinal tissue morphology, biochemistry, and biomechanics of mice.\n5) Productivity of NASA-Funded Research: Our research team has two NASA grants to study spines and their adaptations to actual microgravity: one grant to test mice exposed to 15 and 30 days of actual space flight (STS-131 and Bion, respectively) and another grant to test 12 ISS crew members before and after 180 days of actual space flight.  In addition, our group was selected as part of a tissue sharing opportunity to initiate a new NASA project to study spines and calvaria from rats exposed to 90-days hind-limb suspension.  Thus, from a scientific standpoint, it is highly desirable to compare results from the present 15 and 30 days of actual microgravity to those changes that occur in ISS crew members following approximately 180 days of actual microgravity.  It is known that prolonged exposure to microgravity causes degeneration of the human spine, indicated by low back pain during space flight and increased incidence of post-space flight herniated nucleus pulposus. We examined the effect that microgravity poses on biomechanical properties of lumbar and caudal discs from mice on 15 day shuttle mission STS-131. Sixteen mice (space flight group, n=8; control group, n=8) were sacrificed immediately after space flight. For caudal discs, the space flight group exhibited a 32% (p=0.012) lower physiologic disc height and 70% (p=0.02) lower strain dependence compared to the control mice. Decreases in both disc height and strain dependence indicate disc degeneration and injurious effect of microgravity. By contrast, differences were not noted for lumbar discs. This potentially deleterious interaction between prolonged weightlessness and differential range of motion along the spine may underlie the increased cervical versus lumbar disc herniation rates observed among astronauts (Johnston et al., 2010).\nThe increased herniation risk is highest during the first post-space flight year, and gradually subsides thereafter (Johnston et al., 2010). Consequently, we also hypothesized that the biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc deteriorate during space flight but then recover after acclimation to normal gravity. To test this hypothesis, we compared the compressive creep properties of caudal discs after return from a 13-day Shuttle mission (STS-133) to those of ground-based control mice.  Six flight and ten control mice were sacrificed +1 day, +5 days, or +7 days after the landing of STS-133. Compared to controls, space flight mice had 12% lower disc height and 21% lower strain-dependence on swelling pressure. In addition, biomechanical properties did not recover significantly over the 7-day post-flight period. Overall, biomechanical properties of the caudal discs were diminished by space flight, consistent with observations that prolonged exposure to microgravity increases disc herniation risk. These properties did not recover after short-term (7-days) re-acclimation to 1-G loading. Our separate studies of skull bones documented significantly increased growth and elastic modulus of skull bones following 15-days of microgravity exposure (Zhang et al., 2013).\nSpace flight Decreases Bending Strength and Alters Failure Mode in Murine Spinal Segments.  Introduction: The effects of microgravity during space flight negatively impact the human spine and lead to increased risk for low back pain and injury. Intervertebral disc herniation risk is increased 4.3-fold following space flight [1]. Animal models are often used to study the effects of space flight on the spine, and compressive creep properties have been shown to decrease in mice post-space flight [2]. However, uniaxial compression alone does not cause disc herniation. Rather, hyper-flexion is a significant contributor to herniation, i.e. during heavy lifting in a flexed posture [3]. Due to the observed increase in herniation risk following space flight, we hypothesized that the bending strength of discs is decreased under microgravity conditions. The effects of space flight on spine bending properties have not previously been studied.\nThe specific aims of the current study were to determine: (1) mechanical bending properties; and (2) locations of bending failure in murine spinal segments following space flight. We hypothesized that biomechanical bending properties of post-flight mouse discs would be diminished and that specimens would fail within the annulus fibrosus or at the annular insertion to the vertebra.\nMaterials and Methods: The 14 animals used for this study were obtained through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Six mice were sent on a 30-day microgravity Bion M1 mission and acclimated to 1-G for 12 hours before they were sacrificed, while eight mice remained on the ground for the 30 days in standard vivarium cages. BSP personnel sacrificed mice and dissected and flash froze tissues. We received isolated frozen tails from the six post-space flight mice (flight, n=6) and eight ground vivarium controls (control, n=8).\nThe C3-C4 motion segment was isolated from each tail. The ventral side of each motion segment was marked with tissue dye to track orientation. Surrounding ligaments and soft tissues were removed to isolate the discs and vertebrae, and each specimen was radiographed to estimate disc height and cross-sectional area. Specimens were kept hydrated with phosphate buffered saline throughout tissue preparation. Each motion segment was placed in a custom 3D-printed four-point bending device such that the plane of bending coincided with the ventral-dorsal plane. This bending device had stainless steel rods inserted through the top and bottom pieces, perpendicular to the plane of bending, to create the four contact points. The lower supports of the bending system were spaced 7.5 mm apart, while the upper supports were spaced 2.5 mm apart and attached to the moving cross-head of a materials test system (ElectroForce 3200; Bose, Eden Prairie, MN). Specimens were preloaded between 0 and 5 mm at a rate of 0.05 mm/sec for 5 cycles, and then loaded to failure at 0.006 mm/sec. Ramping was terminated after failure, characterized by a drop in force of 1.5 N. From force-displacement data, the toe region was defined as the displacement corresponding to an applied force of 1 N, the stiffness was defined as the slope of the most linear region, and the strength was defined as the maximum load before failure. Paired t-tests were used to assess differences in failure strength, failure displacement, toe region length, and disc height between the control and flight groups.\nResults: Space flight reduced bending strength by 17% (6.27 ± 0.94 vs. 7.53 ± 1.13 N, p < 0.05) and reduced toe region by 32% (0.53 ± 0.13 vs. 0.77 ± 0.21 mm, p < 0.05) with no significant effect on bending stiffness (p > 0.25). Disc height was reduced by 16% in flight mice (0.25 ± 0.03 vs. 0.29 ± 0.04 mm, p = 0.054).\nThe two modes of failure identified by histology were: separation within the growth plate; and annulus avulsion at the disc-vertebra junction. Post-flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate while control spinal segments tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Polarized light microscopy showed annulus collagen fibers inserting into the cartilage endplate but not continuing through the endplate to the subchondral bone.\nDiscussion: The reduction in bending strength following space flight supports our hypothesis that reduced bending properties may be an important factor for explaining microgravity-associated increased herniation risk. The reduction in toe region is consistent with reports of decreased range of motion in astronauts, and the shortened disc height is consistent with prior studies investigating post-flight mice [2]. All specimens failed at soft-hard tissue interfaces between cartilage and bone, presumably due to stress concentrations caused by abrupt changes in material properties at these junctions. The increased likelihood of post-flight mice to fail at the growth plate before the disc-vertebra junction suggests a decrease in growth plate integrity, and may explain the reduction in bending strength without a corresponding reduction in stiffness.\nThe results of this study motivate future work investigating the underlying biochemical and structural mechanisms of growth plate failure in flight mice. Previous work suggests that chondrocyte polarity and TGF-ß family signaling are essential for growth plate health [4,5]. A thorough investigation of these traits in post-flight mice may illuminate effects of microgravity that compromise murine growth plate integrity.\nA limitation of animal models used in shuttle missions is the lack of clarity on whether post-flight changes are caused by the same mechanisms as in human astronauts. Microgravity likely has different effects on murine spines due to anatomical and physiological differences. The growth plate separations observed in this study are not relevant to adult humans, but may provide insight for mechanisms of vertebral growth plate fractures observed in children before growth plate closure. Interestingly, mice have been observed using their tails to move about inflight enclosures [2], which may be a confounding variable in accelerating disc degeneration. It should also be noted that the flight mice in this study acclimated to 1-G for 12 hours before they were sacrificed, and the effects on tissue properties during this period are unknown. Despite these limitations, this study provides the first analysis of bending properties of intervertebral discs following space flight and provides insight into possible mechanisms for increased herniation risk following space flight.\nSignificance: Intervertebral disc herniation risk is increased over 4-fold following space flight.

            "task_description": "Tail suspension or hindlimb unloading of rodents has been used as a ground-based model of microgravity because tail suspension, like actual microgravity, 1) induces a headward shift of fluids and 2) diminishes the contractile activity of hindlimb skeletal muscles that are normally involved in maintaining posture.  It is now evident that the shift of fluid toward the head and the unloading of postural muscles alter the mechanical forces exerted on arteries, the vessels responsible for regulating tissue blood flow and arterial blood pressure. For example, the smooth muscle cells in the small arteries of hindlimb skeletal muscle atrophies with tail suspension, and results in a diminished ability of these vessels to vasoconstrict. The compromised ability to constrict reduces the ability of the rats to maintain normal blood pressure, and consequently, these animals are susceptible to abnormal reductions in arterial pressure when the body position of the animal is moved from a horizontal position to a 70o head-up position. Conversely, cerebral arteries in the head hypertrophy, which can limit brain blood flow and result in loss of consciousness during head-up tilt. The purpose of this proposal is to determine whether the fluid shifts and reduced activity of postural muscles that are induced by microgravity similarly alter rodent arterial vessel structure and some key cellular signaling pathways. In other words, does space flight result in smooth muscle atrophy of peripheral arteries and hypertrophy of cerebral arteries? This work will provide potentially important information about the mechanisms underlying the reduced fitness and the inability to properly regulate blood pressure of astronauts returning to Earth.",

Further, analysis of cerebral arteries will provide potentially important information about the visual impairment of astronauts induced by microgravity This information will also support the development of treatments or countermeasures to improve crew health and performance following their return to a gravitational environment."

            "task_description": "This application aims to investigate how cells adapt to the unique aspects of the space environment, using the model eukaryotic organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Direct quantitative assessment of selective pressures on cell populations through generations has become possible due to the recent availability of the yeast deletion series. This powerful reagent is a mixture of molecularly engineered isogenic yeast strains that differ only in a single gene locus. Each gene has been replaced with an identifying \"bar code\" and the mixture contains a deletion strain for every gene in the yeast genome. The yeast deletion series is grown under a selective pressure, DNA extracted, and the barcodes amplified by PCR. The resulting product is annealed to a gene microarray chip comprising spots for the complementary sequence of each barcode. In this manner the selective growth of every strain in the yeast deletion series can be assayed in a single tube, enabling a genomic approach to phenotypic analyses.\nThese studies have a strong link and a clear path to flight research on the International Space Station because of the properties of the yeast deletion series: it can be flown in a quiescent state, and activated by simple fluid addition and completed by fixative addition. Importantly, the post-flight analysis is of DNA, which is orders of magnitude easier to fix and preserve than RNA. Given these characteristics, we propose a flight experiment, with a high probability of obtaining genome wide data. This flight experiment directly addresses two broad areas Fundamental Space Biology is attempting to expand:\n1) Life at molecular and cellular levels, &\n2) Life across generations\nTo mimic some of the elements of microgravity on the ground, in a proof-of-concept experiment we propose to utilize the rotating wall vessel, a form of suspension culture which mimics some elements associated with microgravity, namely random orientation to the gravitational vector, and falling at terminal velocity. Sets of the rotating wall vessel grown under conventional means will control for rotational effects, and spotting the yeast series on agar plates controls for the effects of suspension culture.\nOur hypothesis is that yeast cells will undergo a selective response to growth conditions that reflect the space environment and that this phenotypic response will be controlled by changes in gene expression of specific target genes. Based on our preliminary data our analysis will examine both specific pathways such as ones utilizing the Stress Responsive Element (STRE), as well as ones that test for novel pathways. The steps we will take to examine this hypothesis are as follows below:\n1. Identify those yeast genes regulating growth under the selective pressure of the rotating wall vessel, using the yeast deletions strains\n2. Confirm the ability of the specific regulatory motifs to directly activate transcription of a set of reporter genes\n3. Identify those trans-acting factors that interact with these regulatory motifs\n4. Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground based studies on the selective growth pressure in a true microgravity environment.",

            "task_progress": "Genes determining survival advantage in S. cerevisiae changes during static, RWV, and flight plate culture\n- Deletion series and scanning electron microscopy studies.\nOn the last space shuttle flight, known as STS-135, our labs flew the yeast deletion series grown in suspension culture.  Scanning electron micrographs show the phenotype of the yeast grown in true microgravity as compared to ground-based microgravity emulation. Analysis of the gene deletions that mediated growth advantage or disadvantage during rotation or flight allows construction of pathway diagrams to summarize the data.\nScanning electron microscopy (10,000X) demonstrated differences in shape, surface texture and budding pattern when grown in YPD in Opticells as suspension cultures.   Static ground controls had egg to barrel shaped cells, with single pole budding, and an undulated surface. Rotating wall vessel grown yeast were round to barrel shaped, with multiple, bi-polar budding, and greatly undulated surface. Space flown cultured yeast were round to egg shaped, with multiple budding > ground\nIdentification of genetic - environmental interactions in the flown and grown samples versus flown-not grown controls. In this analysis the normalized sizes of each of 4 replicates for each single mutant deletion strain was compared to the flown not-grown samples that were grown upon their return.\nPathway analysis. The 50 strains with the greatest space-related fitness defects were imported into the meta-analytical tool, GeneMANIA (\nhttp://www.genemania.org\n). GeneMANIA comprises a series of algorithms that searches large, publicly available biological datasets to find related genes. These include protein-protein, protein-DNA and genetic interactions, pathways, reactions, gene and protein expression data, protein domains and phenotypic screening profiles. These relationships can be of several types: Co-expression: Two genes are linked if their expression levels are similar across conditions in a gene expression study. Physical Interaction: Two gene products are linked if they were found to interact in a protein-protein interaction study. Genetic interaction: Two genes are functionally associated if the effects of perturbing one gene were found to be modified by perturbations to a second gene. Co-localization: Genes expressed in the same tissue, or proteins found in the same location. Two genes are linked if they are both expressed in the same tissue or if their gene products are both identified in the same cellular location. We then prepared a visual representation of the output from this analysis where each gene is a node in the network, and the links between each node represents one type of interaction between these 50 genes. This preliminary analysis reveals several clusters of functionally interconnected genes, including clusters of genes involved in DNA repair and metabolism, transcription, chromatin remodeling, mitochondrial function, polarity, ribosome assembly, and stress.\nIn conclusion: yeast deletion series are a powerful tool to study pathways mediating evolution fitness for life.  These studies have allowed us to define the genes which convey survival advantage and disadvantage during spaceflight, the pathways which the genes populate, and the control mechanisms which determine the changes.",

            "task_description": "This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. As in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments. Additional benefits of the project include training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "In addition to an improved understanding of basic biological questions, such as identification of the site of graviperception, curvature-induced (but not gravity-dependent) gene expression, the experiment also tests the effect of magnetic fields on plant roots. Therefore, biological questions are investigated in conjunction with physical principles. We intend to analyze the effect of static magnetic fields on biological systems. This work will provide a starting point for the current discussion of the detrimental effects of (electro)magnetic fields. In addition, understanding basic biological questions will improve the prospect for enhanced plant productivity, resource optimization, and reduced maintenance."

            "task_progress": "Report for activities since April 2015\nTime line: Space-X3 launched April 18, 2014; the payload returned May 18 and arrived at KSC 5/21/14. Post flight processing was accomplished between 5/22 and 5/25/14. Ground control experiments (performed Aug. 14, 2014) ran into additional delays because of a shortage of hardware (MFCs were badly corroded during flight experiment so that flight hardware could not be used for the ground control). The first ground control experiment resulted in lack of germination (likely the result of RNALater related NH3 contamination), and fixative leaked. Difficulties to obtain approval for a second clinorotated ground control delayed the second ground control experiment until Jan. 7, 2015. A no-cost extension ensured that most (but not all) analyses were completed. Subsequent work was substantially affected by the departure of the post-doctoral research associate who obtained a job offer in Korea that could not be refused or postponed.\nThe analyses of cytoskeletal arrangements was performed by confocal microcopy by June 2015; analyses are ongoing and almost complete. This effort is part of Andrea Edge’s PhD research.   Light microscopy started with sample embedding during de-integration; sectioning was performed in a six-month period (4/2015 – 9/2015, together with corresponding samples from ground controls). Analyses are partially complete and ongoing. Substantial results were obtained.  The experiment provided exciting insights in the gravitropic mechanism of roots, their adaptive responses, and gene regulation during flight and ground controls.\nResults:\nFlight experiment:\nA) Imaging.   The most important part of the flight experiment was the confirmation of the effect of high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) on root curvature. The data provide clear evidence that HGMF does induce root curvature as theory and ground experiments predicted. Because curvature occurred in weightlessness conditions, the gravisensing system of roots is not compromised by space flight. The enhancement of the amyloplast size in space-grown roots (see D, below) indicates metabolic adaptation to reduced effective gravity levels. The induction of curvature by HGMF in space-grown roots indicates that amyloplasts are indeed the organelles that elicit differential growth and therefore the originators of gravitropism.\nB) Cytoskeletal arrangements.   The comparison between static, clinorotated, and space grown roots did not show any substantial differences between the cytoskeletal organization of actin or microtubules. A high resolution analysis showed a greater variation in orientation and coherency of both microtubules and F-actin after clinorotation.\nC) Gene expression.   The examined genes were selected to metabolic relevance and connection to differential elongation. The chosen genes were (in order of average transcription levels with accession number in parentheses): Cytochrome c oxidase, amylase, Ubiquitin, Phosphofructokinase, Hexokinase, Alcohol dehydrogenase, Tubulin, Actin 7, P Pin-formed 1, 3, 7, Sucrose synthase, IAA transcription factor 5, Glucokinase, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Triacylglycerol lipase.\nComparisons of different conditions included flight conditions, clinorotation, and static ground conditions, with and without HGMF. Measurements were performed in the root tip, root proper, root shoot junction, and seed tissue. Gene transcription levels were assessed with validated primers using SYBR-Green based qPCR analysis.\nComparisons were based on regressions of the transcription levels of all examined genes and served as basis for the identification of up-or downregulated genes. The methodology resulted in a publication (Houston et al., 2015) and provides reliable assessment of gene regulation. Genes that responded to space condition, clinorotation, and HGMF included auxin transporter PIN1-7, enzymes involved in glycolysis (hexokinase, glucokinase), and sucrose synthase. However, not all tissues responded equally.\nD) Light microscopy.   The purpose of these studies was the identification of amyloplast positioning and size in the root cap. The difference between the size of amyloplasts from space-grown roots and those obtained from clinorotated or static roots was derived from systematic measurements of all detectable starch grains. The difference was highly significant and amounted to an approximate size increase of 30% in diameter. The amyloplast studies are important because they indicate that clinorotation (i.e., hyper-stimulation) reduces amyloplast size. Therefore clinorotation is likely to reduce gravisensitivity.\nIt is anticipated that a publication reporting on the results of the flight experiment will be submitted by summer 2016.",

NOTE 9/28/2012: Continuation of \"Novel Explorations Into the Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants\"--grant # NNX10AM86G, per PI move from Miami-Ohio to University of Mississippi.

This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.\nThese experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.\nA significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.",

            "task_progress": "Summary of Major Results\n***Project 1: Phototropic curvature***\nUtilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) on board the International Space Station (ISS), we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B.  Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1 g.  A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1 g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination.  Additionally, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be a product of directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravity.\n***Project 2: Gene Profiling***\nThe transcriptome of seedlings were analyzed from experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) to study the interacting effects of light and gravity on plant tropisms.  Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated and grown in cassettes in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for 4 days at 1g then exposed to a range of gravitational accelerations (microgravity, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53g, and 1g) and light treatments (blue light with or without a 1 hour pretreatment with red light).  At the end of the space experiments, the cassettes containing the seedlings were frozen in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) and returned to Earth on space shuttle STS-131.  The RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and used for the transcriptome analyses. A comparison of 1g-treated-spaceflight samples with ground controls identified 230 genes that were differentially regulated at least two-fold (p < 0.01). A further comparison of all spaceflight samples with ground controls identified approximately 280 genes that were differentially regulated at least two fold (p < 0.01).  Of these genes, several were involved in regulating cell polarity (i.e., auxin, calcium, lipid metabolism), cell wall development, oxygen status, and cell defense or stress. However, when the transcriptome of the all g-treated spaceflight samples were compared with microgravity samples, only approx.130 genes were identified as being differently regulated (p < 0.01). Of these, only 27 were at least 2 fold differently regulated between microgravity and 1g samples and included putatitive/pseudo/undefined genes (n=14), transposable elements (n=5), an expansin (ATEXP24; At1g21240), a cell-wall kinase (WAK3; At1g21240), a laccase-like flavonoid oxidase (TT10;At5g48100), among others.   Not surprisingly, there was a difference in the % of genes represented in individual gene categories when comparing spaceflight samples with ground controls and spaceflight microgravity versus spaceflight g-treated space samples.   These results emphasize the need for tissue fixation on the centrifuge for an accurate spaceflight control.  These results are one of the few reports of transcriptome analyses from a space experiment with plants that had gravity treatments using an on-board centrifuge.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by  \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

            "task_description": "Spaceflight, by impairing the differentiation program of stem cells residing within bone marrow results in bone loss, increased bone marrow adiposity, anemia, and impaired immune function.  Because these disturbances may potentially compromise the success of long-duration flights, there exists an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and implement effective countermeasures.  We propose to test the novel hypothesis that negative energy balance during spaceflight results in 1) bone marrow dysfunction and increased marrow adiposity and 2) altered signaling by  peripheral adipokines (cytokines produced by adipocytes) all of which, in turn, contribute to negative bone turnover balance and bone loss.  The proposed research will focus on the precise role of adipose tissue and the important adipokine leptin in mediating the detrimental effects of simulated spaceflight (hindlimb unloading (HU)) on bone marrow cells in mice by accomplishing the following 2 specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that increased bone marrow adiposity plays a causal role in mediating simulated spaceflight-induced changes in bone metabolism.  This will be accomplished by comparing the skeletal response to hindlimb unloading of wild type (WT) mice with mice incapable of generating bone marrow adipocytes (kit-receptor-deficient KitW/W-v mice).  Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, by targeting the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells, plays a key role in mediating energy sensitive changes in bone metabolism during simulated spaceflight.  This will be accomplished by examining whether transplantation of mesenchymal or hematopoietic stem cells from leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice into WT mice alters bone loss during simulated spaceflight. Completion of the proposed project is expected to increase our understanding of the role of energy metabolism in mediating bone loss during simulated spaceflight and suggest specific non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of spaceflight on bone marrow.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Osteoporosis is a major health concern.  To our knowledge, all forms of osteoporosis involve infiltration of fat into bone marrow.  If the increased marrow fat alters the magnitude of bone loss, as hypothesized, this research will have significance to human health that transcends protecting astronauts from bone loss during spaceflight.\nSuccessful completion of the proposed research involved substantial model development and validation and this work will have impact far beyond the specific aims of this project.  To accomplish Specific Aim 1, it was necessary to perform adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow cells into kitw/w-v mice (Specific Aim 1).  While bone marrow transplantation is routinely performed in the field of immunology, the impact of whole body sub-lethal and lethal radiation typically used to perform the procedure on the skeleton has received little attention.  In the course of validating our model we performed several pilot studies that led to the unexpected finding that high dose radiation with photons, while having devastating effects on the hematopoietic compartment actually induces bone lining cells to become osteoblasts, leading to a transient increase in bone formation.  Based on the likelihood that this activation of bone lining cells represents a potential therapeutic target we hope to pursue the mechanism for this response.  Additionally, we made major advances in optimizing adoptive transfer for bone research: we have developed a protocol where following lethal irradiation we have quantitatively replaced hematopoietic cells in bone marrow with donor cells with no bone loss.  This was accomplished with as few as 750 purified hematopoietic stem cells (publication in review and publication in preparation).\nMice exhibit premature age-related cancellous bone loss. Specifically, as much as 2/3 of the cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis is resorbed prior to establishment of peak total bone mass.  The negative implication of this bone loss for HU studies is obvious. The mechanism, however, was unknown. In the course of performing studies in which mice were housed at thermoneutral (32°C) to minimize adaptive thermogenesis, we noted that the mice housed at this warm temperature showed unusually high cancellous bone volume fraction.  Further investigation confirmed that premature cancellous bone loss in mice housed at room temperature is caused by mild cold stress (Iwaniec et al., 2016). While the low cancellous bone mass at clinically relevant sites in skeletally mature mice is an issue for preclinical studies, an even more important issue is whether physiological adaptation to mild cold stress influences the outcome of preclinical studies. This is of particular concern to spaceflight studies where mice housed at subthermoneutral temperatures during microgravity are likely to be more dependent upon adaptive thermogenesis than weight bearing controls, leading to bone loss independent of reduced weight bearing.\nReference: Iwaniec UT, Philbrick KA, Wong CP, Gordon JL, Kahler-Quesada AM, Olson DA,   Branscum AJ, Sargent JL, DeMambro VE, Rosen CJ, Turner RT.

            "task_progress": "Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that increased bone marrow adiposity plays a causal role in mediating simulated spaceflight-induced changes in bone metabolism.\nWe evaluated the impact of a 14d spaceflight (in slowly growing ovariectomized rats) and a 14d simulated spaceflight (hindlimb unloading (HU) in adult male mice) on bone marrow adiposity.  As described in detail in Keune et al., 2016, bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increased in the distal femur metaphysis during spaceflight.  During the same interval there was a reduction in cancellous bone volume fraction.  The observed bone loss was due to increased bone resorption; osteoblast number, osteoblast activity and osteoblast turnover were normal.  In agreement, HU resulted in bone loss in male mice and the bone loss was due to increased bone resorption.  However, we were surprised to find that HU did not result in an increase in MAT (publication under review) in WBB6F1/J mice.  It should be noted that this unexpected finding was replicated in HU C57BL6 mice (publication in preparation). We conclude from these results that increased MAT is not a prerequisite for bone loss in HU mice.\nWe originally hypothesized that mice incapable of producing MAT would be protected from HU-induced cancellous bone loss whereas mice with excessive MAT would exhibit increased bone loss.  We tested these hypotheses using kitw/w-v (MAT-deficient) mice and ob/ob (excessive MAT) mice.  As expected, decreased MAT was associated with increased bone formation and increased MAT was associated with decreased bone formation.  However, HU-induced cancellous bone loss was exaggerated in MAT- mice and not impacted by excessive MAT (publication in preparation).\nTaken together, our studies demonstrate that spaceflight-induced cancellous bone loss in ovariectomized rats and HU-induced cancellous bone loss in male mice each occur as a result of increased bone turnover, where the increase in resorption is inadequately compensated for by bone formation.  While lineage decision (mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts or adipocytes) was shown to influence bone formation and MAT levels, our findings do not support a causal relationship between MAT infiltration and bone loss during spaceflight.  Indeed, our studies in MAT-deficient mice suggest that MAT may have a protective role in limiting bone loss.  Further research will be required to verify these findings and determine the underlying mechanisms.\nSpecific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, by targeting the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells, plays a key role in mediating energy sensitive changes in bone metabolism during simulated spaceflight.\nWe performed a series of studies to test this hypothesis. Initial studies were focused on establishing the effects of leptin on MAT and bone turnover in normal rats and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (Turner et al., 2014; Turner et al., 2015; Philbrick KA et al., 2015; Lindenmaier et al., 2016). We also addressed the controversy as to whether the physiological actions of leptin on bone are mediated through peripheral or central nervous system (CNS)-mediated signaling (publication under review).  This question is important because leptin regulates energy metabolism through CNS signaling.  Subsequent studies focused on how leptin impacts bone and energy metabolism during HU (publication in preparation).\nTaken together, our studies provide strong evidence that leptin administered subcutaneously and hypothalamic leptin gene therapy have surprisingly similar effects on bone metabolism in ob/ob mice; specifically, leptin decreased MAT, increased osteoblast number and activity, and increased osteoclast activity.  Dose response studies revealed that the skeletal effects of leptin occur at very low circulating levels of the hormone (levels having minimal effects on food intake or body weight), suggesting that previously published reports demonstrating skeletal effects of leptin delivered into the hypothalamus were due to transport of leptin into peripheral circulation and not due to CNS mediated actions.  If confirmed, our finding that the actions of peripheral leptin on bone and central actions of leptin on energy metabolism are dissociable from one another would represent a paradigm shift.\nIt is well established that there is a close association between the magnitude of mechanical loading of the skeleton and bone mass, and that bone loss often accompanies weight loss induced by dieting (Iwaniec and Turner, 2016).  Potentially, this is due to combined decreases in peripheral and CNS leptin levels.  In support, we have shown that increasing hypothalamic levels in adult rats can reduce body weight but, in contrast to caloric restriction, promote weight loss without bone loss (Turner et al., 2015). It is well established that weight loss due to reduced food intake contributes to bone loss during HU and for this reason, weight bearing controls are normally pair-fed to HU rodents.  However, as shown for weight bearing rodents (Turner et al., 2015), leptin treatment of HU ob/ob mice, although inducing weight loss, did not result in further bone loss (publication in preparation).\nReferences\nKeune, JA, Philbrick KA, Branscum AJ, Iwaniec UT, Turner RT.

This variability is accounted for, at least to a large extent, by genetic variations between individuals. Unfortunately, the specific genes that modulate this genetic sensitivity of bone loss in microgravity are unknown.  To this end, we have recently completed a genetic study in which we identified specific regions on chromosomes (QTL or Quantitative Trait Loci) that either add to or reduce the propensity of an individual to lose bone when normal weightbearing is removed from the musculoskeleton. While providing critical information, these QTL still contain hundreds of genes, rather than a single one. Here, we propose first to greatly reduce the number of candidate genes with bioinformatics tools and then experimentally test the shortlist of candidate genes using knockout mice available from the Jackson Laboratory’s (JAX) Genetic Resource Repository and the JAX Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP) production center. The identification of single genes modulating bone loss during weightlessness can be used as a critical diagnostic tool for the identification of astronauts most in need of countermeasures as well as to unravel novel drug targets that preserve bone health in space.",

            "task_description": "Despite intensive countermeasures, muscle and bone loss remain among the top medical challenges to extended space missions. Whereas much is known regarding the musculoskeletal responses to microgravity, little is known about the physiological effects of prolonged exposure to partial gravity environments, and whether musculoskeletal deterioration may be mitigated by exposure to partial gravity. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed a novel ground-based model that allows chronic exposure to reduced quadrupedal weightbearing in mice. Using this model will determine whether partial weight bearing attenuates bone and muscle atrophy relative to full hindlimb unloading, and will test the ability of novel spaceflight-compatible therapeutics (e.g., sclerostin antibody and a BMPR1A antagonist) to inhibit skeletal deterioration across the hypogravity spectrum. In addition in a supplement to the original grant, we tested whether sclerostin antibody treatment would inhibit bone loss in microgravity on a 12 day shuttle mission (STS-135). Outcome assessments included in vivo bone density and body composition measurements, along with ex vivo measures of muscle weight, bone microarchitecture, and strength. Serum markers of bone turnover, and quantitatitve histomorphometry allowed us to delineate the mechanisms underlying the observed skeletal changes. In sum, our proposed studies use both a standardized microgravity analog along with a novel partial gravity model and spaceflight exposure to directly address a key element of the Bioastronautics Roadmap--Accelerated Bone Loss and Fracture Risk. Our ultimate objective is to mitigate the risk for space-induced bone loss and bone fracture associated with missions to low earth orbit, the moon, and eventually Mars. Successful completion of these studies will provide strong rationale for testing these pharmacologic countermeasures in human bed-rest studies and then leading to a trial in astronauts traveling to the International Space Station (ISS). Our findings will also provide insight into the prevention and treatment of skeletal fragility due to immobilization, stroke, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and spinal cord injury.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The current research has profound impact on Earth-based diseases and disorders resulting from insufficient skeletal loading, such as muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, stroke, and other neurodegenerative disorders.  Our goal is to characterize the amount of skeletal loading necessary to maintain bone and muscle mass, and to determine the efficacy of novel therapeutics in preventing bone and muscle loss.  If successful, this would provide novel insight for the rehabilitation of individuals exposed to musculoskeletal unloading or disuse.\nOur findings indicate that treatment with sclerostin antibody would be likely be effective in preventing disuse-induced bone loss in a variety of  clinical conditions, such as spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, immobilization and stroke."

            "task_progress": "In this project we determined the musculoskeletal effects of partial weight bearing in normal mice and assessed the ability of anti-sclerostin antibody (Scl-AbII) and soluble mBMRPR1A–mfc fusion protein to prevent disuse-related bone loss in mice. In addition, in a supplementary grant, we determined the ability of sclerostin antibody to prevent skeletal deterioration during spaceflight by conducting an experiment on the last shuttle mission, STS-135 in July 2011.\nFor our ground-based work, we studied female wild-type, adult mice (C57Bl/6J, 12 wks of age) subjected to partial weight bearing (20% of body weight, PWB20 and 40% of body weight, PWB40, Lunar and Mars loading analogs), 70% of body weight (PWB70) and hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 21 days. Mice were injected with either sclerostin antibody (Scl-AbII) at 25 mg/kg or vehicle twice weekly. In vehicle treated animals we observed declines in bone and muscle that were largely dose-dependent for the partial weight bearing animals, including declines in bone and muscle even at 70% weight bearing.  Scl-AbII completely inhibited the trabecular and cortical bone deterioration due to disuse, with bone properties in HLU and partial weight bearing mice treated with Scl-AbII being at or above values of fully loaded, vehicle treated mice. Histomorphometry and serum bone turnover markers indicate that sclerostin antibody induces new bone formation. As expected, there was no effect of Scl-AbII on muscle loss. For some bone outcomes, the efficacy of Scl-AbII was greater in normally loaded animals than in those exposed to hindlimb unloading or partial weightbearing. Altogether, these results indicate: 1) partial weight bearing at loading levels up to 70% of body weight is insufficient to prevent bone and muscle loss; and 2) the potent anabolic activity of Scl-AbII, and its efficacy in abrogating disuse-induced bone deterioration.\nWe were not been able to complete our initial Aim 1 due to our inability to obtain huRANKL mice needed to test the antibody to RANKL. The reason for this is that Amgen was unable to provide the mice due to legal issues related to the intellectual property rights surrounding the development of these mice. Previous work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A-mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A-mFc leads to increased bone mass, improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption.  Thus, we proposed an alternate to test the ability of a novel anabolic therapy, inhibition of ALK3 receptor signaling via a soluble mBMRPR1A –mfc fusion protein, to inhibit skeletal deterioration with unloading. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A-mFc on disuse-induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension vs. cage controls (CON). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 wks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n=10 each): CON-VEH; CON-mBMPR1A-mFc; HLU-VEH; and HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A-mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2x/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU-VEH group (-5.3 ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc (-0.3 ± 0.9%, p<0.05 vs HLU-VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON-mBMPR1A-mFc than CON-VEH (10.2±0.6% vs 4.4±0.8%). In the femur, trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU-VEH compared to CON-VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A-mFc treatment led to improved Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups (p<0.05). HLU-mBMPR1A-mFc mice had 21% greater failure load (p<0.05) compared to their VEH-treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A-mFc led to significant increases in mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5-fold and 5-fold increase in bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A-mFc -treated CON and HLU animals vs. VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A-mFc -treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH-treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse-induced bone loss.\nFor our spaceflight experiment (Supplementary grant), we successfully completed a 13-day spaceflight with 30 mice on the shuttle STS-135 and 30 mice maintained as ground controls in the orbital environmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center. In addition,  tissues from this experiment were shared with over 60 investigators via NASA’s biospecimen sharing program. Major findings include: 1) significant bone and muscle loss in the mice exposed to microgravity, and 2) that a single dose of sclerostin antibody was able to prevent skeletal deterioration and induce new bone formation in microgravity. Further, we found that novel muscle measurements, electrical impedance myography, were sensitive to the muscle atrophy observed following spaceflight.  We also completed a companion ground-based hindlimb unloading (HLU) study, which showed similar results as the spaceflight study.  Altogether our results provide compelling rationale to test sclerostin antibody for its ability to prevent bone loss in human studies of disuse, such as bedrest.",

Bacterial biofilms were abundant on the MIR space station and were responsible for increasing corrosion and blocking a water purification system.

A very fast response to stress is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), followed by intracellular oxidation. Space flight is associated with increased oxidative damage after return to 1 g, suggesting that microgravity and/or the transition between gravity fields triggers a response.\nWe propose to use a model organism used previously for space flight, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Studies in both hyper- and microgravity have already established many of the physiological alterations, and work from our own laboratory suggests that oxidative stress is implicated in the molecular response under both conditions. We will use hypergravity as a test environment for gravity alterations, and to dissect out molecular and cellular responses as well as long-term physiological outcomes.\nThe goal is to provide a complete picture of the oxidative stress pathway in hypergravity, and to determine and select the key molecular functions and physiological read-outs to be tested in microgravity.\nThe aims are to quantify gravity-dependent cellular ROS production and to determine the key points of entry into the oxidative pathway by using mutants that show a physiologically  altered response to hypergravity.  This approach will give a picture of the stress pathway, starting from fast cellular changes triggered by sudden changes in the gravity vector, to tissue-specific gene and enzyme activity alterations.\nUnderstanding the stress pathway in hypergravity opens the venue into looking at the opposite transition in the gravity load, from 1 g to microgravity during space flight, and will help predict the cellular and physiological response to other stresses imposed by the space environment.",

            "task_description": "Spaceflight immunosuppression is a significant obstacle to long-term human space travel.  Of foremost concern is whether astronauts/cosmonauts may be able to generate effective protective immune responses against infections while in spaceflight.  Using an innovative mouse experimental model, we propose a set of experiments that will test 1) whether initial specific activation of T cells is intact and 2) whether memory T cell function is maintained during spaceflight.  Memory T cells are the mediators of immune protection after vaccinations and whether they function properly during spaceflight will determine if pre-flight vaccinations may be useful interventions.  In our experimental system, transgenic T cells specific for a model protein will be transferred into recipient mice that have implanted mini-pumps.  The mini-pumps will release the model protein along with non-infectious purified bacterial cell wall components.  Specific T cells stimulated under these inflammatory conditions will be similar to those activated in a bacterial infection but no infectious agents will be involved.  Mini-pumps will delay T cell stimulation until after mice acclimate to spaceflight to ensure that initiation of T cell activation occurs in microgravity.  Naïve (previously unactivated) T cells will be transferred to determine whether responses to new immunological challenges (e.g., new infections) are intact.  Previously activated T cells that will develop into memory cells will be transferred to determine whether robust secondary responses may be elicited during spaceflight.  Our proposal directly addresses the research priorities of the Bion-M1 mission (changed to a Space Shuttle mission in 2010) to investigate resistance to infections and acquired immune responses without using infectious agents onboard the spacecraft.  Together, these proposed experiments will address some of the most pressing outstanding questions in spaceflight immunology and more clearly define the risks and potential countermeasures of spaceflight immunosuppression.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The alteration of the immune system in spaceflight has been suggested by some to have many analogies to changes in the immune system during aging. In these studies of the immune system in mice, we have found that the changes in the immune function in flown mice are much the same as in humans.  This suggests that there are common mechanisms of spaceflight immunosuppression in both mammals.  Discoveries made from this study will help us understand the immune system and the basic initial steps of activation as well as help find new targets to use in the treatment of immunosuppression observed in aging and disease."

            "task_progress": "Over 50% of the Apollo astronauts had bacterial or viral infections during flight or within 1 week of landing. Subsequent studies demonstrated that T-cells had a blunted activation response in vivo and in vitro after spaceflight. Studies from this lab have shown that early T-cell activation changes in microgravity.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of spaceflight on early T cell activation. C57BL/6J female mice were exposed to microgravity for 15 days on STS-131. Splenocytes were harvested within 2-3 hrs post-flight, cells isolated and activated (~9 hrs after  landing) with Concanavalin A and antiCD28 for 2.5 hrs. Cells were harvested (11.5 hrs post landing) and stored in RNAprotect (Qiagen) at -80°C. Total RNA was isolated from the activated samples with RNeasy (Qiagen).\nWe found that T-cell activation markers Interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2R alpha, interferon gamma (IFN gamma), TNF alpha, and IL-17 using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Expression of IL-2, IL-2R alpha, IFN gamma, CCL-3, TNF alpha, and IL-17 mRNA levels were significantly decreased 2-10 fold in the activated flight group as compared to ground controls. Expression of cyclophilin, and VEGF  was unchanged. Protein synthesis of IL-2, IL-2R alpha, IFN gamma, CCL-3, TNF alpha, and IL-17 was decreased in the flight cell supernatants when compared to ground controls. The observed downregulation of induction of T-cell activation genes combined with changes of synthesis of these proteins show that animal immune cells require gravity and that the spaceflight induced changes in T-cell function remains after landing. More importantly, these data correspond with previous findings of human immune function in astronauts after return to Earth and support the conclusion that there is a physiological dependence of the immune system on gravity. This suggests that at least one mammalian system developed on this planet is dependent on gravity for full function.\nImmune function in mice splenocytes was significantly depressed, similar to the immunosuppressive changes seen in spaceflown T cells. Additionally, gene array data from spaceflown animals showed a similar pattern of immunosuppression as compared to animals on  the ground with down regulation of several immune genes of interest. Expression of these genes was confirmed with qRTPCR. Activation was shown to be reduced in flown animals.\nFinally, the chemokines and cytokines associated with T cell activation were significantly increased with activation in ground animals and were suppressed in the flown animals. The lab is currently writing manuscripts on the data, so details of the data are not  available until publication.\nImpaired induction of T-cell activation genes as well as the altered synthesis of immune chemokines and cytokines show that gravity is required for optimal immune function in mice. The spaceflight induced changes in T cell function remained for many hours after landing,  suggesting that µg induced changes in the splenocytes require time to repair. These data suggest that at least one mammalian system developed on this planet is dependent on gravity for full function. More importantly, these data correspond well with our previous findings of inhibited human immune function in astronauts after return to Earth and support the conclusion that there is a physical dependence of the immune system on gravity. This project brings us one step closer to understanding the Earth’s gravity influence on the immune system.",

Changes in proliferation, differentiation, and genetic expression have been demonstrated in several types of cells (reviewed in Cogoli 1996, Cogoli and Greuter 1997). Among the mammalian cells, the cells of the immune system, in particular, are severely affected by the space environment. Especially T-lymphocytes are altered in their activation process. Change in growth rate, cytokine production, locomotion, gene expression, and PKC distribution have been observed on Space Shuttle flights (Tipton et al. 1996, Pellis et al. 1997, Cogoli-Greuter et al. 1997, Hatton et al. 1999, Lewis et al. 2001).\nAt the beginning of the space research, the experiments are based on simple question with answers like “yes/no”; at the present time the knowledge on the signal transduction mechanisms are progressing rapidly and the research is orienting to answer deeper questions about regulation pathways and to get a better understanding at the molecular level. Moreover, the laboratory techniques have evolved greatly. Sub-populations of T-cells can be isolated from peripheral blood, the expression of specific genes can be measured, and signal pathways can be specifically activated. This allows studying more complex and subtle reactions in cells biology.\nThe goal of this proposal is to study, thanks to these new methods, the finer regulation of lymphocyte activation, especially at the level of the cytokines IL-2, IL-1, and their receptors using different activation pathways.   The specific objectives are to further investigate, using several activators, the genetic expression of the co-stimulatory transduction pathway mediated by the CD28, to assess whether the IL-1 receptor is involved in the inhibition of the activation, to see if the activation is also restored in space as it is in simulated microgravity using anti-CD3/IL-2, and to determine which genes are then expressed under these special conditions.  Microgravity will be used as an inhibitor of activation without having to use chemicals putatively damaging the cells. The main hypothesis to be tested is whether the restoring of the activation under the specific anti-CD3/IL-2 activation is due to a restoring of the receptor (IL-2R and/or IL-1R) gene expression. Correlated aspects such as the expression of early oncogenes and the production cytokines and their receptor will also be studies. The experiment will be based on an on-going ground-based research using the RPM as the main tool.",

These targets will include those that enhance T cell function as well as targets to blunt immune function to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus and Rheumatoid arthritis."

Specifically, we will focus on the effects of hypoxia (i.e. oxygen deficiency) and pathogenesis on C. elegans exposed to hyper- or hypo-gravity situations. Previous studies using C. elegans have identified gravity-affected genes, measured muscle degradation, established spaceflight culture platforms, and developed a remote imaging system for worms. We propose to build on these previous studies supported by NASA and expand our fundamental understanding on the topic. Three objectives will be accomplished in the proposal: (i) Design microscale fluidic devices combined with real-time imaging to characterize worm behavior under stresses, (ii) Develop genetic and molecular techniques to study muscle degradation induced by hypoxia, and test whether/how this is affected by exposure to altered gravity, and (iii) Develop C. elegans pathogenesis models and identify key changes in host-pathogen relationships upon exposure to altered gravity. Collectively, the proposed research will help us understand the interplay between aging, environment, and infection on C. elegans, and lead to improved treatments and therapies to enhance resistance to bacterial pathogens during the stress conditions of spaceflight.",

We initially found that these worms can survive extremely high exposure to hyper-gravity (upto 500 G) in laboratory environments. Puzzled by this finding, we conducted rigorous tests by varying the duration of hyper-gravity exposure and the duration of recovery after the hyper-gravity exposure. A number of biological and biophysical parameters were characterized to verify whether the hyper-gravity stress produces any change in the worms. Such a detailed study was not available in the published literature. We found that some levels of significant changes in behavior were observed after 12 hours of hyper-gravity exposure but this effect was not seen at smaller or longer time durations. Infectivity of the wild-type worms were tested on three strains of bacteria and the worm survivability was assessed for over two weeks.       In summary, we developed a range of measurable parameters to assess the effects of hyper-gravity on free-moving worms. We found that worm motility remains virtually unaltered over a wide range of hyper-gravity exposure (1 G to 500 G) for time durations as long as 24 hours. Only under 12 hours of exposure, worm motility was decreased to a noticeable range. We developed a microfluidic chip technology with real-time imaging to process worm videos automatically and extract the motility-related parameters. We are also developing a scanner-based imaging technology to count worm survivability for infection assays that will circumvent the use of manual labor."

            "task_description": "Plants respond to gravity in numerous ways; the best understood is the change in growth orientation in response to reorientation of plants relative to the gravity vector. A growth asymmetry develops, which allows the plant organ to return to the original angle of growth relative to gravity. Understanding gravitropism is essential to facilitate growth of plants in the microgravity environment of space. Gravitropic bending is mediated, at least in part, by redistribution of the plant hormone auxin. This proposal examines the mechanisms by which the cellular asymmetry of auxin transport proteins is established and the molecular mechanisms that allow translocation of the auxin signals from the site of perception to the site of reaction.\nWe will employ three approaches to transiently alter the expression and localization of auxin transport proteins to examine the effect on gravitropic curvature in roots of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. First, we will use a temperature sensitive mutant, scd1-1, with a defect in endomembrane targeting to transiently disrupt auxin transport protein localization and gravitropic curvature.\nSecond, we will transiently perturb the activity and/or localization of auxin transport proteins through a pharmacological approach and measure the resulting effect on gravitropic kinetics. In our third approach, we will use well characterized null mutants with defects in auxin transport proteins and will express wild type copies of defective genes in an inducible expression system. This approach of reintroducing a gene function at a controlled time point during the gravitropic process, should allow us to understand when these proteins function in controlling auxin transport and gravitropism. The planned experiments will combine high resolution laser scanning confocal microscopy and high temporal resolution gravitropic analyses with transient perturbation of auxin transport to understand the dynamics of auxin transport protein localization and resulting auxin asymmetries that drive differential gravitropic growth.",

            "task_progress": "We have now completed an analysis of the gravitropic and auxin transport phenotypes of the temperature sensitive scd1-1 mutant, which has a defect in a gene encoding a protein predicted to function in Rab GTPase-dependent protein trafficking. All aspects of root growth and gravitropism are normal in this mutant at the permissive temperature of 18°C, while at the nonpermissive temperature of 25°C, scd1-1 exhibits significant reductions in gravitropic curvature, growth rate, and auxin transport. Basipetal or shootward IAA transport is reduced in the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild-type at 25°C, while similar transport amounts are detected at 18°C. These differences were observed using both traditional radioactive IAA transport assay and by applying auxin at the root tip and measurement of the shootward progression of fluorescent signal resulting from auxin induced gene expression, using the DR5:GFP reporter.  Just 8 hours of incubation at RT (25°C) after growth at 18°C is sufficient to show a significant reduction in IAA transport, nicely mirroring the timing of the defect in gravitropism.\nThe final line of experiments in scd1-1 focuses on examination of the effects of temperature changes on the distribution of auxin transport proteins in this mutant background.   We have used laser scanning confocal microscopy to examine the tissue level and sub-cellular distribution of auxin efflux carriers PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, AUX1, and ABCB19 that are translational fusions to GFP, with PIN2:GFP being best linked to gravity response. The pattern and intensity of fluorescence was similar in wild-type and scd1-1 at 18 degrees C.  At 25°C, the PIN1 and PIN2:GFP fusion in scd1-1 were found at substantially lower levels in the plasma membrane, and accumulated in endomembranes, while changes in the other reporters were subtle.  The membrane asymmetries of PIN1:GFP and PIN2:GFP reporters were generally maintained, although the membrane associated fluorescence signal was substantially weaker.  The apparent structure and character of endomembranes that accumulated PIN1-GFP and PIN2-GFP were quite different. This result suggests that in the mutant, these two auxin transport proteins may be trafficked by different pathways in the different cell types in which they are found, causing them to be shunted to different structures where they accumulate. The final step of these experiments has been the identification of the nature of the endomembranes that accumulate PIN2:GFP.  We have crossed endomembrane specific fluorescent markers for early and late endosomes, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and vacuole into scd1-1xPIN1 GFP and scd1-1xPIN2GFP.  Our studies indicate that PIN2:GFP accumulates in the late endosomes in scd1-1, consistent with a defect in a RAB-GEF that acts at this final stage of targeting.   We are currently completing the manuscript describing these results.\nA second line of experimentation utilized a pharmacological approach to transiently disrupt activity and/or targeting of auxin transport proteins to understand their role in gravitropic responses.  We have examined compounds which inhibit protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, specifically staurosporine and cantharidin, respectively, and combined these inhibitors with mutants in specific kinase and phosphatase genes, to provide evidence of reciprocal regulation of auxin transport by protein phosphorylation and regulation of gravitropic responses (Sukumar et al., 2009).  An undergraduate student completed a study of three endosidin compounds, ES10, ES11, and ES12, on gravity response and auxin transport. These endosidin chemicals were isolated in a chemical genomic screen by Glenn Hicks and Natasha Raikhel at UC Riverside for inhibition of hypocotyl gravitropism.  These experiments quantified the kinetics of inhibition of root gravitropism by these three compounds using high resolution imaging and identified doses of compounds that inhibited gravitropism, but not root elongation. ES11 and ES12, but not ES10, perturb the formation of asymmetric gradients of auxin induced gene expression across a gravity stimulated root. The effect of these compounds on auxin transport was quantified and only ES12 reduced shootward or basipetal IAA polar transport, which supplies auxin for root gravitropic curvature.  Therefore these three compounds fall into three distinct activity pathways, suggesting they act on different protein targets.  The effect of a fourth endosidin, ES2, on gravitropism and auxin transport was examined initially by Jonathan Watkins, and is now being examined in ES2 resistant mutants isolated from Natasha Raikhel’s lab, as the final step in publication of an ES2 focused manuscript.",

            "task_description": "This research has capitalized on a rapid turn-around spaceflight opportunity and the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFU) hardware to address how spaceflight affects gene expression related to low oxygen/hypoxic response in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root zone hypoxia is thought develop in spaceflight as weightlessness leads to a reduction in the buoyancy-driven convection that usually aids in gas exchange around organisms. This in turn leads to the development of oxygen-limiting conditions with adverse effects on plant vigor and yields.\nOur analysis of Ca2+ signaling responses and associated gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis indicates Ca2+ signaling is linked to hypoxic response in plants. We have identified a suite of Ca2+-dependent proteins that show rapid transcriptional responses to anoxia in both roots and shoots. Mutants in two such genes, aca1-2, and cax2-2 (both Ca2+ transporters) are resistant to hypoxic challenge. These mutants also show disrupted gravitropic response suggesting that Ca2+ signaling may provide a point of cross-talk between the anoxic and gravity response systems.\nWe therefore compared growth and gene expression patterns in cax2-2, and wild-type plants grown on the ground and ion the International Space Station. Seedlings were grown on orbit and fixed in RNAlater for subsequent analysis. Differences in the of gene expression were analyzed post-flight by a combination of RNAseq and qPCR analyses. Comparison to ground-based controls maintained under normal and varying degrees of low oxygen conditions at 1xG, have been used to ask how much of the responses seen on orbit can be explained by development of low oxygen conditions around the plants due to microgravity conditions.\nResults from this analysis are not only helping advance our understanding of the development of anoxic response in space and on the Earth but also test whether the Ca2+ signaling system provides targets for genetically engineering potential countermeasures to this stress.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is addressing how low oxygen sensing operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent signaling machinery of the plant root. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how low oxygen levels impact plant growth in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. The low oxygen sensing/response systems triggered by anoxic conditions in space are also those employed by plants challenged by low oxygen on Earth, such as during flooding of the soil or intense soil microbe respiration that locally depletes oxygen around the plant. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how Ca2+ signaling is involved in the low oxygen response induced during spaceflight is also revealing a role for this system in this general flooding/low oxygen response system. These results are providing novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant growth to varied soil oxygen status, such as promoting flooding tolerance in crop plants."

            "task_progress": "FLIGHT:\nThis project has completed the flight, sample recovery, and sample analysis phases.\nThe experimental setup for the BRIC-17 experiment was using surface sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis plated on nutrient agar medium in 60 mm Petri dishes (4 plates of wild-type and 3 each of two anoxia-related CAX2 Ca2+ transporter mutants). The sterile plates were then loaded into Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) and 5 PDFUs plus a HOBO data logger secured inside each of two of the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware. Germination was delayed by holding the BRIC at 4°C until the hardware was installed on the International Space Station (ISS). Germination was then started by warming the equipment to room temperature. After 8 days at room temperature, the crew injected RNAlater fixative into the PDFUs and the following day, the canisters were placed in the MELFI freezer onboard the ISS at -95°C. Samples were returned using the Dragon capsule in a -32°C Cold Bag, de-integrated, and transported frozen to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for further analysis. All flight procedures were completed successfully.\nPOSTFLIGHT ANALYSIS:\nSeedling growth was assessed from digital images of the thawed seedlings. A small but significant (P<0.05, t-test) redirection from shoot to root growth was observed in the spaceflight wild type plants versus the ground-based controls. This reallocation of growth was missing in the cax2-3 mutant suggesting this line may be resistant to some of the stresses of spaceflight that are responsible for remodeling growth in wild type.\nTRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING:\nAll samples were dissected into root and shoot and all yielded sufficient quantity 12-36 µg/plate and quality of RNA for both quantitative PCR and whole genome transcriptional analyses to monitor gene expression.\nIsolated RNA was sent to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotech Center who performed ribosomal RNA reduction, library construction, and RNAseq-based transcriptome profiling for whole genome gene expression analysis. The complete raw data-set from this RNAseq analysis was mapped to the TAIR version 10 of the Arabidopsis genome using the Tuxedo protocols. These transcriptional patterns were then analyzed for over-represented classes of genes.\nAnalysis of genes induced >5-fold indicated 38 genes were up-regulated in spaceflight in wild-type and in the cax2 mutant plants relative to ground controls, implying a core set of spaceflight-related genes. These genes cover a range of functions from hormone response genes to those related to oxidative stress. In addition, the induction of 210 other genes was suppressed in the cax2 mutants relative to wild type, suggesting these are targets of a CAX2-dependent machinery that is triggered by spaceflight, and so strong candidates for genes that are part of the spaceflight anoxic response that is triggered by the CAX2 protein. In addition, 329 genes were up-regulated in both cax2 mutants but not in wild type plants. As both of these CAX2 mutants are resistant to low oxygen stress on Earth, these up-regulated genes represent strong candidates for potential hypoxia resistance genes. Many of these genes are also elevated in the CAX2 mutant backgrounds in the ground controls but are further increased by the spaceflight environment. Analysis of this subset of genes using the GOrilla gene ontology analysis tool revealed significant enrichment in genes related to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and biotic stress responses.",

            "task_description": "A major challenge in mitigating infectious disease risks during spaceflight is to understand, model, and integrate the combined action of cellular, molecular, and biochemical networks in the host that potentiate transition to disease in response to infection by pathogens cultured in microgravity. This is a critical issue to address, as spaceflight negatively impacts crew immune function and alters microbial virulence, gene expression, and antimicrobial resistance, strongly suggesting an increased risk for in-flight infectious disease. Herein, we propose to apply our 3-D intestinal co-culture models as human surrogates to characterize their transcriptomic (via RNA-Seq), metabolomic (via mass spectrometry), and inflammatory responses to infection with spaceflight analogue and control-cultured Salmonella typhimurium. To facilitate a practical integration of these systems, the combined analysis proposed in this study will focus on the metabolomic subset associated with host oxidative stress, redox, and inflammatory responses. These factors are of key importance in the infection process and may contribute to reported abnormalities and dysfunction in the crews' immune system during flight. We will use systems modeling approaches based on both quantitative gene transcript and biochemical metabolite correlation and all of their known/inferable relationships between genes, proteins, pathways, and biochemistry that will allow us to form new bridges and a general framework for making these linkages between gene expression (RNA-Seq) and biochemical (metabolomic) data. This approach will allow for new insights into relationships between redox functions, oxidative stress, inflammation, and infection that either approach alone would not be able to achieve. By exploring interconnections between these systems over different kinetic timepoints before and after infection, this systematic approach will provide an unparalleled level of sensitivity and resolution of the dynamics of the host response to a microgravity-analogue cultured pathogen, which may lead to identification of novel infection mechanisms and strategies for prevention and control.",

            "task_description": "The long-term goal of this research is to identify and characterize mechanisms of plant vacuole biogenesis that are critical for gravity perception. A role of the vacuole in controlling gravity perception is well accepted, but the molecular mechanisms by which the vacuole interacts with amyloplasts or regulates their sedimentation during gravitropism are yet to be identified. We recently uncovered a novel vacuole phenotype in agravitropic mutant alleles of VTI11 in Arabidopsis. We predict that this vacuole phenotype of vti11 mutants has negative effects on the organization of actin cables or the cortical endoplasmic reticulum, and therefore prevents amyloplast sedimentation. In addition, we have uncovered a novel regulation of vacuolar membrane fusion by phosphoinositides. Based on our results, we developed the hypothesis that mechanisms of vacuole remodeling that are mediated by phosphoinositide signaling are critical for the perception or transduction of the gravitropic signal in plants. A unique assay for vacuole fusion that we developed will be used to determine the role of specific cellular components in membrane fusion and gravity perception. The specific aims of this research project are to: 1) Determine subcellular phenotypes that impair gravity perception in itt3/vti11. 2) Identify the role of phosphoinositides in gravitropism.  3) Determine the role of the Adaptor Protein (AP-3) complex on vacuole biogenesis and gravitropism.\nOverall, this research will improve our understanding of vacuole biogenesis, the interactions between the vacuole and other cellular components involved in gravity perception, and the role of phosphoinosidides in gravitropism.",

            "task_description": "Plants are exquisitely sensitive to mechanical stimulation which triggers changes ranging from widespread alteration in patterns of gene expression to profound shifts in development. Indeed, so pervasive is the mechanical stimulation from internal and external forces, such as the weight of tissues and organs, to a biology that has evolved under a constant 1xG, that the resultant signaling is thought to provide a required regulatory background to control a wide range of plant developmental and physiological processes. Despite this acknowledged role in plant morphogenesis, the overall contribution of such mechanical cues to plant function remains poorly defined, largely due to the difficulties in removing the pervasive 1xG-driven mechanical signal when conducting experiments on Earth. The microgravity environment of the International Space Station (ISS) therefore provides a unique tool to both directly address this hypothesis of mechanical load-driven morphogenesis, as well as to ask what features of plant growth in space reflect disruption of this mechano-signaling regulatory network. We have therefore grown seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana on board the ISS using the Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFU) hardware. We are comparing their patterns of growth and gene expression to ground-based controls to ask how the well-defined \"fingerprints\" of mechanical response are altered in space. In addition, we are characterizing plants grown in space whose mechanical signaling has been artificially activated or inhibited by mutations in a gene (TCH2) which has an established role in the mechanical signaling system of plants. Results from such analyses will address the fundamental question of the role of mechanical loading on plant growth and development on Earth as well as probing how manipulating this system through targeting specific mechanoresponse genes might be used to tailor plant growth to thrive in the unique environment of spaceflight.\nThis experiment has also been supplemented with a parallel GeneLab experiment to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. These variants (ecotypes) have been chosen to span the range of likely ecotypes to be used in future spaceflight experimentation and so will provide key baseline comparisons to help understand the impact of ecotypic makeup on responses to spaceflight.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research is addressing how mechanical sensing operates in plants using Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse Ear Cress). The work targets the Ca2+-dependent signaling machinery and a specific element of this machinery, a gene named touch-2, also known as calmodulin-like 24 (CML24). The patterns of growth and gene expression of wild type and mutants in CML24 grown on the International Space Station (ISS) are being compared to paired plants grown on Earth. On Earth, mechanical signaling systems are known to affect plant vigor, alter their growth habit (favoring plants that are smaller and more robust), and also impact on plant defense responses to pathogens. Therefore, this work aimed at analysis of how Ca2+ signaling is involved in the altered mechanical responses induced during spaceflight should also reveal the role for this system in the more general mechanically-linked responses of plants on Earth. Importantly, this research will allow analysis of the effects of the plant's own weight on its growth and development, research only possible in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. These results should provide molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant growth to varied mechanical environments, especially the relatively mechanically silent environments of spaceflight and controlled enclosed environments on Earth, such as greenhouses.\nThis experiment has also been supplemented with a parallel geneLAB experiment to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. The responses of these variants (ecotypes) to spaceflight will not only help further define how the altered environment of space can differentially affect even closely related varieties of plants, but also help provide important background data for the design of future spaceflight experimentation using different ecotypes of this widely adopted model plant."

            "task_progress": "This research has used the BRIC-PDFU hardware to address how the altered mechanical environment of spaceflight affects plant growth and gene expression. The research uses mutants in the core touch-response gene CALMODULIN-LIKE 24 (CML24) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and focuses on the Ca2+-dependent signaling network that operates in response to touch stimulation of plants. Both wild type and mutants in CML24 were grown on the International Space Station (ISS), chemically fixed, and then frozen on orbit and then their patterns of gene expression and growth habit compared to parallel ground controls once the samples were returned to Earth.\nThe overall experimental design was to grow seedlings of wild type, cml24-2, and cml24-4 on orbit using the BRIC-PDFU hardware, preserve the seedlings after 8 days using chemical fixation in RNAlater, and freezing in the MELFI. cml24-2 and cml24-4 are two different mutants in the CML24 gene that are thought to continuously activate or inactivate the gene respectively. Upon sample return, whole genome gene expression patterns were assessed using RNAseq to define whether the spaceflight samples showed a transcriptional \"fingerprint\" of altered mechanical responsiveness, or of other changes in signaling and response networks relative to parallel samples grown under identical conditions on the ground.\nThis experiment was also supplemented with a parallel GeneLab study to monitor the growth, development, and gene expression patterns of a series of natural variants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in space. Arabidopsis grows across the planet and subpopulations (ecotypes) show slightly different characteristics dependent on where they originate from. The ecotypes used in the experiment were chosen to span the range of likely ecotypes to be used in future spaceflight experimentation. This approach provides key baseline comparisons to help understand the impact of ecotypic makeup on responses to spaceflight and so provide important background data for the design of future spaceflight experimentation using this widely adopted model plant.\nPreflight testing (Science and Payload Verification Tests) was successfully completed in 2014 and the payload of 4 BRIC canisters containing a total of twenty 60 mm Petri dishes, each containing 64 seeds, was launched on board SpaceX-CRS4. All on orbit operations were successfully completed and the frozen samples were returned via SpaceX's Dragon capsule, transported to Kennedy Space Center, de-integrated and shipped to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where RNA was successfully extracted and RNAseq transcriptome analysis performed. Six to eight replicate samples were isolated per type of plant. All samples were in the “excellent” range for all mission success criteria.\nRNAseq was used to monitor the levels of all genes in each sample. To robustly define the up- and down-regulated genes, we used the Tuxedo RNAseq computer analysis pipeline and then applied three separate normalization methods that apply different approaches to statistically assign significantly differentially expressed genes: DESeq, EdgeR, and CuffDiff2. Agreement between multiple analysis approaches provides increased confidence that they are faithfully extracting genes showing true changes in activity in the spaceflight samples. Additionally, we used strict 95% statistical significance cutoffs and false discovery rates to maintain stringent selection criteria, and further maximized confidence by looking for where all 3 of the three normalization approaches agreed that a gene was differentially expressed. By these criteria 1556 genes were significantly altered in the cml24 mutant backgrounds with an enrichment in heat shock proteins, that may represent an enhancement of a core spaceflight response system. In addition to alterations in mechanically-responsive genes, flight transcriptomes were seen to parallel those of plants on Earth that have been challenged with the pathogen defense elicitor molecules. Thus, there is significant overlap between the spaceflight and defense elicitor gene sets with, e.g., 19% of the genes altered in flight being associated with bacterial defense response on Earth. As the flight samples were maintained under strict sterile conditions and showed no bacterial or fungal contamination, these results suggest alteration in defense signaling may be one element of the spaceflight response in plants. A further finding from this analysis is that up- and down-regulated flight genes seen in wild-type plants are often even more significantly altered in the cml24-4 mutant (the loss of function mutant in the CML24 gene) and this response can be reversed in the cml24-2 mutant that shows irreversible activation on the CML24 gene. Overall what emerges from these analyses is a significant enrichment in defense- and mechanically-responsive genes in the spaceflight environment.\nParallel analysis of the multiple ecotypes flown under the Genelab component of this experiment indicated genes encoding heat shock proteins are up-regulated in response to spaceflight. Heat shock proteins are molecular chaperones that act in many stress response pathways in addition to temperature stress. At a cellular level, these proteins act to refold or remove other proteins damaged by environmental conditions and have been highlighted in previous spaceflight responses of Arabidopsis cell cultures. Further analysis indicates other related molecular chaperones that change in some, but not all, of the ecotypes, further emphasizing the link between chaperones and response to spaceflight. Importantly, data logger information from BRIC-19 showed that no thermal excursions from the ISS ambient of ~24°C occurred during the experiment indicating these transcripts are not simply reporting a heat shock event but suggesting upregulation of a broad stress-related machinery in response to some other aspect of the spaceflight environment. Spaceflight also led to down-regulation of classes of genes and prominent amongst these were enzymes of the peroxidase family that are involved in remodeling the plant cell wall. A role for these enzymes in spaceflight was previously highlighted in results from the BRIC16 experiment, suggesting alteration in cell wall structure may be a commonly occurring plant response to the spaceflight environment.\nGene ontology/classification analyses of these data further suggest response to oxidative stress is a major component of the core spaceflight stress network, a conclusion supported by gene network analysis, such as with the QTLNetminer tool. The raw gene expression data for these analyses has been deposited as GeneLab Data System-37.\nIn collaboration with Dr. Richard Morris at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK, work has also been conducted on modeling how reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ interact to propagate stress responses in plants. Using a combination of in vivo imaging of Ca2+ and ROS dynamics and analysis of responses in the AtRBOHD mutant (defective in the Respiratory Burst Homolog D enzyme responsible for producing many signaling-related changes in ROS), the role of this enzyme in ROS-assisted Ca2+-dependent stress signaling has been dissected. This quantitative analysis allowed Richard Morris to develop a math-based model to describe this phenomenon. The model predicts a role for AtRBOHD-dependent extracellular ROS production in cell-to-cell movement of stress information within the plant. Using measurements of responses to inhibitors of AtRBOHD, mutants, and quantitative imaging, the predictions of the model have been tested and the model validated.",

            "task_description": "Changes that occur to both the host immune system and pathogenesis of microbes during spaceflight represent a formidable challenge to the successful transition from short-to-long-duration spaceflight. This is a critical concern, since a) the immune system of the crew is dysfunctional during spaceflight, b) spaceflight uniquely increases the virulence and globally alters gene expression of the human pathogen Salmonella typhimurium when the bacteria are recovered post-flight and subsequently used to infect ground-based animal models, c) spaceflight-induced increases in S. typhimurium virulence are regulated by media ion composition, d) phosphate ion is sufficient to alter related pathogenesis responses in a ground-based spaceflight analogue model, and e) the evolutionarily conserved bacterial RNA chaperone protein, Hfq, serves as a master molecular regulator of many of these responses. While spaceflight has been shown to induce changes that can independently affect the host or the pathogen in a manner that is directly relevant to the development of infectious disease during spaceflight, none of these studies have been done when both the host and pathogen are simultaneously exposed to the spaceflight environment. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to challenge the human surrogate model Caenorhabditis elegans with S. typhimurium during spaceflight to study the role of the intestine in host-pathogen interactions in real-time, define virulence mechanisms, identify evolutionarily conserved responses, and test novel therapeutic strategies to prevent infectious disease. We hypothesize that the combination of a spaceflight-induced increase in virulence of the pathogen coupled with a blunted immune response of the host will result in a synergistic effect on the host-pathogen interaction such that the risk of infectious disease during spaceflight is exacerbated. We further propose that these responses represent evolutionarily conserved mechanisms at the level of both host and pathogen that are dependent on media ion composition, specifically the local concentration of phosphate.\nSee also:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/Micro-5.html\nNOTE (6/9/2017): Project continues as \"Investigation of Host-Pathogen Interactions, Conserved Cellular Responses, and Countermeasure Efficacy During Spaceflight using the Human Surrogate Model Caenorhabditis elegans--NNX17AJ53G,\" with the same Principal Investigator, Dr. Cheryl Nickerson.",

            "task_description": "The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e., primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g., mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on Earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA (NASA Research Announcement) because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "This research will provide a deeper understanding of how microgravity influences plant development. The focus of this research will be on the development of roots and how they modify the expression of their genes to adapt to the microgravity environment of spaceflight.\nThis research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of their cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature to overcome the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth."

Malfunction of the ABRS hardware on the ISS, de-manifestation from Space X-3, and delays in the launch of Space X-5 were set-backs we encountered during the first two years of the grant. However, we were able to overcome these early problems and completed most of the specific aims that we proposed. A major accomplishment of this proposal was the implementation of a simple method to delay germination of Arabidopsis seeds until experimental activation in space. We foresee that many in the plant space biology community will benefit from these methods. Another direct outcome of this grant is the discovery of novel plant proteins involved in modulating the cytoskeleton. These results have been published in high impact peer-reviewed publications.\nWe also successfully retrieved material from ground- and space-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. Processing and data analysis from these spaceflight experiments have been completed. We have deposited raw RNA-Seq data from our spaceflight work to the NASA GeneLab site but these have not yet been publicly released. During this funding period, we also completed glycomic studies of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in space and compared them with the corresponding ground controls. Both the transcriptomics (i.e., RNA-Seq) and glycomics results will be submitted this year for peer-review.\nTaken together, our RNA-Seq and glycomics results continue to point to the spaceflight environment as a major trigger for oxidative stress responses in plants. Our results suggest that the ideal plant ideotype for future space habitats could be similar to those that have been developed for marginal agricultural lands on Earth including crops tolerant to low oxygen (e.g., hypoxia) and other stressors (drought, insect resistance) as well as those with more robust cell wall mechanical properties. Such findings could be the bases of future spaceflight experiments wherein performance of plants with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress can be evaluated on hardware such as the advanced plant habitat (APH) or the Spectrum.",

            "task_description": "Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.\nPlants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development, and reduces yield.\nIn animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).\nIn all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast (8-10) and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.\nWe believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.\nWe also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.\nWe also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.\nIn conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.\nREFERENCES\n1.

These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to a variety of plant cellular stress responses. We successfully completed both of the preflight tests (science verification test (SVT) and experiment verification test (EVT)) to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the plant samples returned from BRIC-22. On August 14, 2017 our experiment was launched on board the SpaceX-12 ISS resupply mission and was successfully executed by ISS astronauts. The samples were preserved on orbit and underwent atmospheric reentry on board the same Dragon capsule in September of 2017. At the same time a duplicate of the experiment was grown at the Kennedy Space Center using temperature conditions which were matched to the flight conditions. We extracted RNA from both sets of samples and performed RNA sequencing in order to better understand what genes would be turned on and off specifically by spaceflight conditions in wild type plants and our mutant plants. We observed changes in the way that thousands of genes were activated in response to these conditions between flight and ground conditions and are submitting our results for peer review.\nMeanwhile, further research on these stress regulating genes and the Arabidopsis mutants that were tested in BRIC-22 is also being completed in continuing ground-based studies. Through a better understanding of these gene’s function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses.",

            "task_description": "The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs of the spine are important, weight-bearing tissues that are adapted to gravitational stress. The absence of gravitational axial loads on the body during exposure to microgravity may disrupt normal spine physiology and function. During microgravity exposure, deconditioning of the intervertebral discs and spinal tissues poses a serious risk upon re-exposure to 1-G and exercise. Our recent data in identical twins exposed to 30-days bed rest indicate that compressibility increases in the lumbar spine and its intervertebral discs during 30-days simulated microgravity. Because intervertebral discs become more collapsible during simulated microgravity, the probability of disc prolapse or herniation upon re-exposure to gravity increases.\nWe hypothesize that nucleus pulposus swelling pressures in mouse spines will significantly decrease following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. In addition, we hypothesize that lack of gravitational loading on lumbar discs during microgravity will lead to extracellular matrix damage and significantly reduced disc compression performance following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. To test our hypotheses, we will harvest and test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 15 and 30-days of actual microgravity on STS-131 and Bion-M1. Spines will be frozen and transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods of testing nucleus pulposus swelling pressure, lumbar disc dimensions, proteoglycan content, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 15- and 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures.\nSeparately, evidence suggests headward fluid shifts alone influence bone alteration. However, most conclusions are drawn from human bed rest studies and hindlimb unloading of rats aimed to simulate actual weightlessness. As a member of NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program, our lab acquired murine calvariae from a 15-day mission aboard Space Shuttle STS-131. In concordance with current theory, we hypothesized that compared to ground control mice, headward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity will induce adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight.",

            "task_progress": "1) Research Products: We have used state-of-the-art technologies to quantify morphology, biochemistry, and kinematics of spines (including the vertebrae, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, and spinal muscles) of mice after 15 and 30 days of actual microgravity.  Our research group is uniquely positioned to compare these data from animal models to that of changes that occur in crew members following 6-month ISS missions (NASA Awards NNX10AM18G and NNX13AM89G “Risk of Intervertebral Disc Damage after Prolonged Space Flight”).\n2) Type of Investigation:  Space Flight\n3) Relevance of the Research Products to NASA: We completed a well-documented and validated battery of histological, biochemical, and biomechanical measures, developed and validated to identify and quantify spinal features for mice during space flight.\nWe hypothesized that disuse and subsequent decrements in spinal muscle structure and function lead to alterations in biomechanical and biological pathomechanisms. First, microgravity leads to supraphysiologic disc swelling and increased disc height that may stiffen the lumbar motion segment and cause abnormal segmental movement patterns. These biomechanical changes may increase risk for disc degradation, vertebral endplate microfracture, and facet joint capsule strain. Second, swollen and unloaded discs in microgravity may have reduced nuclear matrix production and nutrient transport from endplate capillaries in adjacent vertebra. We propose that these factors may adversely affect disc cell metabolism, inducing disc matrix degradation (via decreased proteoglycan (PG) synthesis and increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinases).  Moreover, the impaired nutrient transport may adversely affect vertebral bone homeostasis.\n4) Map to Human Research Program Integrated Research plan: Our project directly addresses Critical Path Roadmap Risks and Questions regarding disc injury (IRP Gap-B4): Is damage to joint structure, intervertebral discs, or ligaments incurred during or following microgravity exposure? Our research will improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of spinal deconditioning induced by microgravity, and mechanisms of spinal adaptation following re-exposure to 1-G. Our long-term goal is to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures. The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize 15 and 30 days space-flight and recovery induced changes in spinal tissue morphology, biochemistry, and biomechanics of mice.\n5) Productivity of NASA-Funded Research: Our research team has two NASA grants to study spines and their adaptations to actual microgravity: one grant to test mice exposed to 15 and 30 days of actual space flight (STS-131 and Bion, respectively) and another grant to test 12 ISS crew members before and after 180 days of actual space flight.  In addition, our group was selected as part of a tissue sharing opportunity to initiate a new NASA project to study spines and calvaria from rats exposed to 90-days hind-limb suspension.  Thus, from a scientific standpoint, it is highly desirable to compare results from the present 15 and 30 days of actual microgravity to those changes that occur in ISS crew members following approximately 180 days of actual microgravity.  It is known that prolonged exposure to microgravity causes degeneration of the human spine, indicated by low back pain during space flight and increased incidence of post-space flight herniated nucleus pulposus. We examined the effect that microgravity poses on biomechanical properties of lumbar and caudal discs from mice on 15 day shuttle mission STS-131. Sixteen mice (space flight group, n=8; control group, n=8) were sacrificed immediately after space flight. For caudal discs, the space flight group exhibited a 32% (p=0.012) lower physiologic disc height and 70% (p=0.02) lower strain dependence compared to the control mice. Decreases in both disc height and strain dependence indicate disc degeneration and injurious effect of microgravity. By contrast, differences were not noted for lumbar discs. This potentially deleterious interaction between prolonged weightlessness and differential range of motion along the spine may underlie the increased cervical versus lumbar disc herniation rates observed among astronauts (Johnston et al., 2010).\nThe increased herniation risk is highest during the first post-space flight year, and gradually subsides thereafter (Johnston et al., 2010). Consequently, we also hypothesized that the biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc deteriorate during space flight but then recover after acclimation to normal gravity. To test this hypothesis, we compared the compressive creep properties of caudal discs after return from a 13-day Shuttle mission (STS-133) to those of ground-based control mice.  Six flight and ten control mice were sacrificed +1 day, +5 days, or +7 days after the landing of STS-133. Compared to controls, space flight mice had 12% lower disc height and 21% lower strain-dependence on swelling pressure. In addition, biomechanical properties did not recover significantly over the 7-day post-flight period. Overall, biomechanical properties of the caudal discs were diminished by space flight, consistent with observations that prolonged exposure to microgravity increases disc herniation risk. These properties did not recover after short-term (7-days) re-acclimation to 1-G loading. Our separate studies of skull bones documented significantly increased growth and elastic modulus of skull bones following 15-days of microgravity exposure (Zhang et al., 2013).\nSpace flight Decreases Bending Strength and Alters Failure Mode in Murine Spinal Segments.  Introduction: The effects of microgravity during space flight negatively impact the human spine and lead to increased risk for low back pain and injury. Intervertebral disc herniation risk is increased 4.3-fold following space flight [1]. Animal models are often used to study the effects of space flight on the spine, and compressive creep properties have been shown to decrease in mice post-space flight [2]. However, uniaxial compression alone does not cause disc herniation. Rather, hyper-flexion is a significant contributor to herniation, i.e. during heavy lifting in a flexed posture [3]. Due to the observed increase in herniation risk following space flight, we hypothesized that the bending strength of discs is decreased under microgravity conditions. The effects of space flight on spine bending properties have not previously been studied.\nThe specific aims of the current study were to determine: (1) mechanical bending properties; and (2) locations of bending failure in murine spinal segments following space flight. We hypothesized that biomechanical bending properties of post-flight mouse discs would be diminished and that specimens would fail within the annulus fibrosus or at the annular insertion to the vertebra.\nMaterials and Methods: The 14 animals used for this study were obtained through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Six mice were sent on a 30-day microgravity Bion M1 mission and acclimated to 1-G for 12 hours before they were sacrificed, while eight mice remained on the ground for the 30 days in standard vivarium cages. BSP personnel sacrificed mice and dissected and flash froze tissues. We received isolated frozen tails from the six post-space flight mice (flight, n=6) and eight ground vivarium controls (control, n=8).\nThe C3-C4 motion segment was isolated from each tail. The ventral side of each motion segment was marked with tissue dye to track orientation. Surrounding ligaments and soft tissues were removed to isolate the discs and vertebrae, and each specimen was radiographed to estimate disc height and cross-sectional area. Specimens were kept hydrated with phosphate buffered saline throughout tissue preparation. Each motion segment was placed in a custom 3D-printed four-point bending device such that the plane of bending coincided with the ventral-dorsal plane. This bending device had stainless steel rods inserted through the top and bottom pieces, perpendicular to the plane of bending, to create the four contact points. The lower supports of the bending system were spaced 7.5 mm apart, while the upper supports were spaced 2.5 mm apart and attached to the moving cross-head of a materials test system (ElectroForce 3200; Bose, Eden Prairie, MN). Specimens were preloaded between 0 and 5 mm at a rate of 0.05 mm/sec for 5 cycles, and then loaded to failure at 0.006 mm/sec. Ramping was terminated after failure, characterized by a drop in force of 1.5 N. From force-displacement data, the toe region was defined as the displacement corresponding to an applied force of 1 N, the stiffness was defined as the slope of the most linear region, and the strength was defined as the maximum load before failure. Paired t-tests were used to assess differences in failure strength, failure displacement, toe region length, and disc height between the control and flight groups.\nResults: Space flight reduced bending strength by 17% (6.27 ± 0.94 vs. 7.53 ± 1.13 N, p < 0.05) and reduced toe region by 32% (0.53 ± 0.13 vs. 0.77 ± 0.21 mm, p < 0.05) with no significant effect on bending stiffness (p > 0.25). Disc height was reduced by 16% in flight mice (0.25 ± 0.03 vs. 0.29 ± 0.04 mm, p = 0.054).\nThe two modes of failure identified by histology were: separation within the growth plate; and annulus avulsion at the disc-vertebra junction. Post-flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate while control spinal segments tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Polarized light microscopy showed annulus collagen fibers inserting into the cartilage endplate but not continuing through the endplate to the subchondral bone.\nDiscussion: The reduction in bending strength following space flight supports our hypothesis that reduced bending properties may be an important factor for explaining microgravity-associated increased herniation risk. The reduction in toe region is consistent with reports of decreased range of motion in astronauts, and the shortened disc height is consistent with prior studies investigating post-flight mice [2]. All specimens failed at soft-hard tissue interfaces between cartilage and bone, presumably due to stress concentrations caused by abrupt changes in material properties at these junctions. The increased likelihood of post-flight mice to fail at the growth plate before the disc-vertebra junction suggests a decrease in growth plate integrity, and may explain the reduction in bending strength without a corresponding reduction in stiffness.\nThe results of this study motivate future work investigating the underlying biochemical and structural mechanisms of growth plate failure in flight mice. Previous work suggests that chondrocyte polarity and TGF-ß family signaling are essential for growth plate health [4,5]. A thorough investigation of these traits in post-flight mice may illuminate effects of microgravity that compromise murine growth plate integrity.\nA limitation of animal models used in shuttle missions is the lack of clarity on whether post-flight changes are caused by the same mechanisms as in human astronauts. Microgravity likely has different effects on murine spines due to anatomical and physiological differences. The growth plate separations observed in this study are not relevant to adult humans, but may provide insight for mechanisms of vertebral growth plate fractures observed in children before growth plate closure. Interestingly, mice have been observed using their tails to move about inflight enclosures [2], which may be a confounding variable in accelerating disc degeneration. It should also be noted that the flight mice in this study acclimated to 1-G for 12 hours before they were sacrificed, and the effects on tissue properties during this period are unknown. Despite these limitations, this study provides the first analysis of bending properties of intervertebral discs following space flight and provides insight into possible mechanisms for increased herniation risk following space flight.\nSignificance: Intervertebral disc herniation risk is increased over 4-fold following space flight. Here we show the first evidence that bending properties of spinal segments are decreased following space flight, which may contribute to increased herniation risk.\nReferences: [1] Johnston SL+, ASEM 2010; [2] Bailey JF+, GSB 2012; [3] Adams MA+, Spine 1982; [4] Abad V+, Endocrinology 1999; [5] Zhang J+, Developmental Biol. 2005\nOver the past few years of NASA funding, we have published 8 peer-reviewed papers and 18 abstracts.

            "task_description": "The study was designed to determine effects of extended space travel on oral tissues using the salivary glands of mice. Rodent salivary glands are structurally and functionally similar to those of humans therefore useful for research on changes associated with travel in space. Salivary glands and oral fluid play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the mouth and teeth. Proteins present in secretion granules of salivary glands are released into saliva and can be used to monitor effects of environmental stress. Salivary proteins can serve as markers for physiologic processes such as digestive and immune systems and hormonal regulation. The proteins in saliva are reliable indicators of the environmental effects of travel in space.  The physiologic processes for which they are markers are either slowed, accelerated or unaffected.  Several of the proteins have previously been shown to respond to a variety of environmental stimuli, including space flight. Our previous studies on short duration (~ 1 week) space flight missions showed that specific secretory proteins were modified by exposure to both zero (ØG) and hyper G conditions. Proteins associated with hormonal signaling and gene expression are down-regulated.  An enzyme that is associated with digestion seems unaffected while some cellular proteins appear increased. Employing saliva as a diagnostic test medium could have clinical applications and be useful in measuring human responses to space flight.  The present results agree with previous findings that proteins in salivary glands are specifically altered during space flight and can therefore be used as markers for environmental effects on different physiological  and behavioral responses.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Background and Objectives:   It is important to study the effects of travel in space and to measure reactions to the stress of weightlessness in zero gravity (ØG) conditions. Stress changes hormone action that is reflected in glands that produce saliva as well as in different body parts/organs. The goal is to devise a clinical test for stress disorders in space and on Earth. Saliva contains substances (e.g. proteins) that change during travel in space. We can determine which salivary proteins have been changed by using biochemical tests and histologic analyses to study tissues and cells (salivary glands) that produce saliva in mice flown on the space shuttle Discovery STS-131, 133, and 135 missions. This information will be used to design a test kit to measure responses in astronauts so no blood will have to be drawn. Collecting saliva instead of blood and urine, will be easier during space flight and will make it possible to study hormone changes experienced by Astronauts and Cosmonauts at ØG. Travel in space is an ideal model system for studying a specific environmental impact on physiologic function that is due to gravitational change and cannot be duplicated on Earth. Understanding the effect of ØG will define changes due to the environment as the stressor. This information can then be adapted to devising specific tests of different conditions using saliva for general clinical applications in medicine in space or on Earth.\nResearch Description:   The Biospecimen Sharing Program has provided an unparalleled opportunity to study tissue and secretory protein signaling in tissues affected by environmental stimuli whereby cellular and molecular changes associated with travel in space can be identified in experimental animals and can be monitored by measuring the expression of specific proteins. Previous studies on the effects of space flight have shown that regulation by catecholamine hormones is markedly altered during space flight. The expression of specific proteins as markers can potentially be used for measuring responses to environmental stress since changes in the expression of secretory proteins are reflected in saliva."

Depending on the protein, the physiologic processes for which they are markers are either slowed, accelerated or unaffected.\nMicroarray data showed that space travel affects a large number of salivary gland genes including those involved in cellular signaling. Results from Bion-M1 differ in some aspects from the findings of the U.S. space shuttle STS missions. Several of the salivary protein changes seen during the shorter STS missions have returned to normal during a 30-day Bion flight. This information can be adapted to devise simple and economic testing device using saliva for general clinical applications in medicine in space or on Earth.\n(Ed. note 12/8/2015: compiled from Principal Investigator's final report PDF)",

            "task_description": "Soft tissue injuries often occur at the sites of attachment of tendons and ligament to bone, the so-called \"insertion sites\". The sensitivity of the musculoskeletal system to its mechanical environment may magnify the injury susceptibility of insertion sites during prolonged exposure to microgravity. Changes in loading across joints, as would occur during a long stay on the International Space Station or during a trip to Mars, will lead to changes in tissue mechanical, structural, and biochemical properties. Joint unloading will result in a catabolic biologic state and subsequent tissue degeneration. Physiologic joint loading, on the other hand, will result in an anabolic biologic state and maintenance of tissue properties. Joint deterioration during space flight would significantly increase the risk of injury to the tendons and ligaments which provide function and stability to joints. These injuries do not heal well (e.g., the failure rate for repaired rotator cuff repairs may be as high as 94%) and will severely debilitate an injured astronaut. The negative effect of unloading has most clearly been demonstrated in bone and muscle. Less is known, however, about the effect of weightlessness on joint soft tissues. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to examine the effect of prolonged weightlessness on the mechanical and biochemical properties of muscles, tendons, and their insertions into bone. We are studying the tendon-to-bone insertions of animals subjected to 14 – 30 days of weightlessness through the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) organized for the STS-131, STS-133, STS-135, and the Bion-M1 missions. These shared animals allow us to examine joint degeneration due to weightlessness by comparing the weightless group to a control group on Earth. Outcome measures include assessment of the mechanical, structural, genetic, and compositional properties of mouse tendon-to-bone insertions. These analyses are performed on mice whose procedures and objectives were associated with the primary research focus of this research program.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Musculoskeletal injuries are a common cause of pain and disability, and result in significant health care costs.  Approximately 30% of work related injuries in the United States each year are to the upper extremity. At the rotator cuff, tendon-to-bone repair techniques have been plagued by a high rate of recurrent tears, ranging from 20-94%. There is little scientific basis for the current clinical management of this injury.  Regeneration of the insertion site of the tendon is critical for the restoration of tendon function and for the prevention of re-injury. However, clinical and animal model studies have demonstrated a lack of healing potential after tendon-to-bone injury and repair.\nMusculoskeletal tissues are sensitive to their mechanical environment. Increased loading (e.g., through exercise) generally leads to an increase in mechanical properties, while decreased loading (e.g., through immobilization) generally leads to decreases in mechanical properties. For example, bone adapts to its loading environment by remodeling its architecture to optimally transfer stresses. Unloading leads to rapid resorption of bone and a decrease in bone mineral density. Increased loading, on the other hand, promotes new bone formation and an increase in bone mineral density. These changes are especially evident at the bony end of the tendon-to-bone insertion. Understanding the responses of tendons and their bony insertions to a weightless environment will allow us to develop strategies for preventing tendon-to-bone injuries and/or improving the healing response of tendon-to-bone injuries for humans on Earth."

            "task_progress": "SUMMARY OF PAST YEAR’S RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS\nMuscles, tendons, and bony insertions of animals subjected to 13-30 days of weightlessness on shuttle missions STS-131 and STS-135 (13-15 days microgravity + ~3 hours recovery), and Bion-M1 (30 days microgravity + ~13 hrs recovery) were studied. We completed the following in the fifth year of the grant: assessment of rotator cuff muscles/tendons/insertions from STS-131/135 and Bion-M1 and further assessment of Achilles tendons/insertions from Bion-M1. Specimens from STS-133 are currently being stored for future analysis. Bion-M1 launched on April 19, 2013 and landed on May 19, 2013. A number of animals flew on this mission; 6 of the mice on the satellite were allocated to the NASA BSP investigators. An additional 8 mice were housed at the Russian Federation Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP) to serve as ground vivarium controls. Left and right shoulders (humerus-rotator cuff-scapula units) and ankles (Achilles tendon-calcaneous bone) were removed from each mouse approximately 12 hours after landing, processed, and shipped to our laboratory. Ongoing studies analyzing specimens from this and previous missions include: proteomics on rotator cuff mouse muscles, proteomics of hind paw flexor and extensor tendons, micro-computed tomography of the humeral head and calcaneal bones, biomechanics of the supraspinatus and Achilles tendon-to-bone insertions, and histology of supraspinatus tendon-humeral head and Achilles tendon-calcaneous samples.\n1.\tThe effect of microgravity on tendons and their bony insertions\nFor tendons and their bony insertions, enzymatic degradation of the tissue by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was evident after tendon unloading and/or injury. Microgravity led to significant increases in MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression (data presented in previous progress report) for STS-131 supraspinatus samples (Bion M1 samples are currently being analyzed). This degradation was consistent with decreased collagen fibril diameters in tendons from Bion samples and decreased supraspinatus tendon cross-sectional areas from both STS-131/135 and Bion M1 samples. Surprisingly, decreased cross-sectional area did not result in changes in the force-deformation behavior of the tissue (e.g., failure force). When normalizing mechanical properties for cross-sectional area and length (i.e., stress-strain properties), an increase in the modulus and failure stress (strength) of the tendon-to-bone insertion was seen for both STS and Bion samples. The stiffer tendon-to-bone insertion may be indicative of early tissue pathology, as is seen in glycation-related stiffening of soft tissues in a number of diseases.     2.\tThe effect of microgravity on bone\nJoint unloading on Earth or in space has been shown to cause a rapid loss of bone mineral mass.  Changes in mineral are typically due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, resulting in decreased mineral content as well as changes in the trabecular bone architecture. It is likely that similar bony changes will occur at tendon-to-bone insertions subjected to a weightless environment. Data from the STS-131 and STS-135, presented in the previous progress report, demonstrate that bone resorption is increased (as indicated by increases in the ratio of RANK-L to OPG gene expression) and osteoblast differentiation is decreased (as indicated by decreases in osterix and Runx-2 gene expression)). Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) were decreased due to microgravity. We are currently evaluating the gene expression and bony architecture or humeral heads and calcaneal bones from Bion animals.\n3.\tThe effect of microgravity on the rotator cuff muscles\nContrasting results were seen when comparing gene and protein expression from STS and Bion flights. Microgravity significantly downregulated the expression of both myogenic and adipogenic genes after 15 days of microgravity + ~3 hrs of recovery in STS-131 animals (note: “recovery” indicates time elapsed from landing to sacrifice). The mRNA changes measured in myogenic factors indicated atrophy/degeneration of the muscles due to microgravity. Downregulation of genes related to the adipogenic program indicated that degeneration due to microgravity may occur through different pathways than degeneration due to tendon and/or nerve injury in gravity conditions. In contrast, opposite trends (or no effect) were seen after 30 days of microgravity + ~13 hrs of recovery in Bion-M1 animals. Proteomics analysis of muscles showed similar results. The gene and protein expression changes seen in the Bion-M1 muscles is likely due to initiation of a recovery phase after return of gravity loading. Expression changes can occur within hours of a loading event, whereas mass and functional changes may take days or weeks to manifest.\nWe are completing the analysis of Bion-M1 samples and preparing two manuscripts on the  results.",

            "task_description": "Disuse osteopenia, which is associated with habitation in a microgravity environment, is a condition of low bone density resulting in increased fragility and greater likelihood for bone fracture. Although this condition is largely attributed to the direct effects of unloading of the bone, coupling mechanisms associated with diminished bone and marrow perfusion, attenuated fluid flow within the bone, and fewer signaling molecules from vascular cells may also play a modulating role on the bone loss associated with spaceflight.\nIn the tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rat, an animal model of microgravity-induced osteopenia, hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow decreases with acute unloading (10 min) and continues to progressively decline through 28 days of unloading. The initial and chronic decrements in perfusion are primarily due to increases in osseous vascular resistance. In addition, when the HU rat hindlimb skeleton is reloaded during standing, long bone and marrow perfusion are lower and vascular resistance higher than that in standing control animals. These higher vascular resistances in HU rats could result from, 1) increased vasoconstrictor responses of bone resistance arteries, or 2) decreased endothelium-dependent and/or endothelium-independent vasodilator responsiveness of bone resistance arteries.\nThe general hypothesis of this proposal is that skeletal unloading induces alterations in skeletal resistance artery function; these alterations serve to diminish bone perfusion and ultimately disrupt mechanisms for maintaining the normal balance between bone formation and bone resorption.  The specific purpose is to elucidate vasoconstrictor and vasodilator mechanisms involved in the control of bone and marrow perfusion, including endothelial signaling pathways forming nitric oxide and prostacyclin, in bone during conditions of unloading, and to determine whether deficits in bone blood flow and endothelium-dependent vascular signaling are related to unloading-induced bone loss. To accomplish these goals, the principal nutrient artery of the femur from control and 14 day HU rats will be isolated and cannulated for in vitro experimentation. Mechanisms of smooth muscle and endothelial cell function in the osseous circulation will be determined, as well as how skeletal unloading alters these vasoconstrictor and vasodilator control mechanisms (Aims 1-4). Studies will then be conducted using adenoviral gene transfer (Aim 5) to manipulate bone and marrow perfusion and endothelium-dependent vasodilation to determine whether blood flow and vascular endothelial cell signaling is coupled to disuse-associated bone remodeling in the femur (i.e., bone formation rates, mass, total, cortical and cancellous bone mineral density, and mechanical strength). These studies will extend our knowledge and understanding of how skeletal unloading alters fluid and vascular coupling mechanisms, which have been suggested to modulate the balance of bone formation and degradation during microgravity.  These studies may also provide new insight into the etiology of other degenerative bone disorders which occur concomitantly with cardiovascular dysfunction, such as heart disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and old age.\nEDITOR's NOTE (9/23/2014): Project will continue under grant NNX14AQ57G with the same title due to PI move to Florida State University, from University of Florida.",

            "task_progress": "One manuscript has been published and a second has been submitted for review. In the case of the first published manuscript (Stabley JN, Prisby RD, Behnke BJ, Delp MD. Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling. Bone. 2013 Dec;57(2):355-60), the purpose of this investigation was to determine, 1) whether vascular remodeling occurs in the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the rat femur following 7- and 14-d of skeletal unloading, 2) whether alterations in PNA circumferential wall stress or intraluminal shear stress are regulated variables when putative changes in vascular structure occur, and 3) whether possible changes in vascular structure are associated with alterations in bone blood flow capacity with reloading. It was hypothesized that unloading-induced reductions in hindlimb arterial pressure would diminish PNA circumferential wall stress while reductions in femoral blood flow would reduce PNA intraluminal shear stress. Further, reductions in these mechanical stresses would be normalized through decreases in PNA medial wall thickness and intraluminal diameter, respectively. Additionally, we hypothesized that the shear stress-induced reductions in PNA intraluminal diameter would be associated with a diminished bone blood flow capacity with reloading. The results (see Bibliography for publication information) provided the first evidence that chronic skeletal disuse alters bone and marrow blood flow capacity. Specifically, following 7 d of unloading there was diminished blood flow with reloading in a single region of the femur, the distal metaphysis. When the duration of unloading was increased to 14 d perfusion was diminished in all regions of the femoral bone and marrow  during reloading. These reductions in blood flow following 14 d unloading were the result of elevations in vascular resistance within the bone and marrow and were associated with a remodeling of the resistance vasculature. This remodeling involved changes in both maximal diameter and wall thickness of the PNA. For example, the diameter of the PNA was ~15% lower with 14 d HU and the PNA medial wall thickness was ~21% less than that in Con rat PNAs. While the remodeling of the bone vasculature served to normalize the intraluminal shear stress and circumferential wall stress associated with the unloading-induced changes in bone blood flow and arterial pressure, respectively, the structural narrowing of the resistance vasculature also could function to elevate vascular resistance and limit perfusion of bone and marrow during reloading.\nData contained in the second submitted manuscript (Prisby, RD, BJ Behnke, MR Allen, and MD Delp. Effects of skeletal unloading on the vasomotor properties of the rat femur principal nutrient artery. Submitted) tests functional changes to the femoral PNA vasoconstrictor (Specific Aim #1) and vasodilator (Specific Aims #2 & #4) properties. PNA vasoconstrictor responsiveness to myogenic norepinephrine, clonidine, KCl, endothelin, and arginine vasopressin were unchanged by 14 d unloading, whereas vasoconstriction induced by phenylephrine was diminished. These data indicate that vasoconstrictor responsiveness is not enhanced in the PNA, and therefore, altered intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness does not contribute to the decrease in bone and marrow blood flow and increase in vascular resistance during reloading. In addition, changes in PNA endothelium-independent vasodilation to the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside and the metabolite adenosine  were unaffected by HU. However, PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation, such as that elicited through acetylcholine and flow, were lower in HU rats relative to that in cage controls. This change in endothelium-dependent vasodilation was mediated through the NO signaling pathway and not the COX mechanism. Such changes in endothelium-dependent vasodilation could contribute to the reduction in bone and marrow blood flow and increase in vascular resistance during reloading. Furthermore, the decrements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation are significantly related to changes in cancellous bone mineral density in the femur.\nEDITOR's NOTE (10/20/2014): Project will continue under grant NNX14AQ57G with the same title due to PI move to Florida State University, from University of Florida.

The oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans is considered the major etiological agent of dental caries, and displays a remarkable ability to persist as part of dental plaque biofilm on the tooth surface. Traditionally, the approach to maintaining astronaut oral health during space flight missions has been routed in rigorous preventative dentistry. However, in the face of future long-term space flight missions, research and discovery of new methods for maintaining oral hygiene and dental health under a microgravity environment will be required. Recent studies have shown that simulated microgravity exposure can cause increased mandibular and alveolar bone loss and decreased saliva flow, but little research has been dedicated to studying the effects of space flight and microgravity on virulence attributes of oral pathogens such as S. mutans. Therefore, the overall hypothesis of this New Space Biology Investigation proposal is that S. mutans physiology, biofilm formation, and/or expression of virulence phenotypes will be altered in response to simulated microgravity conditions, and will be tested in two specific aims: (1) Gene expression profiles and cell physiology of S. mutans will be compared when grown in rotating wall vessels to simulate microgravity and “normal” (1×g) gravity conditions, using RNAseq and metabolomics approaches, respectively; (2) S. mutans biofilm formation on hydroxyapatite (HA) and related virulence phenotypes will be compared when grown under simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. The outcomes of this pilot study will serve as a springboard to development of a full Ground-Based Research proposal, focusing on understanding the regulatory mechanisms behind microgravity-specific changes in gene expression, physiology, or virulence phenotypes, in the hopes of targeting these for development of future anti-caries therapies that could be easily adapted to space flight. Because this New Space Biology proposal will divulge new knowledge with respect to the effects of microgravity on S. mutans biofilm formation, competence development, and global changes in gene expression and metabolism, it directly addresses the SB Science Plan's Cell, Microbial, and Molecular Biology overarching questions “How do alterations in gravity affect cell and microbial replication, including genetic and metabolic regulation?” (CMM-1a), “How do alterations in gravity affect cell-cell interactions and communication?” (CMM-1c), and “How do alterations in gravity affect microbial biofilm formation and/or altered potential for disease?” (CMM-1d). These studies also relate to priority recommendation P1 (“Establish a microbial observatory program on the ISS to conduct long-term, multigenerational studies of microbial population dynamics”) of the NRC 2011 Decadal Survey Report, as well as to the Human Research Roadmap, addressing the “Risk of Unacceptable Health and Mission Outcomes Due to Limitations of In-flight Medical Capabilities” (ExMC 4.11: Limited dental care capabilities).",

Although innovative technologies have not been developed from this research, the results of our research suggest that the caries-causing bacterium Streptococcus mutans is more sensitive to oxidative (hydrogen-peroxide) stress when grown under simulated microgravity conditions. This implies that astronaut dental hygiene in space may benefit from the use of hydrogen-peroxide based toothpastes and mouthwashes. Furthermore, the metabolomics and RNA-seq data collected from S. mutans cultures grown in sucrose-containing media (both in simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions) may shed light on the bacterial genes and metabolic pathways that promote dental caries development in space and on Earth."

            "task_progress": "1. During the first 6 months of the project, we obtained two high-aspect ratio vessel (HARV) systems (one to simulate micro-gravity and one for a normal gravity control) from Synthecon, set up this equipment in our lab, and optimized S. mutans inoculation protocols (including ways to minimize the introduction of air bubbles in the HARVs) and rotation speeds for standard growth media and biofilm growth media experiments. We also tested growth of S. mutans in simulated micro-gravity and normal gravity conditions using several different growth medias (artificial saliva media +/- glucose/sucrose, semi-defined biofilm media with various concentrations of glucose/sucrose, and brain heart infusion broth +/- sucrose), and measured the following growth parameters at different time points (up until 24 hours growth): culture pH, culture optical density at 600 nm (OD600), and culture viability by serial dilution plating to calculate colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml).\n2. The bulk of our proposed experiments were performed during the last 6 months of the project. The major experiments and their results are summarized below:\na)\tBased on the preliminary experiments described above, we chose to use semi-defined biofilm media (BM) containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose to perform metabolomics and RNA-seq analysis on S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures (proposed in Aim 1 of the original research proposal). This decision was due, in part, in observed structural differences in the way the S. mutans cells formed clumps in the HARVs under each growth condition.     b)\tFor mass-spectrometry based metabolomics analysis, we collected S. mutans cell pellet and culture supernatant samples from simulated microgravity HARVs and normal gravity HARVs grown for t=4, 8, and 24 hours. Samples were submitted to Metabolon for metabolomics analysis. These results indicated that very few significant alterations were observed under the experimental conditions in this study. Most of the metabolic alterations occurring in this study likely arose from depletion of carbohydrate sources and decreases in energy metabolism and anabolic growth, most likely reflective of growth phase-transitions. There were subtle differences in the timing of these changes between normal and microgravity cells, which may be reflective of differences in growth rate kinetics or growth potential.\nc)\tFor RNA-seq analysis of transcriptome alterations between S. mutans microgravity and normal gravity growth, we collected cell pellets from simulated microgravity HARVs and normal gravity HARVs grown for t=8 hours. These samples were submitted to Seqwright genomic services, where rRNA depletion, synthesis of cDNA libraries, Illumina sequencing, read curation, alignment to the published S. mutans genome, and differential expression analysis (including statistics) was performed. These results indicated that expression of 153 genes were up-regulated = 2-fold under microgravity growth, and 94 genes were down-regulated = 2-fold under microgravity growth. In-depth analysis of this dataset is still on-going (including assignment of differentially-expressed genes into functional categories).  Preliminary inspection of data revealed that a number of genes involved in stress responses were differentially regulated during microgravity growth. A subset of these gene expression changes have also been validated in our lab by real-time PCR.\nd)\t S. mutans cells grown under microgravity conditions displayed altered sensitivity to H2O2 treatment compared to those cultured under normal gravity growth conditions. This pattern held true regardless of the type of growth media used in these experiments.\ne)\tThe effect of simulated microgravity growth on the ability of S. mutans biofilms to adhere to hydroxyapatite (HA) powder as well as glass microcarrier beads was also tested in these studies. The results from both assays indicated that, at the time point and growth media conditions tested, similar levels of biofilm adherence to substrate were observed between the normal and microgravity HARV cultures.\nf)\tPreliminary analysis performed in this research has also revealed that we are able to culture and image (by confocal microscopy) both single species S. mutans biofilms as well as dual-species S. mutans/S. gordonii biofilms.",

            "task_description": "Plants experiencing spaceflight are quite normal in appearance but can exhibit growth habits distinctly different from plants on Earth. Historically the spaceflight-induced differences were difficult to dissect due to changing hardware and flight conditions. With the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) and a consistent International Space Station (ISS) orbital environment, it is now possible to confidently approach a dissection of the molecular biology guiding the altered growth of plants in spaceflight. This proposal involves experiments that specifically address growth and molecular changes in Arabidopsis that occur during spaceflight, bringing the molecular and genetic tools of Arabidopsis to bear on fundamental questions of root morphology, growth, and cell wall remodeling. During the Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit - Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System (APEX-TAGES) experiments, we observed a remarkable number of gene expression changes during spaceflight that are associated with cell wall restructuring, especially in roots. We also observed, with the ABRS/GIS (GFP Imaging System) imaging system, genetically dependent changes in root growth direction, movement, and structure. The current experiments will employ the ABRS and the GIS to dissect and better understand the molecular changes guiding growth restructuring on orbit. In particular we hypothesize that spaceflight conditions engender a constant state of root cell wall modification during the cell file rotations that characterize spaceflight-induced root skewing. The specific experiments will involve mutants in root growth and cell wall signaling pathways identified in our previous spaceflight molecular studies, as well as new Green Fluorescent Protein biosensor lines also based on the genes identified in the previous flight experiments.\nThe overall goal of our program is to understand fundamental molecular biological responses to extraterrestrial environments. This goal aligns with fundamental Space Biology goals to understand the impact of spaceflight on biological systems to better enable the exploration imperative. We have used molecular biology and genetically tagged plants as biological monitors of spaceflight and space-related environments with great science return, leading to the development of new biological and hardware tools to study the spaceflight response with even higher fidelity in a wider variety of spaceflight-related environments. The focus of the current proposal is to build on these data and other insights gained from the execution of the APEX-TAGES experiments in the ABRS /GIS, advancing science while also advancing the telemetric imaging hardware and biological experiment support for the ISS and future platforms\nGaining insights into such mechanisms is recognized as fundamental within the decadal study and underpins answers to some of the biggest questions in spaceflight plant biology.",

            "task_progress": "Final Summary:\nThe APEX03 experiment was a natural follow-on of the APEX01 experiment, and is an outstanding example of how the ISS can be utilized as an exploration laboratory to more science forward in a given field.  In APEX01 we showed that plants responded to the spaceflight environment in a highly tissue-specific manner, and that cell wall remodeling played a large role in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Further, we refuted the paradigm set forth by Darwin in the 1880s that plants require gravity to initiate the root behavior called “skewing,” and fluorescent reporter genes suggested that there were changes in auxin signaling over time on orbit. In APEX03 we set forth to dissect the molecular changes over a developmental time course, utilize mutants in critical skewing and cell wall remodeling signal transduction pathways, and also use targeted fluorescent imaging of auxin-regulated genes in the specific cells of the root tip that guide root navigation.\nAlthough the transcriptome analyses are ongoing, preliminary data suggest that development age plays a substantial role in the physiological adaptation process Transcriptomes were first evaluated four days after germination, where there were numerous differentially expressed genes (compared to ground controls). A set of sister plants were evaluated 8 days after germination on orbit, and it was found that as the plants develop, the number of genes needed to satisfy the needs of the physiological adaptation process diminishes.\nIn the on orbit microscopy experiments (utilizing the Light Microscopy module – the LMM) we found that auxin distributions in the gravity-sensing cells of the primary root are not gravity dependent, even though these distributions are key to gravity responses on Earth. It is therefore likely that the role of gravity is minimal compared to the inherent developmental cues guided by auxin to define the architecture of the root tip.  Those developmental auxin gradients were co-opted then to be sensitive to gravity responses and it seems logical then that the auxin signaling system in roots was present in plants as a developmental system before evolving additional roles in gravity responses. These data actually changed aspects of a long held paradigm in plant biology that gravity is central to setting up the gradient of auxin distribution in a vertically growing root – called the “reverse fountain” model of auxin distribution. The term “vertical” carries a direct association with the gravity vector. Without the ability to remove gravity from the plant environment, there was no reason to eliminate the term from the vernacular or the force of gravity from the concept. Our results show that the reverse fountain is neither reverse nor a fountain, as these terms imply that gravity is involved in the reversal of liquid flow. Rather, the auxin flow of the primary root tip is fundamentally no different from the auxin flow systems that guide other parts of plant primary development, except that it has been further engaged in the gravity response.",

            "task_description": "Single-celled spores of the fern Ceratopteris richardii respond within seconds to both the direction and magnitude of gravity stimuli by altering the direction and magnitude of a trans-cell Ca2+ current that is required for the gravity response. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which gravity alters the trans-cell current, and identify key signaling steps that link the current to cellular polarity changes directed by gravity. This focus on gravity signaling addresses an overarching question in the Space Biology Science Plan. Ca2+-uptake channels and Ca2+-ATPase efflux pumps drive the Ca2+ current across spore cells. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of genes and proteins highly expressed in spores at the peak of the Ca2+ current have identified likely candidates for the pumps and channels. Immunological approaches and yeast-based activity assays will be used to determine whether these transporters are localized on the plasma membrane and are regulated post-translationally. Recent evidence indicates that extracellular eATP [eATP], a newly discovered signaling agent, helps control the gravity response in Ceratopteris, just as it helps regulate gravitropism in Arabidopsis roots. Because eATP controls the activity of Ca2+ channels in plants, we will test the regulatory link between eATP and the activity of Ca2+ channels that is crucial for the gravity response in Ceratopteris. Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulins, annexins, and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases are highly expressed in Ceratopteris at the peak of the Ca2+ current. They are the most likely signal transducers that help mediate the downstream cell polarization events guided by gravity, and their regulatory role in the gravity response will be tested. Expected results will generate hypotheses that predict molecular responses likely to occur in Ceratopteris cells in response to the micro-g environment, and the proposal will describe International Space Station (ISS) experiments that could test these predictions.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "The germinating spore of Ceratopteris is an especially valuable model system for studying the cellular bases of gravity-induced graviresponses on Earth, because both the sensing of gravity and the response occur in the same cell. The cellular level mechanisms of sensory responses are very similar in plant and animal cells, thus the bottom-to-top Ca2+ current that develops early during spore germination as one of the first polarized events induced by gravity in the cell may be an early event also in animal cells known to respond to gravity, such as muscle and bone cells. Our investigation into candidate molecules likely to be associated with both the efflux and influx phases of this current will help clarify how this current is controlled. A number of studies have documented the importance of Ca2+ currents for polarized growth in both animal and plant cells; however, there are few prior studies that have identified and analyzed the molecular components of these currents. Moreover, while it is generally accepted that Ca2+ is a second messenger that participates in a myriad of plant and animal sensory responses, there is still little known about the molecular identity of the Ca2+ channels that mediate many of these responses, especially responses to gravitational stimuli. The proposed tests of Ca2+ pump and channel function and regulation, including possibly channel regulation by eATP, will not only provide novel insights into how the gravity-directed Ca2+ current originates, but also further advance an understanding of channel structures. The results will set the stage for future assays of post-translational changes that occur during space flight in the Ca2+-ATPase pumps and/or mechanosensitive channels in fern and possibly also in some animal cells when the transporter activities go from near zero in micro-gravity to quite high as the g-force rises to 2-g or higher levels achieved during parabolic flight or on a centrifuge on the International Space Station (ISS)."

            "task_progress": "The specific aim of the novel research proposed was to discover the molecular bases of rapid gravity responses in single spore cells of the fern Ceratopteris richardii. The approach to achieve this goal was to identify from recently obtained transcriptomic data molecular components that would be likely to drive the calcium current that is rapidly modulated by gravity. This would then allow an assessment of  post-transcriptional signaling changes in these components that are both induced by gravity and needed for subsequent, gravity-directed polarity changes in cell division and growth. Prior literature suggests many of the post-transcriptional changes induced by gravity in single Ceratopteris cells are similarly induced in multi-cellular organs of flowering plants, so the findings of this project are likely to have relevance to gravitational studies in the more complex tissues of higher plants. Expected findings from the proposed studies would predict rapid molecular-level changes that will be induced in the micro-g environment, and testing the validity of these predictions in Space Flight experiments will be both feasible and likely to provide valuable new insights on the systems life uses to sense and react to gravity.\nOne of the goals of Aim 1 of the original proposal was to molecularly identify cation transporters that could play a major role in driving the trans-cell calcium current that is directed by gravity in fern spores cells. In accord with this goal, we obtained the full-length sequence of a putative MscS (mechanosensitive channel, small current) gene, and obtained evidence in support of the conclusion that it actually has Msc activity by showing that it could partially rescue a bacterial knockout of Msc.  We also obtained partial sequences of two other Msc candidates in Ceratopteris that will serve as the basis to design primers that can “walk” through the Ceratopteris transcriptome and genome to obtain their full sequences, and the primary sequences of the proteins they encode. This will enable the production of antibodies that can be used to identify where each of the Msc channels is localized. If any of these candidates prove to be mechanosensitive channels on the plasma membrane, it (or they) would be the one(s) most likely to undergo post-translational modifications by gravity stimulation.\nThe goal of Aim 2 of the original proposal was to test the role of genes encoding Ca2+-binding proteins that are expressed at the peak of the trans-cell Ca2+ current by suppressing or overexpressing their transcription using transformation methods. We have successfully generated transgenic Ceratopteris spores expressing one of several different transgenes, and these spores will be valuable tools for genetically dissecting gravity responses in spores that respond to gravity while they are still single cells. The mutants include one expressing the calcium reporter Yellow Cameleon, which will enable assessing gravity-induced changes in [Ca2+]cyt; one constitutively expressing a spore annexin, which is a calcium-binding protein implicated in regulating calcium channels in plasma membranes, one suppressed in annexin expression; one knocked down in expression of the Ca2+ATPase pump that helps drive the gravity-induced trans-cell calcium current;  and one knocked down in one of the mechanosensitive ion channels described above in the paragraph on Aim 1. Generating these mutants and genetically confirming their mutant status required over two years of ground-breaking research, and the transgenic products are the first (and still the only) fern mutants modified in spore-expressed genes.\nWe made the most progress on Aim 3 of the original proposal, which was to test the role of eATP in promoting the critical Ca2+-uptake step of the spore gravity response. Key background information that provides the rationale for this goal is that when gravity directs the polarization of Ceratopteris fern spores this process begins with the uptake of calcium through channels at the bottom of the spore, and this step is necessary for the gravity response. Data from several different laboratories showing that extracellular ATP (eATP) regulates calcium channels in plants and animals led to the hypothesis that extracellular nucleotides could play a role in the gravity-directed polarization of Ceratopteris spores. In animal and plant cells ATP can be released from mechanosensitive channels.\nThe idea that a differential distribution of a signaling molecule could lead to morphological polarity is not unique. In this regard, gradients of the growth hormone auxin are among the best documented to be inductive of cell polarity in plants. The differential distribution of eATP during gravity-directed polarization could be an early step in a series of asymmetrical molecular events that ultimately lead to the downstream cellular and morphological changes needed to generate a gravity-directed, downward growing rhizoid in Ceratopteris spores. Precedent data relevant to this hypothesis are those of Tang et al. (Wenqiang Tang, Shari R. Brady, Yu Sun, Gloria K. Muday, and Stanley J. Roux.  Extracellular ATP Inhibits Root Gravitropism at Concentrations That Inhibit Polar Auxin Transport. Plant Physiol. 2003 131: 147-154.) in the journal Plant Physiology, who showed that a high [eATP] inhibits the gravity response in Arabidopsis roots. They interpreted their data as evidence that an eATP gradient could be one of the first steps involved in the gravity response in plant cells. These data led us to test whether gravity could induce a gradient of eATP between the top and bottom of germinating fern spores, and, if so, whether this gradient could help mediate the gravity effect of directing the polarization of the spores.\nIn order to carry out this test, an ATP biosensor, developed by the McLamore laboratory at the University of Florida, was used to measure the [eATP] at the bottom and top of germinating spores during gravity-directed polarization. This biosensor could quantify eATP levels down to the low nM range, and it has a tip diameter of only 1-2 µm, much smaller than the 100-120 µm diameter of spore cells. Using this unique tool with a micromanipulator that could guide the probe to within a few microns of the spore surface, we made the exciting discovery that the [eATP] along the bottom of the spore averaged 7-fold higher than the concentration at the top. Treatments that disrupted the gradient, such as flooding the medium with ATP, or that antagonized eATP receptors, such as adding the ATP receptor blocker PPADS to the medium, or that hydrolyzed ATP in the medium, such as by the addition of phosphatase enzymes, all resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the gravity response. In order to investigate the source of ATP release, spores were treated with Brefeldin A (BFA), which would block cellular secretory activity, and gadolinium trichloride (GdCl3), which would block the transport activity of the mechanosensitive channels that release ATP into the extracellular medium. These treatments resulted in a significant decrease in gravity-directed polarization.\nThe same eATP biosensor was also used to measure ATP release after treatment with both BFA and GdCl3. Both of these treatments caused a significant decrease in [ATP] measured around spores. These results supported the hypothesis that ATP could be released from mechanosensitive channels and secretory vesicles during gravity-directed polarization.\nThe novel findings described above show a clear role for eATP in gravity-directed polarization of Ceratopteris spores by documenting that gravity can induce a bottom-to-top gradient of extracellular ATP around the spores, and that this gradient promotes gravity-directed polarization of the spores. They provide support for the hypothesis that mechanosensitive channels, which have been implicated in other reports as critical components of gravity responses, can help generate eATP gradients that can enhance a cellular gravity response. Overall, they reveal that quantifying and evaluating gradients of eATP can lead to a more thorough understanding of how plants use ATP release to direct growth and development.\nProduction of the novel self-referencing biosensor used to document the gravity-induced eATP gradient between the top and bottom of vertically-oriented spore cells would not have been possible without support from this NASA grant. Recognizing that this biosensor would be a valuable research tool for investigating other eATP-regulated phenomena not only in ferns but also in higher plants, we used it to assay [eATP] levels around growth zones of primary roots of Arabidopsis, because previous research had indicated cells release ATP as they grow. We also used the probe to evaluate whether changing the expression of two apyrase (NTPDase) enzymes (AtAPY1 and AtAPY2), which had been implicated in hydrolyzing and thus limiting the [eATP], actually altered the [eATP]. Our results, which we presented in posters at two international meetings, showed that the [eATP] is highest in root zones that have the highest growth rate (i.e., elongation zones) and that the constitutive expression of AtAPY1 or AtAPY2 lowered this concentration, whereas suppression of these apyrases raised the [eATP]. These results provided novel and important verification of previously postulated hypotheses about the relationship of eATP and apyrase enzymes to growth, and they are being assembled into a manuscript that we expect to submit this summer.",

Based on the knowledge that reduced vestibular information, increased sympathetic activation, and bone loss are common hallmarks of long-term space missions, we hypothesized that space-induced bone loss has a vestibular and sympathetic origin, and that vestibular stimulation might increase bone density.\nThe main objective of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of vestibular stimulation on bone mass, with the goal of designing a new therapeutic approach to prevent bone loss in space. The project is divided into two specific aims. The first one will define the short and long-term effects of vestibular hair cell dysfunction on the vegetative system and on bone mass in mice, in order to determine whether this effect is compensated with time.  Catecholamine levels, brown adipose tissue Ucp1/Gapdh expression, 3D-microcomputed tomography, and quantitative static and dynamic bone histomorphometry will be used. The second specific aim will characterize the effects of vestibular stimulation on the vegetative system and bone. Different centrifuge protocols (continuous and discontinuous, 1.5G/2G/2.5G) and galvanic vestibular stimulation will be used. Centrifugations will be performed in Dr. Makishma (University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), USA) and in Dr. Besnard and Prof. Denise (University of Caen, France) laboratories. Galvanic stimulation will be performed in Dr. Elefteriou's laboratory, in collaboration with Dr. Wood (Houston/UTMB, USA). All the bone analyses will be performed at Vanderbilt University (Dr. Elefteriou, Vanderbilt University). The part of the study performed in France is supported by the University of Caen Basse-Normandie and by the Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES).\nThe ultimate goal of this multi-disciplinary effort is to determine whether vestibular stimulation could have beneficial effects on bone mineral density and sympathetic function during extended space missions. These findings may have application on Earth as well for the treatment or prevention of low bone mass conditions.",

Four to five month-old het/+ (Control) and het/het mice (devoid of otoconia from birth) submitted to continuous centrifugation at 2G for 4 weeks in Dr. Besnard’s laboratory (France) did not experience any significant bone changes at the distal femur, as assessed by 3D computed microtomography (12 um resolution). Bone volume/tissue volume and tissue mineral density were indeed not significantly different between groups (n=10 per group).\nAfter a setback of several months to get the centrifuge operational in Dr. T. Makishima’s laboratory, 4 month-old female WT mice have been submitted to intermittent centrifugation (2h/day) at 2G for 4 weeks. Here again, no differences were detected in terms of bone volume/tissue volume and tissue mineral density between control and treated group, as assessed by 3D computed microtomography (n=10 per group).     Because of the negative nature of these results, this work has not been submitted for publication yet.\nb)\tGalvanic vestibular stimulation. The Hindlimb Suspension (HS) model has been set up successfully in collaboration with Dr. D. Perrien at Vanderbilt. Following our discussions with Dr. Wood and Dr. Makishima in Galveston, we have determined the conditions of GVS stimulation that can induce nystagmus, using an eye tracker recording system. Then, WT mice have been tested for their response to daily GVS stimulations, in absence or presence of hindlimb suspension (HS). HS, as expected, triggered a significant bone loss in distal femurs of WT mice, as assessed by 3D computed microtomography. However, daily GVS stimulations for 21 days did not significantly alter bone mass. Daily GVS stimulations under HS conditions did not affect bone mass either (no protection from bone loss nor further bone loss).",

            "task_description": "A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increase susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.\nIn short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in \"Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration\" including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA (NASA Research Announcement).",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.\nUnderstanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. For example, loss of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma is a commonality abound spaceflight/disuse, aging, Type 2 diabetes, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oxidative stress appears to be at the root of nNOSµ loss in theses muscle myopathies.  Out laboratory seeks to understand the underlying redox mechanisms that leader to perturbation in nNOS function and thus myopathy."

            "task_progress": "Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that adapts rapidly to changes in mechanical loading by altering its cross-sectional area and mass. The reduced mechanical loading of spaceflight causes postural muscles in the lower extremities and flexors in the upper extremities to lose fiber cross-sectional area and force-generating capacity. Muscle atrophy and weakness may then impede mission objectives, increase the risk of injury, and increase susceptibility to damage upon reloading. Muscular alterations with spaceflight are therefore a critical limitation to performance during spaceflight missions and a serious health concern for astronauts.\nExcessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is considered an important component of muscle myopathy with unloading. ROS are produced from the mitochondria and non-phagocytic NADPH-oxidases (NOX) in skeletal muscle fibers and thought to contribute to atrophy through activation of proteolytic pathways. In addition, ROS may initiate a signaling pathway that results in disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-complex (DGC). The DGC serves as an interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix and is responsible for the detection and transmittance of load necessary for regulation of various cellular processes. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others indicates that ROS-induced atrophy is related to disruption of the DGC and translocation of the mu(µ)-splice variant of nNOS from the sarcolemma into the cytosol. nNOSµ is then thought to directly stimulate FoxO3a and ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1, atrogin-1), leading to muscle fiber atrophy.\nThe purpose of this investigation is to identify oxidant-related mechanisms that lead to disruption of the DGC, translocation nNOSµ, proteolysis, and thus atrophy. Our central hypothesis is that ROS, produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria, cause translocation of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis and suppressing protein synthesis. Our experimental design consists of a series of studies utilizing a rodent hindlimb unloading model of spaceflight to: (1) identify NOX dependent signaling of nNOS translocation, FoxO3a activation, and muscle fiber atrophy, and (2) determine the redox regulatory role in DGC disruption with mechanical unloading and atrophy. In addition, additional investigation has been commenced to better translate these findings to spaceflight, where we have begun to use pharmaceutical (Losartan) and nutraceutical (fish oil + curcumin) interventions to limit unloading-induced atrophy.\nData that has been collected thus far indicates that: (1) administration of a potent antioxidant, the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134, prevents unloading induced atrophy during a short-term (54  hr) unloading protocol. Reduced atrophy was related to decreased expression of NOX subunits, ROS production, and markers of ROS-related signaling/damage. In addition, nNOS translocation was prevented with EUK-134 administration as well as related activation of proteolysis through FoxO3a dephosphorylation; (2) EUK-134 also prevented unloading induced atrophy during a longer 7-day unloading protocol, an effect also related to decreased ROS production and nNOS translocation as well as activation of anabolic pathways; (3) More specific targeting of ROS production by using a NOX-2 inhibitor, gp91 ds-tat, and mitochondrial ROS inhibitor, SS-31, has also resulted in reduced muscle fiber atrophy following a 7-day unloading protocol. Interestingly, an interaction between these two sources of ROS has also been suggested with our pilot data; and lastly, (4) pharmaceutical inhibition of angiotensin II receptor I (AT1R), and (5) a nutraceutical interventions with fish oil + curcumin, respectively, have demonstrated similar results.\nIn summary, inhibition of ROS appears to be effective in limiting skeletal muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading. Inhibition of ROS is related to augmented anabolic and reduced catabolic signaling as well as translocation of nNOS, and the source of ROS production may be from both the mitochondria and Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase. Future studies will focus on finalizing the 7-day EUK-134 interventional study including measurement of fractional synthesis rate; further delineating the mechanisms responsible for reduced atrophy with peptidyl inhibition of ROS using gp91ds-tat to target Nox2 and SS-31 to target mitochondria. We will also utilize a genetic ablation of Nox2 (gp91phox-/-) to further establish its role in unloading induced atrophy; and establishing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical interventions in preventing unloading-induced atrophy. In addition, fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and rate of protein degradation will be assessed in future experiments.",

            "task_description": "The overall goal of our program is to understand fundamental molecular biological responses to extraterrestrial environments. This goal aligns with Space Biology goals to understand the impact of spaceflight on biological systems to better enable the exploration imperative. Within that context, the goal of this proposal is to explore the mechanism by which undifferentiated cells, cells presumably lacking the specializations typical of gravity response mechanisms, perceive the novel environment of spaceflight. We used undifferentiated callus cells from Arabidopsis to reveal unique gene expression patterns in response to true spaceflight as part of the BRIC-16 experiment in 2010. We followed up with examination of the response of these cells to a variety of terrestrial environments and stimuli, including spaceflight analogs such as clinorotation, hyper-g centrifugation, and parabolic flight. The present proposal moves beyond phenomenon observation to address specific hypotheses derived from these initial spaceflight and ground experiments. In BRIC-16 biologically replicated DNA microarray and RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that are significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. While the response in intact Arabidopsis seedlings was significant but moderate in intensity, the response of undifferentiated cell cultures was dramatic, intense, and in completely different gene sets than in the intact seedlings. That undifferentiated plants cells uniquely perceive gravity raises powerful questions of gravity perception and response, and sets the stage for hypothesis-driven experimentation directed toward understanding this perception and response.\nWe hypothesize that the response of cell cultures is not driven by the same gravity response mechanisms known in intact plants. We will use culture lines derived from gravity signaling mutants to test this hypothesis. This will investigate the underlying mechanisms by which undifferentiated cells detect and respond to the spaceflight environment in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity. The read-out data will again be in the form of gene expression patterns that can be directly compared to our previous flight and ground data. These experiments are carefully scaled to the BRIC operational context and enable us to dig deeply and specifically into mechanisms associated with plant responses to the novel environment of spaceflight. Gaining insights into such mechanisms is recognized as fundamental within the previous decadal study and underpin answers to some of the biggest questions in spaceflight plant biology.",

            "task_progress": "The BRIC-17 experiment led to some remarkable scientific developments. First, it showed that undifferentiated cells do respond to microgravity, can sense and recognize the sub-g environment and adjust the cellular processes to continue to perform in the new gravitational condition. The BRIC-17 experiment gave an insight as of how mutated cells, very different on the ground, also coped with the microgravity environment. Second, the BRIC-17 experiment demonstrated that standard approaches of comparing the genes expression in the treated sample relative to the untreated should be taken with great caution, particularly if the mutant cell lines are part of the study. The WT and mutant comparisons with a standard analysis approach looked fundamentally different, yet there were hidden similarities. The novel and original approach of expanding the comparison across the ground or the spaceflight gene expression level with multiple cross-comparisons resulted in a very different conclusion. The cells shared many genes for which expression was brought to the same level, and which could possibly reflect the required changes to cellular processes in microgravity. However, the way each cell line achieved the even expression of specific genes was very different. Therefore the two very distinctive terms were coined, the response to microgravity and the state in microgravity. The response to microgravity was considered as a pool of all genes that expression changed in orbit as compared to the respective ground controls. The microgravity state was considered as a specific level of some genes expression, likely required to readjust structures and processes to the new gravitational filed, so the new order and homeostasis required in the microgravity environment could be achieved. Assuming that being in microgravity would require some structural and physiological changes in the cells, they would be attained but in different ways depending on cell types.\nThere are three manuscripts in preparation derived from this research, which will likely be published in mid to late 2015.",

This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.\nThese experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.\nA significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.",

These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture.

Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1 g.  A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1 g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination.  Additionally, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be a product of directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravity.\n***Project 2: Gene Profiling***\nThe transcriptome of seedlings were analyzed from experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) to study the interacting effects of light and gravity on plant tropisms.  Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated and grown in cassettes in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) for 4 days at 1g then exposed to a range of gravitational accelerations (microgravity, 0.07g, 0.13g, 0.21g, 0.39g, 0.53g, and 1g) and light treatments (blue light with or without a 1 hour pretreatment with red light).  At the end of the space experiments, the cassettes containing the seedlings were frozen in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) and returned to Earth on space shuttle STS-131.  The RNA was extracted from whole seedlings and used for the transcriptome analyses. A comparison of 1g-treated-spaceflight samples with ground controls identified 230 genes that were differentially regulated at least two-fold (p < 0.01). A further comparison of all spaceflight samples with ground controls identified approximately 280 genes that were differentially regulated at least two fold (p < 0.01).  Of these genes, several were involved in regulating cell polarity (i.e., auxin, calcium, lipid metabolism), cell wall development, oxygen status, and cell defense or stress. However, when the transcriptome of the all g-treated spaceflight samples were compared with microgravity samples, only approx.130 genes were identified as being differently regulated (p < 0.01). Of these, only 27 were at least 2 fold differently regulated between microgravity and 1g samples and included putatitive/pseudo/undefined genes (n=14), transposable elements (n=5), an expansin (ATEXP24; At1g21240), a cell-wall kinase (WAK3; At1g21240), a laccase-like flavonoid oxidase (TT10;At5g48100), among others.   Not surprisingly, there was a difference in the % of genes represented in individual gene categories when comparing spaceflight samples with ground controls and spaceflight microgravity versus spaceflight g-treated space samples.   These results emphasize the need for tissue fixation on the centrifuge for an accurate spaceflight control.  These results are one of the few reports of transcriptome analyses from a space experiment with plants that had gravity treatments using an on-board centrifuge.\nEDITOR'S NOTE (December 2017): Project is being continued by  \"Novel Explorations Into The Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--80NSSC17K0546\" with the same PI, Dr. John Kiss, due to Principal Investigator's move to University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

            "task_description": "Spaceflight, by impairing the differentiation program of stem cells residing within bone marrow results in bone loss, increased bone marrow adiposity, anemia, and impaired immune function.  Because these disturbances may potentially compromise the success of long-duration flights, there exists an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and implement effective countermeasures.  We propose to test the novel hypothesis that negative energy balance during spaceflight results in 1) bone marrow dysfunction and increased marrow adiposity and 2) altered signaling by  peripheral adipokines (cytokines produced by adipocytes) all of which, in turn, contribute to negative bone turnover balance and bone loss.  The proposed research will focus on the precise role of adipose tissue and the important adipokine leptin in mediating the detrimental effects of simulated spaceflight (hindlimb unloading (HU)) on bone marrow cells in mice by accomplishing the following 2 specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that increased bone marrow adiposity plays a causal role in mediating simulated spaceflight-induced changes in bone metabolism.  This will be accomplished by comparing the skeletal response to hindlimb unloading of wild type (WT) mice with mice incapable of generating bone marrow adipocytes (kit-receptor-deficient KitW/W-v mice).  Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, by targeting the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells, plays a key role in mediating energy sensitive changes in bone metabolism during simulated spaceflight.  This will be accomplished by examining whether transplantation of mesenchymal or hematopoietic stem cells from leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice into WT mice alters bone loss during simulated spaceflight. Completion of the proposed project is expected to increase our understanding of the role of energy metabolism in mediating bone loss during simulated spaceflight and suggest specific non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of spaceflight on bone marrow.",
            "research_impact/earth_benefits": "Osteoporosis is a major health concern.  To our knowledge, all forms of osteoporosis involve infiltration of fat into bone marrow.  If the increased marrow fat alters the magnitude of bone loss, as hypothesized, this research will have significance to human health that transcends protecting astronauts from bone loss during spaceflight.\nSuccessful completion of the proposed research involved substantial model development and validation and this work will have impact far beyond the specific aims of this project.  To accomplish Specific Aim 1, it was necessary to perform adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow cells into kitw/w-v mice (Specific Aim 1).  While bone marrow transplantation is routinely performed in the field of immunology, the impact of whole body sub-lethal and lethal radiation typically used to perform the procedure on the skeleton has received little attention.  In the course of validating our model we performed several pilot studies that led to the unexpected finding that high dose radiation with photons, while having devastating effects on the hematopoietic compartment actually induces bone lining cells to become osteoblasts, leading to a transient increase in bone formation.  Based on the likelihood that this activation of bone lining cells represents a potential therapeutic target we hope to pursue the mechanism for this response.  Additionally, we made major advances in optimizing adoptive transfer for bone research: we have developed a protocol where following lethal irradiation we have quantitatively replaced hematopoietic cells in bone marrow with donor cells with no bone loss.  This was accomplished with as few as 750 purified hematopoietic stem cells (publication in review and publication in preparation).\nMice exhibit premature age-related cancellous bone loss. Specifically, as much as 2/3 of the cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis is resorbed prior to establishment of peak total bone mass.  The negative implication of this bone loss for HU studies is obvious. The mechanism, however, was unknown. In the course of performing studies in which mice were housed at thermoneutral (32°C) to minimize adaptive thermogenesis, we noted that the mice housed at this warm temperature showed unusually high cancellous bone volume fraction.  Further investigation confirmed that premature cancellous bone loss in mice housed at room temperature is caused by mild cold stress (Iwaniec et al., 2016). While the low cancellous bone mass at clinically relevant sites in skeletally mature mice is an issue for preclinical studies, an even more important issue is whether physiological adaptation to mild cold stress influences the outcome of preclinical studies. This is of particular concern to spaceflight studies where mice housed at subthermoneutral temperatures during microgravity are likely to be more dependent upon adaptive thermogenesis than weight bearing controls, leading to bone loss independent of reduced weight bearing.\nReference: Iwaniec UT, Philbrick KA, Wong CP, Gordon JL, Kahler-Quesada AM, Olson DA,   Branscum AJ, Sargent JL, DeMambro VE, Rosen CJ, Turner RT.

            "task_progress": "Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that increased bone marrow adiposity plays a causal role in mediating simulated spaceflight-induced changes in bone metabolism.\nWe evaluated the impact of a 14d spaceflight (in slowly growing ovariectomized rats) and a 14d simulated spaceflight (hindlimb unloading (HU) in adult male mice) on bone marrow adiposity.  As described in detail in Keune et al., 2016, bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increased in the distal femur metaphysis during spaceflight.  During the same interval there was a reduction in cancellous bone volume fraction.  The observed bone loss was due to increased bone resorption; osteoblast number, osteoblast activity and osteoblast turnover were normal.  In agreement, HU resulted in bone loss in male mice and the bone loss was due to increased bone resorption.  However, we were surprised to find that HU did not result in an increase in MAT (publication under review) in WBB6F1/J mice.  It should be noted that this unexpected finding was replicated in HU C57BL6 mice (publication in preparation). We conclude from these results that increased MAT is not a prerequisite for bone loss in HU mice.\nWe originally hypothesized that mice incapable of producing MAT would be protected from HU-induced cancellous bone loss whereas mice with excessive MAT would exhibit increased bone loss.  We tested these hypotheses using kitw/w-v (MAT-deficient) mice and ob/ob (excessive MAT) mice.  As expected, decreased MAT was associated with increased bone formation and increased MAT was associated with decreased bone formation.  However, HU-induced cancellous bone loss was exaggerated in MAT- mice and not impacted by excessive MAT (publication in preparation).\nTaken together, our studies demonstrate that spaceflight-induced cancellous bone loss in ovariectomized rats and HU-induced cancellous bone loss in male mice each occur as a result of increased bone turnover, where the increase in resorption is inadequately compensated for by bone formation.  While lineage decision (mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts or adipocytes) was shown to influence bone formation and MAT levels, our findings do not support a causal relationship between MAT infiltration and bone loss during spaceflight.  Indeed, our studies in MAT-deficient mice suggest that MAT may have a protective role in limiting bone loss.  Further research will be required to verify these findings and determine the underlying mechanisms.\nSpecific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the adipokine leptin, by targeting the differentiation of bone marrow stem cells, plays a key role in mediating energy sensitive changes in bone metabolism during simulated spaceflight.\nWe performed a series of studies to test this hypothesis. Initial studies were focused on establishing the effects of leptin on MAT and bone turnover in normal rats and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (Turner et al., 2014; Turner et al., 2015; Philbrick KA et al., 2015; Lindenmaier et al., 2016). We also addressed the controversy as to whether the physiological actions of leptin on bone are mediated through peripheral or central nervous system (CNS)-mediated signaling (publication under review).  This question is important because leptin regulates energy metabolism through CNS signaling.  Subsequent studies focused on how leptin impacts bone and energy metabolism during HU (publication in preparation).\nTaken together, our studies provide strong evidence that leptin administered subcutaneously and hypothalamic leptin gene therapy have surprisingly similar effects on bone metabolism in ob/ob mice; specifically, leptin decreased MAT, increased osteoblast number and activity, and increased osteoclast activity.  Dose response studies revealed that the skeletal effects of leptin occur at very low circulating levels of the hormone (levels having minimal effects on food intake or body weight), suggesting that previously published reports demonstrating skeletal effects of leptin delivered into the hypothalamus were due to transport of leptin into peripheral circulation and not due to CNS mediated actions.  If confirmed, our finding that the actions of peripheral leptin on bone and central actions of leptin on energy metabolism are dissociable from one another would represent a paradigm shift.\nIt is well established that there is a close association between the magnitude of mechanical loading of the skeleton and bone mass, and that bone loss often accompanies weight loss induced by dieting (Iwaniec and Turner, 2016).  Potentially, this is due to combined decreases in peripheral and CNS leptin levels.  In support, we have shown that increasing hypothalamic levels in adult rats can reduce body weight but, in contrast to caloric restriction, promote weight loss without bone loss (Turner et al., 2015). It is well established that weight loss due to reduced food intake contributes to bone loss during HU and for this reason, weight bearing controls are normally pair-fed to HU rodents.  However, as shown for weight bearing rodents (Turner et al., 2015), leptin treatment of HU ob/ob mice, although inducing weight loss, did not result in further bone loss (publication in preparation).\nReferences\nKeune, JA, Philbrick KA, Branscum AJ, Iwaniec UT, Turner RT.

            "task_description": "Microgravity has been shown to alter global gene expression patterns and protein levels in cultured cells or animals. It has been suggested that packaging of the chromatin fibre in the interphase nucleus is closely related to genome function, and the changes in transcriptional activity are tightly correlated with changes in chromatin folding. Several principles of chromatin folding have been widely accepted and have revealed that an extensive degree of folding of human 46 chromosomes. In an interphase nucleus of about 5-20 µm in diameter, a total length of 5 cm of nucleosomal filaments is packaged as beads being aligned on a string. Furthermore, data obtained from various molecular technological approaches by various research groups, including our own team, have provided more and more evidences that local chromatin folding is related to the transcriptional activity and gene density. However, there is no data available currently on chromosomal conformation changes in micro-G, which may extensively influence cellular function, differentiation and development, due to the subsequent regulation of gene expressions caused by altered chromatin folding. This study explores the changes of chromatin conformation and chromatin-chromatin interactions in the simulated microgravity and super-G environments, and their correlation to the changes in the expression of genes located at different regions of the chromosome.",

            "task_progress": "FINAL REPORT PROGRESS REPORTED JANUARY 2016:\nIn this project, we concluded that on a multi-megabase pair scale of DNA, the arrangement of chromatin in M10 epithelial cells was found to be non-random. In human epithelial cells, both telomere regions tended to be located towards the exterior of the chromosome domain, whereas the remaining p-arm chromatin region was located towards the interior. In contrast, most of the q-arm of the chromatin was found in the periphery of the domain. Chromosome conformation in a significant number of cells was found to be altered under a simulated microgravity condition. The alterations included rounder shape of the nucleus, poor correlations of two homologous chromosomes and their regions, and changes in the relative location of region 2 that contains the 3p21 hotspot in a significant number of chromosome 3s.\nANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTED AUGUST 2014: We revisited the data obtained from a preliminary study on the effects of proximity within interphase chromosome on the breakpoint distribution in radiation-induced intra-chromosomal exchanges and completed data analysis. The data indicates that the telomere regions as well as the q-arm of the chromosome appeared to be located towards the exterior of the chromosome domain. Most of the regions in the p-arm of the chromosome as well as the centromere region, however, were closer to the center of the chromosome domain.  In addition, the interior of the chromosome domain was preferentially occupied by the p-arm of the chromatin, which is consistent with our previous finding of intrachromosome exchanges involving breaks on the p-arm and in the centromere region of chromosome3. This work was recently published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nTo simulate microgravity on the ground, we evaluated the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) and the available HARV bioreactors and decided to acquire a new RPM to model different gravity conditions. RPM allows simulation of microgravity in adherent cells cultured cells in 2D. Another important reason is that it is possible to use RPM to simulate various gravity conditions. The process to acquire RPM, including the market survey and procurement from a European company, took several months. The system was successfully tested and is being used for various projects. In this study, the epithelial cells were growing from 20% confluence for five days to reach confluence under both RPM and static culture conditions. No significant changes of morphology, growth rate, and cell death were found.\nTo determine whether the pattern of interphase chromatin folding is cell type specific, we analyzed the 3D structure of interphase chromosome 3 in G0 lymphocytes. The preliminary result suggested that the folding of interphase chromosome 3 may be cell type specific. In comparison to the chromosome in static epithelial cells, the interphase structure of the chromosome in epithelial cells cultured in the simulated microgravity condition for 5 days appeared to be different. Total RNAs have been isolated for global gene array analysis. The analyses are time-consuming and in progress.\nFuture work for the final year of the project:   •\tComplete the gene array analysis and determine the correlation of gene expression changes and the changes of interphase chromatin folding in chromosome 3;   •\tComplete the chromosome aberration analysis to determine the relationship between the distribution of intrachromosomal exchanges and the changes of interphase chromatin folding in chromosome 3 under simulated microgravity environment;   •\tPrepare a full proposal to explore the changes of chromatin folding in cells during actual spaceflight, which may further explore other chromosomes and/or cell types.",

            "task_description": "The amount of bone loss between individual astronauts is highly variable with some astronauts losing large amounts of bone while others are largely unaffected. This variability is accounted for, at least to a large extent, by genetic variations between individuals. Unfortunately, the specific genes that modulate this genetic sensitivity of bone loss in microgravity are unknown.  To this end, we have recently completed a genetic study in which we identified specific regions on chromosomes (QTL or Quantitative Trait Loci) that either add to or reduce the propensity of an individual to lose bone when normal weightbearing is removed from the musculoskeleton. While providing critical information, these QTL still contain hundreds of genes, rather than a single one. Here, we propose first to greatly reduce the number of candidate genes with bioinformatics tools and then experimentally test the shortlist of candidate genes using knockout mice available from the Jackson Laboratory’s (JAX) Genetic Resource Repository and the JAX Knock Out Mouse Project (KOMP) production center. The identification of single genes modulating bone loss during weightlessness can be used as a critical diagnostic tool for the identification of astronauts most in need of countermeasures as well as to unravel novel drug targets that preserve bone health in space.",
