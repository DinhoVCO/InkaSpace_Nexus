<p id="Par1">Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and immune systems. However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 <em>g</em> [lunar gravity], and 1 <em>g</em>) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 <em>g</em> but only partially recovered by 1/6 <em>g</em>. Both 1 <em>g</em> and 1/6 <em>g</em> suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1 <em>g</em> and 1/6 <em>g</em>, but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6 <em>g</em>. While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight.</p>

<p id="Par2">Space exploration has attracted attention in various fields, including materials, fuels, communication equipment, systems, medicine, and botany. To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program “Artemis” has been initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment<sup><a aria-describedby="CR1" class="usa-link" href="#CR1">1</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR2" class="usa-link" href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. Notably, astronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological stress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of astronauts. A prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones<sup><a aria-describedby="CR3" class="usa-link" href="#CR3">3</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR4" class="usa-link" href="#CR4">4</a></sup>, skeletal muscle function<sup><a aria-describedby="CR3" class="usa-link" href="#CR3">3</a></sup>, vestibular control<sup><a aria-describedby="CR5" class="usa-link" href="#CR5">5</a></sup>, optic nerve papillary edema<sup><a aria-describedby="CR6" class="usa-link" href="#CR6">6</a></sup>, and cardiac hypertrophy<sup><a aria-describedby="CR7" class="usa-link" href="#CR7">7</a></sup> among astronauts. These health issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these changes are unknown.</p>
<p id="Par3">Several drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify effects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been conducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals<sup><a aria-describedby="CR8" class="usa-link" href="#CR8">8</a></sup>. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms, on the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the ISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned to Earth alive.</p>
<p id="Par4">To conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to space environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term gravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully housed 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial 1 <em>g</em> for 35 days using the Multiple Artificial-gravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using a centrifugal device (Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)-1 mission)<sup><a aria-describedby="CR9" class="usa-link" href="#CR9">9</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR10" class="usa-link" href="#CR10">10</a></sup>. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the MHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles<sup><a aria-describedby="CR10" class="usa-link" href="#CR10">10</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR11" class="usa-link" href="#CR11">11</a></sup>, bone<sup><a aria-describedby="CR10" class="usa-link" href="#CR10">10</a></sup>, eye<sup><a aria-describedby="CR12" class="usa-link" href="#CR12">12</a></sup>, spleen<sup><a aria-describedby="CR13" class="usa-link" href="#CR13">13</a></sup>, thymus<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>, reproductive system<sup><a aria-describedby="CR15" class="usa-link" href="#CR15">15</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR16" class="usa-link" href="#CR16">16</a></sup>, and behavior<sup><a aria-describedby="CR17" class="usa-link" href="#CR17">17</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR18" class="usa-link" href="#CR18">18</a></sup>. For future manned exploration of the Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than 1 <em>g</em> on living organisms. Recently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long-radius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU-4 and -5 missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis of the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different gravitational forces<sup><a aria-describedby="CR19" class="usa-link" href="#CR19">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par5">This study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We found that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and partially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore, the responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel.</p></section><section id="Sec2"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Results and discussion</h2>
<section id="Sec3"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Overview of three mouse habitat unit (MHU) missions</h3>
<p id="Par6">Figure <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig1">1</a>A presents an overview of three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5). C57BL/6J male mice in the Transporting Cage Unit (TCU) were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon Space Vehicle from the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, and subsequently transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were transferred to the Habitat Cage Unit (HCU), one mouse per cage, and then placed in a centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35 days (MHU-1), 25 days (MHU-4), and 26 days (MHU-5). For the MHU-1 mission, 12 mice were divided into two groups: microgravity (MG) and artificial 1 <em>g</em> (AG) mice. The AG group was kept in an artificial 1 <em>g</em> environment in the MARS-S centrifuge. In the MHU-4 and -5 missions, six partial gravity (PG) mice were kept in an artificial 1/6 <em>g</em> environment in MARS-S and MARS-L centrifuges, respectively. MARS-L is approximately 2.2 times larger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. The ground control (GC) mice were an experimental group of C57BL/6J male mice of the same age, maintained under the same breeding conditions in the HCU as the space experiment in each mission. Experiments were conducted using six mice per mission group. A more detailed schedule for each mission is provided in Supplementary Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. Unavoidably, it took 1–2 days of transport time after the cargo landed to collect each organ. This information is detailed in the Method section. For both missions, the change in body weight before and after the space experiment occurred at approximately the same rate of increase<sup><a aria-describedby="CR19" class="usa-link" href="#CR19">19</a></sup>. In addition, three mice in MHU-5 experienced significant weight loss after returning to Earth due to anomalies in the TCU water supply system. These mice were not used for the analysis of RNA-seq.</p>

<p id="Par7">Prior to dissecting the mice after anesthetizing them with isoflurane, we visually inspected their appearance, body hair, whisker morphology, incisor tooth morphology, abdominal hardness, and limb morphology. None of the mice returning to Earth from the three missions showed any abnormalities. Following body weight measurements, a mid-air righting reflex test and rotarod test were performed to assess vestibular function and coordinated movements (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig1">1</a>B,C). In MHU-1, the latency to right tended to increase non-significantly in MG mice (176 ± 19 ms) compared to those in artificial 1 <em>g</em> (AG) and ground control (1GC) mice (143 ± 12 ms and 130 ± 7 ms, respectively) (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig1">1</a>B). Regardless of the same gravitational environment, the latency to right of partial gravity (4PG) mice (212 ± 8 ms) in MHU-4 was significantly higher than that of 4GC mice (155 ± 3 ms), whereas that of 5PG mice (145 ± 19 ms) in MHU-5 was comparable to that of 5GC mice (150 ± 4 ms). In the rotarod test, the duration on the rod in AG (48 ± 4 s) and MG (44 ± 6 s) mice was significantly shorter than that in 1GC (74 ± 10 s) mice in the MHU-1 mission (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig1">1</a>C). However, the differences between PG and GC in MHU-4 (4PG: 49 ± 5 s, 4GC: 37 ± 7 s) and MHU-5 (5PG: 83 ± 11 s, 5GC: 70 ± 14 s) were not significant. In the righting reflex test, which evaluates postural control via the vestibular system, mice from the MARS-S and MARS-L in the same 1/6 <em>g</em> group showed different results. 4PG showed the same deterioration as MG, whereas 5PG showed the same results as GC and AG in the 1 <em>g</em> group. The two possible reasons for this discrepancy are as follows: (1) Difference between the short and long arms: the gravity gradient in the housing chamber of MARS-S, which has short arms, is larger than that of MARS-L, which has long arms. Therefore, each time the height of the head changes, 4PG receives a larger gravitational input into the otolith system. This may have affected vestibular function. (2) Difference in the control performance of the centrifuge used in 4PG and 5PG. The difference is particularly noticeable in a small gravity, such as 1/6 <em>g</em>; the gravity fluctuation was larger in 4PG than that in 5PG, which may have affected vestibular function in 4PG. These two possibilities should be examined in future research.</p></section><section id="Sec5"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Lunar gravity loading partially recovered bone mass loss caused by microgravity</h3>
<p id="Par8">To investigate the effect of gravity on bones, the right femur of the mice was analyzed using micro-computed tomography (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2</a>A,B). MG mice in the MHU-1 mission showed a significant decrease of 70% (1GC; 15.1 ± 2.2%, AG; 14.5 ± 1.2%, MG; 4.5 ± 2.7%) in the trabecular bone volume corrected by the tissue volume (BV/TV), whereas PG mice in the MHU-4 and -5 missions showed a significant decrease in BV/TV of only 30% (4GC; 20.6 ± 2.3%, 4PG; 14.4 ± 3.5%) and 28% (5GC; 27.4 ± 5.6%, 5PG; 19.6 ± 2.5%), respectively, although housing in MHU-4 and -5 was 10 days shorter than that in MHU-1. In cortical bone, cross-sectional area (Ct.Ar) and thickness (Ct.Th) decreased significantly by 17% (Ct.Ar: 1GC; 0.87 ± 0.02 mm<sup>2</sup>, MG; 0.72 ± 0.03 mm<sup>2</sup>) and 16% (Ct.Th: 1GC; 141.9 ± 2.1 µm, MG; 118.9 ± 7.7 µm) in MG mice in MHU-1. In PG mice, Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were reduced by 5% without significant difference in MHU-4 (Ct.Ar: 4GC; 0.91 ± 0.02 mm<sup>2</sup>, 4PG; 0.86 ± 0.07 mm<sup>2</sup>, and Ct.Th: 4GC; 150.4 ± 1.2 µm, 4PG; 142.7 ± 9.9 µm), while Ct.Ar and Ct.Th were significantly reduced by 7% and 5%, respectively, in MHU-5 (Ct.Ar: 5GC; 0.72 ± 0.03 mm<sup>2</sup>, 5PG; 0.67 ± 0.02 mm<sup>2</sup>, and Ct.Th: 5GC; 116.0 ± 3.8 µm, 5PG; 109.7 ± 2.7 µm). Although BV/TV decreased in the 1/6 <em>g</em> environment, the degree of decrease was smaller than that in the microgravity environment, suggesting that bone loss was partially prevented in the 1/6 <em>g</em> environment compared with that in microgravity. Moreover, plasma levels of the bone resorption marker, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) significantly increased while those of the bone formation marker, osteocalcin significantly decreased in the MG and two of the PG mice compared to those in GC mice (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2</a>C). However, compared to the increased proportion of TRAP (139%, 1GC; 3.9 ± 0.5 Unit/L, MG; 5.4 ± 0.5 Unit/L) and decreased proportion of osteocalcin (49%, 1GC; 60.8 ± 19.7 ng/mL, MG; 30.0 ± 2.7 ng/mL) in MG mice relative to that in 1GC mice, the proportions of TRAP (MHU-4: 127%, 4GC; 4.7 ± 0.3 Unit/L, 4PG; 6.0 ± 0.4 Unit/L and MHU-5: 139%, 5GC; 4.0 ± 0.9 Unit/L, 5PG; 5.6 ± 0.9 Unit/L) and osteocalcin (MHU-4: 44%, 4GC; 34.8 ± 5.9 ng/mL, 4PG; 15.4 ± 4.0 ng/mL and MHU-5: 51%, 5GC; 36.6 ± 4.7 ng/mL, 5PG; 18.8 ± 8.5 ng/mL) in PG mice were comparable, indicating that these changes in proportions were inconsistent with the differences in bone loss rates between microgravity and the 1/6 <em>g</em> environment. Moreover, the similarity in osteocalcin values between AG and MG mice in MHU-1 indicated that the regulation of osteocalcin expression may be independent of gravity.</p>

<p id="Par9">To verify how gravity affects gene expression in load-bearing bones, we collected and prepared femurs and tibiae<sup><a aria-describedby="CR20" class="usa-link" href="#CR20">20</a></sup> for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of an osteocyte-rich bone fraction. A total of 485 genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping among MG, AG, 1GC in MHU-1 and 4PG, 4GC in MHU-4, revealing five distinct gene clusters (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3</a>A). Similar clusters between samples were not classified by the magnitude of gravity, but by each of the MHU-1 and -4 missions. The results indicated that the changes in gene expression at 1/6 <em>g</em> were lesser than those in microgravity. However, as observed in previous comparisons of our thymic RNA-seq data<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>, this may be due to differences in flight schedules between missions. Since this makes changes in gene expression classified into clusters 2 and 5 less credible, the present study focused on clusters 1, 3, and 4. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified actin regulation-related genes in cluster 1 (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3</a>B). Considering that the cytoskeleton is an initial gravity sensor<sup><a aria-describedby="CR20" class="usa-link" href="#CR20">20</a></sup>, this upregulation could be caused by transmitting variations in external mechanical forces into intracellular chemical signals. Cluster 3 and 4, downregulated in MG mice, included genes responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the cell cycle; abnormalities in the cell cycle of osteoblasts have been previously reported in microgravity experiments<sup><a aria-describedby="CR21" class="usa-link" href="#CR21">21</a></sup> (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3</a>B).

<p id="Par11">Hence, to elucidate the effects of microgravity, 1/6 <em>g</em>, and 1 <em>g</em> onboard environment on the gene expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction, eight osteoblast lineage marker genes and seven osteoclast marker genes were selected and visualized using heat mapping (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3</a>C). We compared the expression levels of osteoblast markers <em>Bglap, Bmp4</em>, <em>Sost</em>, and <em>Spp1</em>, which are mainly expressed by osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone and regulate osteoblastic bone formation. The expressions of <em>Sost</em>, <em>Bmp4,</em> and <em>Spp1</em> were significantly higher in MG mice than those in 1GC mice. However, <em>Bglap</em> expression was significantly lower in MG mice than that in 1GC, and tended to be lower than that in AG mice. In addition, these changes were absent when comparing 4GC and 4PG mice in the MHU-4 mission (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3</a>D). Changes in <em>Bglap</em> expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction and the plasma concentrations of its product, osteocalcin, were similar between the experimental groups (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2</a>C). Though bone loss during spaceflight is mainly caused by osteoblast inhibition, our results showed that the gene expressions of some osteoblasts increased after approximately one month of flight. A recent study using medaka fish showed that osteoblast marker genes are upregulated immediately after exposure to microgravity<sup><a aria-describedby="CR22" class="usa-link" href="#CR22">22</a></sup>. Therefore, the gene upregulation in our study might have occurred during the early phase of spaceflight. In contrast, <em>Bglap</em> expression was significantly downregulated under microgravity. In a previous 14-day space experiment, murine osteoblasts showed reduced expression of transcription factors and proteins involved in osteoblast differentiation<sup><a aria-describedby="CR23" class="usa-link" href="#CR23">23</a></sup>. This suggests potential negative regulation of gene expression for osteoblast differentiation during spaceflight, following an initial phase of upregulation. In summary, osteoblast-related genes may undergo distinct regulatory mechanisms contingent on the specific phase of spaceflight. Further, the expressions of osteoclast marker genes, <em>Acp5</em> and <em>Ctsk</em>, both of which are specifically expressed by osteoclasts, regulate osteoclastic bone resorption, were significantly upregulated in MG mice compared to those in GC mice, and these changes were partially suppressed in PG mice (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3</a>E). The changes in <em>Acp5</em> expression between the experimental groups were similar to those in the plasma levels of TRAP, the product of <em>Acp5</em>. Thus, the expressions of osteoblast and osteoclast markers were significantly altered in the bone under microgravity, and these changes were mostly suppressed under AG and 1/6 <em>g</em>, suggesting that the bone is highly sensitive to gravitational alterations.</p></section><section id="Sec8"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">The thymus under lunar gravity is histologically normal, although microgravity does not prevent weight loss</h3>
<p id="Par12">Following spaceflight, the thymus is known to undergo atrophy<sup><a aria-describedby="CR24" class="usa-link" href="#CR24">24</a>–<a aria-describedby="CR26" class="usa-link" href="#CR26">26</a></sup>, and findings of the MHU-1 mission also suggest that the weight of the thymus decreases in a microgravity environment, and artificial 1 <em>g</em> partially prevents this decrease<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. In MHU-1, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in AG mice was reduced to 79.8% (1GC; 1.73 ± 0.22, AG; 1.38 ± 0.14) of that in 1GC mice, and that in MG mice was reduced to 56.6% (1GC; 1.73 ± 0.22, MG; 0.98 ± 0.17) of that in 1GC mice. In contrast, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in PG mice in MHU-4 and -5 decreased to 76.4% (4GC; 1.44 ± 0.17, 4PG; 1.10 ± 0.22) and 79.2% (5GC; 1.49 ± 0.14, 5PG; 1.18 ± 0.04) of that in GC mice, respectively. This indicates that 1/6 <em>g</em> and artificial 1 <em>g</em> partially suppressed gravity-induced thymus reduction in mice (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4</a>A). Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine the cause of thymus weight loss due to housing in a 1/6 <em>g</em> environment. HE staining revealed no significant changes between PG and GC mice (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4</a>B). This confirms that no abnormalities were also observed in the thymus of MG mice by HE staining carried out in our previous study<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. In our previous study, immunostaining with anti-keratin-5 (Krt5; a marker for the medullary region) and keratin-8 (Krt-8; a marker for the cortical region) in the thymus of MHU-1 MG mice showed that Krt5-positive medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are mislocalized in the cortical region<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. In the present study, no significant changes were observed in the global structure and size of the medullary and cortical regions in PG mice (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4</a>C). Furthermore, immunostaining with anti-Aire (a transcription factor expressed in the medullary region), <em>Ulex europaeus</em> agglutinin 1 (UEA-1; a marker for mTECs), and nuclei showed no differences between PG and GC mice (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4</a>C). This result concurs with the lack of abnormality in the distribution of their expression, which we previously found to be unchanged among MG, AG, and GC mice in MHU-1<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. Thus, the abnormal distribution of thymic epithelial cells may depend on the degree of gravitational change. In summary, 1/6 <em>g</em> and artificial 1 <em>g</em> partially countered thymic weight loss and prevented histological changes induced in the microgravity environment.</p>

<p id="Par13">RNA-seq analysis was performed to determine the effects of different gravitational environments on gene expression. A total of 2880 genes with an FDR &lt; 0.05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, subsequently revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4</a>D). Horizontal clustering between mice classified them into 1 <em>g</em> group (1GC, 4GC, 5GC, and AG) and less than 1 <em>g</em> group (4PG, 5PG, and MG). Furthermore, even in the 1 <em>g</em> environment, the space experiment (AG) and GC experiments (1GC, 4GC, 5GC) were classified into different groups. This may reflect changes in the process of the space experiment and GC experiment. GO analysis further revealed that cluster 1, which was downregulated in PG and MG mice compared to that in GCs, contained genes associated with endothelial morphogenesis (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4</a>E). Consistently, altered localization of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor has been reported in human CD34+ stem cells under simulated microgravity<sup><a aria-describedby="CR27" class="usa-link" href="#CR27">27</a></sup>. Cluster 3 and 4 indicated upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice compared to those in GCs; particularly genes included in cluster 4 were only upregulated in MG mice. Clusters 3 and 4 included genes associated with cell migration. Thymic atrophy is caused by various physiological stressors, including aging and infections<sup><a aria-describedby="CR28" class="usa-link" href="#CR28">28</a>–<a aria-describedby="CR30" class="usa-link" href="#CR30">30</a></sup>. Previous studies using protozoan-infected mice have demonstrated thymic atrophy, wherein T cells migrate from the thymus to peripheral lymphoid organs<sup><a aria-describedby="CR31" class="usa-link" href="#CR31">31</a></sup>. Similarly, the effects of microgravity and 1/6 <em>g</em> may potentially induce the release of several molecular ligands that control cell migration and contribute to the establishment of thymic atrophy. Cluster 2 and 5, downregulated in MG mice, comprised genes associated with the cell cycle. RNA-seq analysis of the thymus from two independent flight experiments, MHU-1 and -2, has revealed differences in the gene expression profiles between the two missions owing to differences in flight schedules and conditions<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. Nevertheless, integrated results have shown an impact on cell cycle progression without significant signs of apoptosis enhancement in relatively long-duration spaceflight<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. Consistently, apoptosis did not influence any of the five clusters. Moreover, our results implied the influence of cell cycle-regulating genes in clusters 2 and 5. Cluster 2 is downregulated in MG, but not in PG mice, suggesting that it contributes to the suppressing thymic weight loss in 1/6 <em>g</em>. Cluster 5 showed different gene expression profiles between 4 and 5PG mice because centrifuges with different radii might affect the gravity gradient in the cage. Interestingly, the cell cycle may be affected by slight changes in gravity. Changes in gene expression in the mouse thymus due to hypergravity are inhibited by a surgical lesion in the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear<sup><a aria-describedby="CR32" class="usa-link" href="#CR32">32</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par14">The simultaneous exposure of human fibroblasts to simulated microgravity and radiation exhibits more pronounced effects on the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes than those with radiation exposure alone<sup><a aria-describedby="CR33" class="usa-link" href="#CR33">33</a></sup>. Hence, our results demonstrated the effect of gravity on the cell cycle in the space experiment by comparing the PG and MG mice. Additionally, osteosarcoma tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs have been reported during hindlimb unloading<sup><a aria-describedby="CR34" class="usa-link" href="#CR34">34</a></sup>. Therefore, it is critical to determine the cancer risk associated with changes in gravity. Future studies using other gravity loads will clarify the risks of thymus atrophy and carcinogenesis during spaceflight.</p>
<p id="Par15">Our previous study implied that artificial 1 <em>g</em> can alleviate thymic atrophy during spaceflight despite AG mice experiencing slightly lower gravity than that of GC mice owing to the relatively small radius of cage rotation<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. In this study, we showed that 1/6 <em>g</em> could alleviate thymic weight loss, similar to AG. However, gene expression profiles in PG mice were different from those in AG mice, which suggests that 1/6 <em>g</em> is still insufficient to attenuate all changes during spaceflight. Future studies using MARS are warranted to identify a gravity threshold that can prevent gene expression changes in space.</p>
<p id="Par16">In summary, the effects of both the space experimental procedure and low gravity on thymus atrophy may be involved, which is consistent with the clustering patterns of exhaustive gene expression.</p></section><section id="Sec10"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">The effect of microgravity in the spleen was alleviated in lunar gravity</h3>

To elucidate the effect of 1/6 <em>g</em> on secondary lymphoid organs, we analyzed the histological and gene expression changes in the spleen.

A total of 94 genes (FDR &lt; 0.05) between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig5">5</a>D). These genes were also classified by horizontal clustering into mice experiencing spaceflight (5PG, MG, and AG) and mice in the ground control (1GC, 4GC, and 5GC), indicating that the general gene expression changes in the spleen were caused by the space environment and experimental processes rather than by gravity changes. Although difficult to comprehend, data from 4PG mice were dispersed in both these groups. Based on the results of horizontal clustering, the relevant factors of the space experiment, such as radiation or stress, may have largely affected gene expression profiles in the spleen. Therefore, we further compared gene expressions among 4PG, 5PG, MG, and AG mice to elucidate the effects of different gravitational loads. A total of 167 genes with an FDR &lt; 0.05 between MG and AG mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing three distinct clusters (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig5">5</a>E). Horizontal clustering classified them into 1 <em>g</em> (AG) and less than 1 <em>g</em> (4PG, 5PG, and MG) groups, indicating that PG mice showed gene expression patterns similar to those of MG mice. GO analysis also suggested that cluster 2, with upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice, included genes associated with the inflammatory response (Supplementary Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#MOESM2">2</a>). In cluster 3, upregulation was observed only in MG mice, suggesting that 1/6 <em>g</em> could partially alleviate the gene expression changes in microgravity.</p>
<p id="Par19">We further compared the expression of erythrocyte-related genes in the spleen. Erythrocyte-related genes, regulated by <em>Gata1</em> and <em>Tal1</em>, are downregulated due to the combined effect of space environments<sup><a aria-describedby="CR13" class="usa-link" href="#CR13">13</a></sup>. Moreover, experiments in <em>Nrf2</em> (NF-E2-related factor-2) knockout mice suggest that these changes are not induced by flight-related stress but by other space-specific factors<sup><a aria-describedby="CR36" class="usa-link" href="#CR36">36</a></sup>. To elucidate the effect of different gravitational forces on erythroid genes, we compared the expression of 19 genes regulated by <em>Gata1</em> and <em>Tal1</em> (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig5">5</a>F). All genes were downregulated in MG and both PG mice, but these reductions were partially alleviated in AG mice. Furthermore, we compared the expression levels of <em>Alas2, Slc4a1, Hba-a2,</em> and <em>Rhag</em>, which are known to regress after spaceflight regardless of Nrf2 expression<sup><a aria-describedby="CR36" class="usa-link" href="#CR36">36</a></sup> (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig5">5</a>G). The expression levels of <em>Alas2, Slc4a1,</em> and <em>Hba-a2</em> were significantly lower in MG mice than those in GC mice. Moreover, these changes were not observed in either AG or PG mice. Consequently, gravity loading may partially rescue the downregulation of these erythropoiesis-related genes. This observation aligns with the hypothesis that weightlessness contributes to anemia during spaceflight<sup><a aria-describedby="CR37" class="usa-link" href="#CR37">37</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="Par20">Although we have uncovered novel facts that can only be elucidated through space experiments, our study has several limitations. First, because our space experiments only used mice, it is unclear whether our findings can be applied to human biology. Another limitation is that the tissue samples were collected on the second day after the mice returned to Earth. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that our data, especially the RNA-seq data, were altered by the effects of exposure to the 1 <em>g</em> environment. Although space experiments must address various issues to be implemented, this study will serve as a resource for future research.</p>
<p id="Par21">In conclusion, using MARS, we evaluated the effects of microgravity and 1/6 <em>g</em> in the bone, thymus, and spleen. In the bone and thymus, morphological and gene expression changes induced in microgravity were not completely alleviated in 1/6 <em>g</em>. In contrast, the gravitational threshold for the spleen exited around 1/6 <em>g</em><em>,</em> considering the preserved splenic weight and structure. Thus, responsiveness to gravity, phenotypic abnormalities, and gene expression patterns varied in each organ. In addition, two different centrifuges were used to generate 1/6 <em>g</em> in MHU-4 and -5, with different centrifuge radii, resulting in different speeds and gravity loads to the cephalic position. Although differences were observed between the MHU-4 and -5 missions in the righting reflex test, the marginal differences in RNA-seq findings for the thymus and spleen were negligible compared with those in other gravity conditions.</p>
<p id="Par22">This research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms and further evaluating the gravitational threshold for each organ may offer strategies to maintain skeletal structure and immune systems in future space exploration.</p></section></section><section id="Sec11"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Methods</h2>

JAXA later received the TCU from NASA and transported it to Explora Biolabs in San Diego for further analysis. The health conditions of the mice were checked and their body weights were measured. Subsequently, the mid-air righting reflex test was performed. Each mouse oriented in the supine position was dropped twice from a height of approximately 40 cm above the padded surface, and the average time for righting was analyzed using high-speed video (DSC-RX100M5, SONY, Tokyo, Japan). The rotarod performance test was performed after the righting reflex test. First, the mouse was placed on a rod rotating at a speed of 2 rpm to acclimate it, and the experiment began when the mouse was able to stay on the rod (47600, Bioresearch Center, Nagoya, Japan). The rotation speed of the rod was accelerated from 2 to 40 rpm in 2 min using a ramping acceleration mode. The time each mouse could stay on the rod was measured.

Reconstructed three-dimensional microstructural image data were analyzed and all parameters were calculated according to previously published guidelines<sup><a aria-describedby="CR38" class="usa-link" href="#CR38">38</a></sup> using TRI/3D-BON software (RATOC System Engineering, Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, parameters of trabecular tissue volume (TV, mm<sup>3</sup>), trabecular bone volume (BV, mm<sup>3</sup>), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th, µm), trabecular bone number (Tb.N, /mm), trabecular bone separation (Tb.Sp, µm; intervals among trabecular bones), average thickness of cortical bone (Ct.Th, µm), and cross-sectional area of cortical bone (Ct.Ar, mm<sup>2</sup>) were measured directly based on the computed tomography images. A percentage of the trabecular bone volume for the total tissue volume was calculated as BV/TV (%). Bone mineral content in the trabecular bone tissue (BMC/TV, mg/cm<sup>3</sup>) and bone mineral density in the cortical bone (BMD, mg/cm<sup>3</sup>) were measured with a bone mineral quantification phantom.</p></section><section id="Sec16"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Measurement of plasma TRAP and osteocalcin</h3>

<p id="Par35">Total RNA was extracted from bone, spleen, and thymus using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The RNA-seq library was prepared from 50 ng RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) after rRNA depletion (NEB NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 36 bases) was performed using NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequence reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using CLC Genomics Workbench (Version 10.1.1; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Gene expression levels were calculated as the total read count normalized to transcripts per million. Genes with 0 counts in all samples and genes with total lead counts of 5 or less were excluded. Differential expression was analyzed using the Empirical Analysis of DGE tool (edgeR)<sup><a aria-describedby="CR39" class="usa-link" href="#CR39">39</a></sup> in the CLC Main Workbench (CLC MW, Version 21.0.3; Qiagen).
