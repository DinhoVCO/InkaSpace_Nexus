<p>High levels of methylesterification of pectin allow for enhanced cell expansion, partitioning of resources to leaf growth, and increased leaf area for photosynthesis, which in turn enhance plant growth.</p></section><section class="abstract" id="abstract2"><h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were varied through manipulation of <em>cotton Golgi-related</em> (<em>CGR</em>) <em>2</em> or <em>3</em> genes encoding two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases. Increased levels of methylesterification in a line over-expressing <em>CGR2</em> (CGR2OX) resulted in highly expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced methylesterification in a mutant lacking both <em>CGR</em>-genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion to chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the <em>CGR</em>-mutants can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based photosynthesis. Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; however, <em>CGR</em>-mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area.</p></section><hr class="headless"/>
<p>Photosynthesis is the major source of carbon (C) for plant growth. However, there is no clear correlation between area-based photosynthesis and plant growth, and studies have shown that the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area growth parameters. A strong positive correlation exists between relative growth rate and leaf growth parameters such as leaf area per unit leaf mass (specific leaf area, <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a>), leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio), and investment of C in leaf growth (leaf mass ratio; <a aria-describedby="bib22" class="usa-link" href="#bib22">Shipley, 2002</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib21" class="usa-link" href="#bib21">Poorter et al., 2009</a>). In fact, modeled partitioning coefficients obtained from the Arabidopsis leaf area growth model showed that plant growth is more sensitive to changes in C partitioning to leaf thickening and leaf area growth than to changes to area-based photosynthesis (<a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al., 2015</a>). The term “thickening” was used to indicate increased mass per unit leaf area (<a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>), whether that results from increased thickness in the normal sense of more depth to the leaf between adaxial and abaxial surfaces or from increased cell density. <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> is the reciprocal of <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a>. While <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> has been shown to positively and linearly correlate with investment to leaves in the form of anatomical and chemical composition changes, <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a> shows a hyperbolic relationship with such changes (<a aria-describedby="bib21" class="usa-link" href="#bib21">Poorter et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, we will mainly focus on <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> throughout this work. <a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al. (2015)</a> concluded that even though photosynthetic C is required for growth, the degree of growth is determined by the amount of C partitioned to leaf area growth and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (<a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al., 2015</a>). However, how and to what degree this variation in leaf expansion and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> is affected by cell wall properties of leaf mesophyll cells is not known. In addition, the underlying mechanisms that drive C partitioning to favor either leaf area growth or <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, and the genes that can influence changes in C demands toward these two processes, are yet to be found.</p>
<p>Leaves are the major photosynthetic organs in plants and regulation of cell expansion and growth is crucial for the development of leaf architecture. Leaf growth can occur in the form of leaf area or <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (<a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al., 2015</a>). The size and shape of cells in the leaf mesophyll can have a significant impact on: (1) projected or effective leaf surface area, which is the leaf area capable of intercepting light; (2) leaf mass per unit leaf area or <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>; (3) CO<sub>2</sub> conductance from the external environment through intercellular air spaces into chloroplasts in mesophyll cells; and (4) surface area of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspaces (<a aria-describedby="bib10" class="usa-link" href="#bib10">Honda and Fisher, 1978</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib5" class="usa-link" href="#bib5">Evans et al., 1994</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib8" class="usa-link" href="#bib8">Galmés et al., 2013</a>). The plant cell wall controls expansion and positioning of cells of photosynthetic tissues and therefore, changes in cell wall properties will have a direct impact on the above properties. Although there is evidence for changes in leaf architecture as a result of alterations in genes that affect the synthesis and properties of the cell wall (<a aria-describedby="bib2" class="usa-link" href="#bib2">Burton et al., 2000</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib11" class="usa-link" href="#bib11">Kim and Delaney, 2002</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib20" class="usa-link" href="#bib20">Pilling et al., 2004</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib29" class="usa-link" href="#bib29">Wolf et al., 2009</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>), an in-depth analysis of effects on leaf gas exchange and overall plant growth under such circumstances has not yet been conducted.</p>
<p>The plant cell wall is composed mainly of polysaccharides, and among these, pectin is considered a critical element that controls cell wall elasticity and expansion. Pectin is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and secreted in a highly methylesterified form. Methylesterification of galacturonic acid (GalUA) is catalyzed by pectin methyltransferases (<a aria-describedby="bib29" class="usa-link" href="#bib29">Wolf et al., 2009</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>). The level of pectin methylesterification in the cell wall is controlled by methylesterases and inhibitors of methylesterases, which modify the levels of methylation and demethylation of GalUA in the pectin backbone (<a aria-describedby="bib29" class="usa-link" href="#bib29">Wolf et al., 2009</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>). Removal of methyl groups by methylesterases allows carboxyl groups of GalUA to form Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-mediated intermolecular linkages that lead to hardening of pectin (<a aria-describedby="bib2" class="usa-link" href="#bib2">Burton et al., 2000</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib9" class="usa-link" href="#bib9">Heldt and Piechulla, 2010</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, over-expression of pectin methylesterase inhibitors results in longer root cells (<a aria-describedby="bib14" class="usa-link" href="#bib14">Lionetti et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, the degree of methylation and demethylation of pectin determines the delicate balance between cell wall extensibility and rigidity with consequent effects on growth and shape of cells (<a aria-describedby="bib2" class="usa-link" href="#bib2">Burton et al., 2000</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib20" class="usa-link" href="#bib20">Pilling et al., 2004</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib14" class="usa-link" href="#bib14">Lionetti et al., 2007</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib29" class="usa-link" href="#bib29">Wolf et al., 2009</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib30" class="usa-link" href="#bib30">Xiao and Anderson, 2013</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with this notion, over-expression of pectin methyltransferases, <em>CGR2</em> or <em>CGR3</em>, led to enhanced rosette size and fresh weight in Arabidopsis (<a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>). However, a double knockout of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> genes, named <em>cgr2/3</em>, showed reduced cell expansion and overall plant growth; both phenotypes correlated with reduced levels of pectin methylesterification compared to wild type (<a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>). To our knowledge, the effect of pectin methylation on leaf growth parameters, photosynthesis, and respiration through its effect on leaf architecture has not been studied.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to use the Arabidopsis model system developed by <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al. (2015)</a> with altered levels of pectin methyltransferases, <em>CGR2</em> or <em>CGR3</em> (single gene modifiers found to positively or negatively affect cell expansion as a function of their cellular availability) to investigate how changes in cell-wall plasticity affect C assimilation, leaf respiration, and overall plant growth through effects on leaf area growth and mesophyll structure. We examined whether the changes in overall plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> could result from changes in leaf area growth and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> or changes in area-based photosynthesis to explore the relationship between photosynthesis and growth. Based on the differences in rosette size reported previously (<a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>), we hypothesized that area-based photosynthesis rates would be lower in a <em>CGR2</em> over-expressor (CGR2OX) but larger in the mutant lacking both <em>CGR2</em> and <em>3</em> genes (<em>cgr2/3</em>). As <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> affect pectin methylation and cell expansion in leaves, we also hypothesized that plant growth would be enhanced in the CGR2OX line and reduced in the <em>cgr2/3</em> mutant mainly as a result of altered <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. Indeed, through analysis of leaf and plant growth, gas exchange, and growth modeling, we found that <em>CGR</em>2 and <em>CGR</em>3 have significant impacts on photosynthesis and respiration through alteration of mesophyll structure and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. Plant growth was enhanced in the CGR2OX line but reduced in the <em>cgr2/3</em> mutant. This variation in plant growth was as a result of differences in C partitioning and not as a result of changes in photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area. These observations support a novel (to our knowledge) model that changes in cell wall plasticity due to changes in pectin composition influence C partitioning between leaf area growth and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, thereby regulating the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth.</p>

<p>Cell wall composition of Col-0 (wild type), <em>cgr2/3</em> complemented with <em>CGR2</em> (cgr2com), CGR2OX, and <em>cgr2/3</em> was analyzed to determine whether the previously observed changes in methylesterification and modification of cell wall polysaccharides by <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al. (2015)</a> were retained in the mutant lines. Similar to what was seen by <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al. (2015)</a>, crystalline cellulose content was lower in <em>cgr2/3</em> mutant line and it was greater in CGR2OX than that in Col-0 (<a class="usa-link usa-link--external" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.16.00173/DC1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supplemental Fig. S1A</a>). In addition, the content of neutral sugars such as fucose, arabinose, and glucose was significantly higher in <em>cgr2/3</em> than Col-0, as was shown by <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al.

These data support that the cell wall composition, including pectin and the degree of methylesterification, is altered in the CGR2OX and <em>cgr2/3</em> mutant lines in response to altered <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> gene expression, as previously reported in <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al.

CGR2OX had larger palisade cells and 3 to 4 mesophyll cell layers compared to Col-0, which produced 4 to 5 layers of comparatively smaller palisade cells (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig2">Fig. 2A</a>). However, the mesophyll cells of <em>cgr2/3</em> were significantly smaller and more numerous than in Col-0 (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig2">Fig. 2A</a>), which led to a marked reduction in intercellular airspaces in the leaf mesophyll (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig2">Fig. 2C</a>). Consequently, a significant negative correlation was observed between the number of cells and intercellular air spaces in the leaf mesophyll (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig2">Fig. 2C</a>). Enhanced cell density and the reduction in intercellular air spaces in <em>cgr2/3</em> compared to the other Arabidopsis lines also led to a significant reduction in mesophyll cell surface area (<em>S</em><sub>mes</sub>) and chloroplast surface area (<em>S</em><sub>c</sub>) exposed to intercellular air spaces per unit leaf area (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig2">Fig. 2, D and E</a>).</p>
<p>Interestingly also, the number of chloroplasts per unit area of a leaf cross section was lower in CGR2OX and greater in <em>cgr2/3</em> compared to Col-0 (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig3">Fig. 3A</a>). However, the average size of chloroplasts was smaller in all transgenic lines compared to Col-0 (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig3">Fig. 3B</a>). The data indicate that the reduction in <em>S</em><sub>c</sub> in <em>cgr2/3</em> was not a result of a reduction in chloroplast area per unit leaf area, but instead was linked to the significant reduction in intercellular air spaces in the leaf mesophyll. Therefore, our results show that variations in the levels of methylesterification of the cell wall significantly impact leaf thickness, cell density, and mesophyll architecture.</p>

Thus, photosynthesis/respiration ratio remained significantly smaller in <em>cgr2/3</em> throughout the lifecycle (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig5">Fig. 5A</a>). Although not statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level, CGR2OX showed a trend toward lower area-based respiration (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig4">Fig. 4B</a>) and therefore, its photosynthesis/respiration ratio appeared to be greater in young rosette leaves at 29 <a class="usa-link" href="#def1">DAS</a> (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig5">Fig. 5A</a>). Increased area-based respiration in <em>cgr2/3</em> and lower area-based respiration in CGR2OX correlated well with the differences in the number of mesophyll cells in these lines (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig2">Fig. 2C</a>). In general, plant-based photosynthesis in CGR2OX was similar to Col-0 with an upward trend, even though area-based photosynthesis was smaller (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig4">Fig. 4, A and C</a>); this was mainly due to the larger projected leaf area in CGR2OX (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig1">Fig. 1A</a>). However, owing to its smaller projected leaf area, plant-based photosynthesis in <em>cgr2/3</em> was much lower than Col-0 (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig4">Fig. 4C</a>). Plant-based respiration was greater in CGR2OX, and smaller in <em>cgr2/3</em> than in Col-0 (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig4">Fig. 4D</a>), which could be explained by differences in total leaf area (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig1">Fig. 1B</a>).</p>

The decrease in C gain in <em>cgr2/3</em> resulted from reduced plant-based photosynthesis due to the smaller projected leaf area and smaller photosynthesis/respiration ratio compared to CGR2OX (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig1">Figs. 1A</a>, <a class="usa-link" href="#fig4">4C</a>, and <a class="usa-link" href="#fig5">5A</a><strong>)</strong>.

<p>The differences in chloroplast number and size could not account for the large differences observed in area-based photosynthesis between <em>cgr2/3</em> and the other three Arabidopsis lines (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</a>). Therefore, to investigate whether lower area-based photosynthesis rates in <em>cgr2/3</em> at harvests 2, 3, and 4 were a result of a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> availability owing to altered mesophyll architecture, the degree of <sup>13</sup>C discrimination was analyzed in leaf tissue of the four Arabidopsis lines. The <sup>13</sup>C content of <em>cgr2/3</em> was greater, consistent with less discrimination against <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> during photosynthesis compared to the other lines (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig6">Fig. 6, A–C</a>). The average CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure at Rubisco calculated using the δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>VPDB</sub> (Vienna-Pee-Dee Belemnite, <a class="usa-link" href="#def6">VPDB</a>) values showed CO<sub>2</sub> availability to be significantly lower in <em>cgr2/3</em> (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig6">Fig. 6, D–F</a>). These data are in agreement with the hypothesis that there is a greater resistance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into chloroplasts of <em>cgr2/3</em>, owing to lower surface areas of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts facing intercellular air spaces per unit leaf area as a result of enhanced cell density and reduced intercellular air spaces (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig2">Fig. 2, C–E</a>). Therefore, reduction in <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> availability appears to have a strong negative impact on area-based photosynthesis owing to reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> availability to chloroplasts, most likely as a result of altered mesophyll architecture.</p>

<p>The Arabidopsis leaf area growth model parameterized with measurements obtained from the four Arabidopsis lines was used to estimate how much C was partitioned to new leaf area growth and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, as a proportion of net assimilated C that is available for growth. These values, referred to as partitioning coefficients (<a class="usa-link" href="#tblI">Table I</a>), would allow determination of whether changes in <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> availability could affect C partitioning to growth or respiratory processes. The proportions of C partitioned to leaf growth in total (C partitioned to area + <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>), and to root growth found by <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> feeding experiments at 29 <a class="usa-link" href="#def1">DAS</a>, were used as an initial estimate when setting the partitioning coefficients to leaf growth for the early vegetative growth phase (<a class="usa-link usa-link--external" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/pp.16.00173/DC1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Supplemental Fig. S4</a>; <a class="usa-link" href="#tblI">Table I</a>).

<p>In this study, we investigated how modification of cell wall plasticity via the genetic manipulation of pectin methyltransferases, <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em>, affects C assimilation, leaf respiration, and overall plant growth through effects on leaf area growth and mesophyll structure. We also wanted to further understand the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth by determining whether the changes in overall plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered cellular availability of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> were a result of changes in growth in terms of leaf area and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> or due to changes in area-based photosynthesis. We found that over-expression of <em>CGR2</em> had a significant positive effect on leaf area and plant growth. On the other hand, suppression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> expression caused a marked increase in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> and a reduction in leaf area and plant growth. Altered expression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> also had a significant impact on photosynthesis and respiration through altered mesophyll architecture. The differences in plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> levels were linked to changes in C partitioning to leaf area growth and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> rather than altered area-based photosynthesis rates. These findings establish that <em>CGR2</em>- and <em>CGR3</em>-mediated pectin methylesterification affects mesophyll architecture, C accumulation, C partitioning, leaf and plant growth, and the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth.</p>

<em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> Directly Affect Leaf Mass per Unit Area by Altering Both Leaf Thickness and the Mass of Leaf per Unit Volume of Leaf Tissue</h3>
<p>Often, thicker leaves are associated with larger <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> due to an increase in the number of cell layers, which can increase leaf mass per unit leaf area (<a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib21" class="usa-link" href="#bib21">Poorter et al., 2009</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib26" class="usa-link" href="#bib26">Villar et al., 2013</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al., 2015</a>). However, a negative correlation exists between leaf mass density or <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> (mass of leaf per unit volume of leaf tissue) and leaf thickness, and both parameters can affect <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> as follows: <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> (kg m<sup>−3</sup>) = leaf mass/(leaf area × leaf thickness) and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (kg m<sup>−2</sup>) = <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> × leaf thickness (<a aria-describedby="bib28" class="usa-link" href="#bib28">Witkowski and Lamont, 1991</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib21" class="usa-link" href="#bib21">Poorter et al., 2009</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib26" class="usa-link" href="#bib26">Villar et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, leaf thickening or an increase in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> can occur due to an increase in leaf thickness or <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a>. While thicker leaves have been shown to be associated with larger mesophyll cells (elongated, especially in the depth direction) and larger air spaces, <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> has been associated with smaller proportions of intercellular air spaces and smaller cells (<a aria-describedby="bib25" class="usa-link" href="#bib25">Tsuge et al., 1996</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib21" class="usa-link" href="#bib21">Poorter et al., 2009</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib26" class="usa-link" href="#bib26">Villar et al., 2013</a>). In addition to being affected by anatomical changes, <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> and <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> can also be determined by variations in cellular and chemical composition (<a aria-describedby="bib4" class="usa-link" href="#bib4">Cunningham et al., 1999</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>). For example, plants with slow growth rates possess a larger number of smaller cells with thicker cell walls, and a greater proportion of lignin and other cell wall polysaccharides per unit leaf area that can increase <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (<a aria-describedby="bib4" class="usa-link" href="#bib4">Cunningham et al., 1999</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>). A key aspect of cellular mass is represented by organelles, and plants with higher growth rates may possess large cells with a lower number of chloroplasts, which results in lower <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (<a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, while both CGR2OX and <em>cgr2/3</em> had thinner leaves compared to Col-0, <em>cgr2/3</em> showed a significant increase in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. Such increase in <em>cgr2/3</em> can be attributed to increased <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> as a result of enhanced cell density and reduction of intercellular air spaces in the leaf mesophyll. Smaller cells can lead to concentration of cellular metabolites, which can also lead to increased <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a>. In addition, <em>cgr2/3</em> also possessed a larger number of chloroplasts per unit leaf area. The proportions of cell wall components per unit leaf area are also likely greater in <em>cgr2/3</em> compared to the other backgrounds. Therefore, collectively the data clearly show that although <em>cgr2/3</em> had thinner leaves, enhanced <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> led to greater leaf mass per unit area (or lower <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a>) in <em>cgr2/3</em>. Conversely, <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> in CGR2OX was significantly smaller than <em>cgr2/3</em>. Leaves of CGR2OX were also thicker than <em>cgr2/3</em> and contained larger intercellular airspaces, and larger cells with a lower number of chloroplasts. Therefore, our results support that variation in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> between CGR2OX and <em>cgr2/3</em> resulted from the combination of increased leaf thickness and reduced leaf mass density.</p>
<p>The significant alterations in mesophyll architecture observed during this study are linked to changes in <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> expression. Based on the model that reduced methylation of pectin may enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated cross linking of GalUA in cell walls, thereby preventing normal cell expansion in <em>cgr2/3</em> (<a aria-describedby="bib2" class="usa-link" href="#bib2">Burton et al., 2000</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib29" class="usa-link" href="#bib29">Wolf et al., 2009</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>), we propose that the larger number of smaller mesophyll cells observed in <em>cgr2/3</em> during this study is likely linked to the hardening of the cell wall and consequent restriction of cell wall expansion. This in turn is likely to cause an increase of the cell number per unit leaf area in <em>cgr2/3</em> compared to Col-0. In addition, cross linking between GalUA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cell wall pectin is required for cellular adhesion (<a aria-describedby="bib3" class="usa-link" href="#bib3">Caffall and Mohnen, 2009</a>). Also a reduction in GalUA-Ca<sup>2+</sup> complex formation in <em>Solanum lycopersicum</em> resulted in large air spaces in the fruit pericarp caused by dramatic reductions in the middle-lamellae-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion (<a aria-describedby="bib3" class="usa-link" href="#bib3">Caffall and Mohnen, 2009</a>). The observed decrease in air spaces in <em>cgr2/3</em> and the dense distribution of the cells (hence thinner leaves) are likely due to enhanced cell-to-cell adhesion because of the lower degree of methylesterified pectin in <em>cgr2/3</em> compared to Col-0. In contrast, enhanced methylation of pectin promotes cell expansion (<a aria-describedby="bib12" class="usa-link" href="#bib12">Kim et al., 2015</a>); this resulted in the observed presence of wider palisade cells and a lower number of cell layers (hence thinner leaves) in CGR2OX than Col-0. The number of cells and area of airspaces in CGR2OX differed only marginally from Col-0. However, CGR2OX did have a smaller number of smaller chloroplasts compared to Col-0, which may be an indication of lower <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. Whether over-expression of <em>CGR2</em> has a dosage effect, and over-expression of both <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> would result in larger and thicker leaves with lower cell density remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Thinner leaves usually correlate with larger <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a> or smaller <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (<a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al., 2015</a>). However, based on the negative correlation between <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> and leaf thickness, it is likely that <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> would start to increase should leaf thickness decrease below a certain optimum, thereby resulting in an increase in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. This was demonstrated in <em>cgr2/3</em>, where suppression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> resulted in leaves that were too thin, leading to higher cell density and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. This can have significant negative effects on leaf gas exchange properties and daily C gain, as discussed below. The above phenotype was rescued by complementing with <em>CGR2</em>, as seen in cgr2com or by over-expressing <em>CGR2</em> as in CGR2OX. Thus, the degree of <em>CGR2</em>- and <em>CGR3</em>-mediated pectin methyl esterification can directly affect <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> by altering both leaf thickness and leaf mass density.</p></section><section id="s12"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">
<em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> Affect Area-Based Respiration and Daily C Gain by Altering <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a> and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>
</h3>
<p>In general, leaves growing under high light develop thicker leaves with multiple cell layers and higher <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (lower <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a>), and incurs higher area-based respiration rates corresponding to their greater mass per unit leaf area (<a aria-describedby="bib17" class="usa-link" href="#bib17">Mitchell et al., 1999</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, plants grown under low light have lower <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (higher <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a>), which optimizes light capture and lowers area-based respiration rates (<a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>). This assists in maximizing daily C gain and compensates for lower area-based photosynthesis rates when growing under low light conditions (<a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>). Although <em>cgr2/3</em> produced thinner leaves, the marked enhancement in area-based respiration positively correlated with enhanced leaf cell density and higher <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. Higher area-based respiratory rates led to smaller photosynthesis/respiration ratio, and when coupled with smaller projected leaf area, they had a significant negative impact on daily carbon gain. Thus, pectin methylesterification affects area-based respiration rates through alterations in leaf cell density, <a class="usa-link" href="#def4">LMD</a>, and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> and consequently affect photosynthetic efficiency in plants.</p></section><section id="s13"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">
<em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> Directly Affect Area-Based Photosynthesis by Altering Mesophyll Architecture</h3>
<p>Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> into chloroplasts occurs along the path that poses the least resistance through the cell wall, plasma membrane, chloroplast envelope, and into the chloroplast stroma (<a aria-describedby="bib23" class="usa-link" href="#bib23">Terashima et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, <em>S</em><sub>c</sub> represents the active area through which CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses in to the chloroplast stroma (<a aria-describedby="bib23" class="usa-link" href="#bib23">Terashima et al., 2006</a>). A decrease in <em>S</em><sub>c</sub> leads to a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at Rubisco and therefore to a reduction in the carboxylation/oxygenation ratio (<a aria-describedby="bib23" class="usa-link" href="#bib23">Terashima et al., 2006</a>). Parameters that affect CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into the chloroplast stroma are thickness of the mesophyll cell wall, internal conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion, and stomatal conductance (<a aria-describedby="bib23" class="usa-link" href="#bib23">Terashima et al., 2006</a>). <em>S</em><sub>c</sub> has been shown to be positively correlated with internal conductance, while the latter is negatively correlated with cell wall thickness (<a aria-describedby="bib23" class="usa-link" href="#bib23">Terashima et al., 2006</a>).</p>
<p>In contrast to our original hypothesis, area-based photosynthesis rates were significantly lower in <em>cgr2/3</em> for most of the lifecycle, even though this mutant possessed smaller projected leaf area and denser leaves. This study revealed that this reduction in area-based photosynthesis in <em>cgr2/3</em> was not a result of differences in chloroplast number and size, but, mainly a result of a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure at Rubisco due to restrictions imposed on CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion by increased cell density and reduced airspaces in the leaf mesophyll that lowered <em>S</em><sub>c</sub>. Preliminary investigations revealed that stomatal conductance is not negatively impacted in the mutant lines examined during this study (data not shown). Therefore, the observed reduction in area-based photosynthetic rates is most probably due to a cumulative effect of lower <em>S</em><sub>c</sub>, higher internal resistance and greater cell wall thickness per unit area. The greater area-based photosynthesis rates in <em>cgr2/3</em> observed during early stages of vegetative development may have been a result of leaves and cell walls being comparatively thinner in young plants. <em>S</em><sub>c</sub> values and CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure at Rubisco in <em>cgr2/3</em> were restored to the levels of Col-0 in cgr2com owing to alterations brought about by <em>CGR2</em> expression in its leaf anatomy: thicker leaves with less dense mesophyll and more intercellular air spaces. <em>S</em><sub>c</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure in CGR2OX were similar to that of Col-0. The lower area-based photosynthesis in CGR2OX may have resulted from thinner but larger leaves, which may have then resulted in less photosynthetic machinery per unit leaf area. Correspondingly, chloroplast number and size were lower in CGR2OX. These data emphasize the importance of pectin methylesterification in fine-tuning cell expansion and size and cell-to-cell adhesion qualities in building a leaf mesophyll optimized for CO<sub>2</sub> exchange. While thin leaves are associated with lower <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> (or enhanced <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a>), it is important to maintain an optimum thickness to maintain sufficient intercellular air spaces, which would maintain high internal conductance, <em>S</em><sub>mes</sub>, and <em>S</em><sub>c</sub>, and therefore higher carboxylation rates.</p></section><section id="s14"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Pectin Methylesterification Mediates the Relationship between Photosynthesis and Plant Growth through Alterations in C Partitioning to Leaf Area Growth and Thickening</h3>
<p>As hypothesized, suppression of <em>CGR2</em>- and <em>CGR3</em>-mediated pectin methylesterification had a profound negative effect on leaf area growth while over-expression of <em>CGR2</em> significantly enhanced leaf area growth. Suppression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> also led to a reduction in plant dry weight. Over-expression of <em>CGR2</em> enhanced plant dry weight. Growth modeling revealed that the observed variations in growth were not caused by changes in area-based photosynthesis. In fact, high rates of area-based photosynthesis measured in <em>cgr2/3</em> during early growth were found to be sufficient to drive growth higher than that seen in Col-0. Thus, growth had the opposite trend (CGROX &gt; Col-0 &gt; <em>cgr2/3</em>) compared with area-based photosynthetic rate (<em>cgr2/3</em> &gt; Col-0 &gt; CGROX). To account for enhanced overall plant growth, the amount of net assimilated C available for growth has to increase, which will depend on the total amount of C assimilated and the amount of C respired to support maintenance processes (<a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al., 2015</a>). Our study showed that <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em>, through pectin methylesterification, are capable of affecting total C assimilation by directly altering leaf area growth and by altering maintenance respiratory costs through direct effects on LMA. We also showed that although <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> affect area-based photosynthetic rates, the latter is not a major factor affecting overall plant growth.</p>
<p>A reduction in pectin methylesterification by reduced expression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> seems to enhance cell-wall hardening and cell-to-cell adhesion through increased cross linking between GalUA and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, favoring an increase in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> against cell expansion and posing a greater demand for C for <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> growth compared to area growth (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig12">Fig. 12A</a>). Hence less C will be utilized in area growth of new leaves and more C will be utilized in increasing <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, leading to a smaller projected leaf area (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig12">Fig. 12A</a>). Smaller projected leaf area yields lower whole plant C assimilation. In contrast, an increase in pectin methylesterification via enhanced expression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> seems to reduce cell wall hardening and cell-to-cell adhesion, and thereby favors cell expansion and area growth against increases in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>; it poses a greater demand for C for leaf area growth compared to that for <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> growth (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig12">Fig. 12B</a>). Hence, more C will be utilized in area growth of new leaves, and a lower proportion C will be utilized in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> growth, leading to larger projected leaf area and enhanced whole-plant C assimilation (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig12">Fig. 12B</a>). Suppression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> increases respiratory costs through higher <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, resulting in lower photosynthesis/respiration ratio, lower daily C gain, reduced net assimilated C available for growth, and ultimately reduced plant growth (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig12">Fig. 12A</a>); over-expression of <em>CGR2</em> yields opposite physiological effects (<a class="usa-link" href="#fig12">Fig. 12B</a>).</p>

<figcaption><p><em>CGR2</em>- and <em>CGR3</em>-mediated pectin methylesterification regulates the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth. A schematic diagram outlining how (A) suppression or (B) over-expression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> gene expression affects the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth in Arabidopsis is presented. Suppression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> reduces the degree of pectin methylation, which leads to an increase in cell-to-cell adhesion, cation-mediated cross linking of GalUA, and consequent hardening of cell walls. <em>CGR2</em> over-expression increases the degree of pectin methylation, which allows cell expansion through reduced cell-to-cell adhesion and cation-mediated cross linking. We propose that pectin methyltransferase enzyme, through its ability to directly alter cell expansion, determines the amount of C partitioned to leaf area growth versus growth in terms of <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. For example, while more C is partitioned to growth in terms of <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> in the <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> double knockout mutant, in the <em>CGR2</em> over-expression line more C is partitioned to leaf area growth. An increase in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> leads to enhanced area-based respiration and a reduction in leaf area contribute to a reduction in whole plant photosynthesis. Collectively, this results in a reduction in C available for growth and consequently a decrease in overall plant growth; an opposite trend is seen in CGR2OX. Thus, <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em>, through their ability to alter the degree of methylated pectin in the cell wall of the mesophyll cells, determine how photosynthate is utilized to grow the plant. In other words, <em>CGR2</em>- and <em>CGR3</em>-mediated pectin methylesterification affects the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth by regulating the proportions of C that is partitioned to leaf area growth and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. Final overall growth mainly depends on the expression patterns of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> and how much C is partitioned to area growth and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> and not on area-based photosynthesis. PME: pectin methylesterase; PMEI: PME inhibitor; PMT: pectin methyltransferase. CH<sub>3</sub>OH is methanol.</p></figcaption></figure><p>There may be other genes that also impact partitioning of carbon toward leaf area growth or <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>. One example is the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (<em>XTH</em>) gene family. Reduced expression of <em>XTH8</em> and <em>XTH31</em> gene expression led to reduced leaf width, length, and leaf area (<a aria-describedby="bib18" class="usa-link" href="#bib18">Miura and Hasegawa, 2010</a>). The leaf mesophyll of these mutant lines consisted of a large number of small mesophyll cells per unit area (<a aria-describedby="bib18" class="usa-link" href="#bib18">Miura and Hasegawa, 2010</a>). Suppression of <em>XTH21</em> led to a reduction in cellulose, and xyloglucan content with subsequent reductions in both leaf and plant size (<a aria-describedby="bib15" class="usa-link" href="#bib15">Liu et al., 2007</a>). One of the major roles of XTH enzymes is cleavage of cross linkages between cellulose and hemicellulose microfibrils that promotes wall loosening and cell expansion. This may explain the above leaf phenotypes in <em>xth8</em>, <em>xth21</em>, and <em>xth31</em> mutant lines (<a aria-describedby="bib15" class="usa-link" href="#bib15">Liu et al., 2007</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib18" class="usa-link" href="#bib18">Miura and Hasegawa, 2010</a>). Thus, through its effects on cell wall properties, <em>XTH</em> genes may be able to alter C partitioning to leaf area and LMA and thereby affect overall plant growth similar to the role played by <em>CGR</em> genes.</p>
<p>In summary, the results from this study are in agreement with findings from <a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al. (2015)</a> that optimization of leaf area growth and plant growth can be achieved by increased partitioning of C to leaf area growth with concomitant reduction in partitioning to growth in terms of <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> especially during the early vegetative growth phase (<a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al., 2015</a>), and that photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in C partitioning to leaf area and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> growth. In this study, we found that <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> directly affect this relationship by altering the degree of cell expansion and/or adhesion, thereby driving C partitioning by generating C demands for leaf area growth and for growth in terms of <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>.</p></section><section id="s15"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>Our study supports the model that qualitative and quantitative changes in pectin in the cell wall have a significant impact on area-based photosynthesis and respiration through alterations in leaf thickness, mesophyll cell density, and area of the leaf blade. Such changes in mesophyll architecture directly altered <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> and consequently area-based respiration. <em>CGR</em>2 and <em>CGR</em>3 affected area-based photosynthesis by altering CO<sub>2</sub> availability at Rubisco. These genes could affect plant-based photosynthesis by enabling enhanced light capture through larger leaf area. These data emphasizes the importance of pectin methylesterification in fine-tuning cell expansion and size, and adhesion qualities when building an optimum leaf to maximize photosynthesis under different environmental conditions. While thin leaves are associated with reduced <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, it is important to maintain an optimum thickness to maintain sufficient intercellular air spaces that would maintain high internal conductance as reflected in <em>S</em><sub>mes</sub> and <em>S</em><sub>c</sub> and therefore higher carboxylation rates. <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em>, which directly alter the size of the leaf blade and mesophyll architecture, may find applications in the future to improve light interception in crop plant canopies.</p>
<p>Over-expression of <em>CGR2</em> had a significant positive effect on leaf area and plant growth. Suppression of <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> caused a marked increase in <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, and a reduction in leaf area and plant growth. These differences resulted through changes in C partitioning to leaf area growth and growth in terms of <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> and not as a result of altered area-based photosynthesis rates. Therefore, photosynthesis drives plant growth through alterations in C partitioning to new leaf area growth and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a> growth, and this study discovered that pectin methylesterification affects this relationship by directly altering the degree of cell expansion and positioning in the leaves to create dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass thereby driving C partitioning for these processes. Collectively, these results uncover an unexpected connection between cell wall composition and photosynthesis, and support the novel (to our knowledge) model that through its role in modulation of organ development, the cell wall plasticity is a key factor influencing photosynthetic processes in land plants.</p></section></section><section id="s16"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">MATERIALS AND METHODS</h2>

Thin (500-nm) leaf sections (PTXL Ultramicrotome; RMC Boeckeler Instruments, Tucson, AZ) were observed under a SpectralView FV1000 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY), and the distance between the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces was measured to determine leaf thickness.</p>
<p>Micrographs of leaf cross sections were used to determine the number of palisade and spongy parenchyma cells, the total number of cells, and the number of mesophyll cell layers in a 20,000 μm<sup>2</sup> area of a leaf cross section.

<p>Values for area-based photosynthesis obtained during the four harvests were fitted with a polynomial third-order equation to extrapolate area-based photosynthesis through the entire 90 d of the lifecycle. Similarly, measured projected to total leaf area ratios during the four harvests were fitted with a polynomial second-order equation to extrapolate the values over 90 d. These extrapolated values were used in the model as input photosynthesis values and projected to total leaf area ratios over the life span. The model also takes both growth and maintenance respiration into consideration. The model considers maintenance respiration of a plant/particular organ to be proportional to the corresponding dry mass and growth respiration to be proportional to the growth rate (<a aria-describedby="bib19" class="usa-link" href="#bib19">Penning de Vries et al., 1974</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib1" class="usa-link" href="#bib1">Amthor, 1984</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib24" class="usa-link" href="#bib24">Thomas et al., 1993</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib13" class="usa-link" href="#bib13">Lambers et al., 2008</a>). The model has set values for maintenance coefficients (amount of C respired to maintain the existing mass of the plant or specific organ, μmol C g<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), and for growth coefficients (amount of C respired per unit increase in mass, g g<sup>−1</sup>) based on values provided in the literature (<a aria-describedby="bib1" class="usa-link" href="#bib1">Amthor, 1984</a>; <a aria-describedby="bib16" class="usa-link" href="#bib16">Mariko, 1988</a>) and assumes that growth respiration coefficients of leaf growth in terms of area and LMA are the same throughout the lifecycle. The net amount of C available for growth and maintenance processes of the plant is determined as the product of area-based photosynthetic rate and the projected leaf area. Next, C consumed in maintenance respiration and exudation is subtracted to determine the net assimilation rate, which provides the amount of C available for growth. The model then simulates the partitioning of C available for growth to leaf area growth, growth in terms of <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, and root and inflorescence growth based on the set partitioning coefficients that are adjustable to facilitate fitting of the data. Partitioning coefficients vary based on the growth phases. The increase in mass during growth in terms of leaf area and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, and root and inflorescence growth, is calculated by subtracting the C consumed in growth respiration from the total C allocated for growth of that particular organ. Accordingly, the model simulates the increase in leaf area and mass, and the mass of the inflorescence and roots. The model calculated <a class="usa-link" href="#def5">SLA</a>, <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, and leaf, root, and inflorescence mass ratios over time based on the equations given above.</p>
<p>To fit the modeled data to measured data, 16 partitioning coefficient parameters (partitioning to the inflorescence, roots, leaf area and <a class="usa-link" href="#def3">LMA</a>, for each of the four growth phases: germination phase, early and late vegetative phases, and reproductive phase) were adjusted so that the modeled and measured leaf area, mass of inflorescence, root, and leaf matched (<a aria-describedby="bib27" class="usa-link" href="#bib27">Weraduwage et al., 2015</a>). C partitioning data obtained by feeding Arabidopsis rosettes at 29 <a class="usa-link" href="#def1">DAS</a> with <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> were used as initial estimates that were fine-tuned to fit the data. Sensitivity of the model to changes in the inputs was tested in Col-0 by simulating an increase or decrease of 1% in C partitioned to growth processes, and other model inputs, and noting the resulting response in output. The model was considered sensitive, in cases where more than 1% variation occurred in model outputs because of changing a particular input.</p></section><section id="s22"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Statistical Analyses of Experimental Data</h3>
<p>Four to five biological replicates per line were used to collect experimental data at a given time point. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 22 (IBM, Armonk, NY). The effects of altered <em>CGR2</em> and <em>CGR3</em> expression on plant growth and gas exchange were compared using a univariate general linear model and the differences between means were tested by subjecting data to one-way ANOVA at α = 0.05, followed by a Fisher’s Least Significant Difference Test. Measured data presented in figures represent the mean ± standard error (SE).</p></section><section id="s23"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Accession Numbers</h3>
