<p id="Par1">The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (<em>YAP1, RHOA</em>) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (<em>VIM</em>, <em>NES</em>, <em>DES</em>, <em>LMNB2</em>, <em>LMNA</em>), non-canonical Wnt ligands (<em>WNT5A</em>, <em>WNT9A</em>), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (<em>PLCG1</em>, <em>PRKCA</em>) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (<em>TNNT2</em>, <em>VWF</em>, and <em>RUNX2</em>), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.</p></section><section class="abstract" id="Abs2"><h2>Stem cells: Spaceflight changes nature of heart progenitors</h2>
<p id="Par2">Spaceflight alters the developmental status, proliferative potential and migratory ability of heart stem cells. Mary Kearns-Jonker from  Loma Linda University, California, USA, and colleagues characterized the molecular expression profiles of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) obtained from neonatal and adult patients and then cultured them aboard the International Space Station for 12 days. They found that spaceflight impacted the expression of microRNAs and genes related to cell cycling, DNA repair and important signaling events in both populations of CPCs, but there were some important differences. Of note, only neonatal CPCs showed enhanced potential for certain regenerative processes following spaceflight. Understanding the molecular basis for the beneficial effects induced in neonatal CPCs by spaceflight and mimicking these effects on Earth may boost the therapeutic efficacy of cell-based therapies. The findings also inform strategies to preserve the health of CPCs in astronauts as exploration of space expands in the future.</p></section><section id="Sec1"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Introduction</h2>
<p id="Par3">Changes to the cardiovascular system during spaceflight have prompted molecular biologists to understand the mechanisms governing cellular adaptation to culture aboard the International Space Station (ISS). In doing so, researchers have begun to identify therapeutic benefits, such as enhanced stemness, following culture in space and under conditions that approximate weightlessness on Earth. Therefore, increased understanding of the response of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) to spaceflight may not only benefit human health in space, but also provide insights into novel cardiovascular stem cell therapies that can be applied on Earth.</p>
<p id="Par4">Recent research in our own laboratory has shown that neonatal human CPCs cultured under two-dimensional (2D) clinorotation, which approximates weightlessness by rotating the cell culture vessel about a horizontal axis, exhibit increased expression of markers of early cardiovascular development and pluripotency (i.e., <em>MESP1</em>, <em>T</em> (Brachyury), and <em>OCT4</em>) as well as broad changes to microRNA expression.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR1" class="usa-link" href="#CR1">1</a></sup> The changes in microRNA expression experienced by CPCs in these experiments mirrored the expression of similar microRNAs in human embryonic stem cells (ESC) under normal conditions of early cardiovascular development, thereby suggesting that such culture conditions induce an epigenetic environment that favors an earlier development status. Such a state appears increasingly beneficial for cardiovascular repair. For example, the efficacy of multipotent stem cells expressing Isl1<sup>+</sup> and SSEA-1<sup>+</sup> in ameliorating the symptoms of severe heart failure was recently demonstrated in one patient.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR2" class="usa-link" href="#CR2">2</a></sup> Furthermore, KEGG analysis indicated that the microRNAs downregulated in CPCs in these experiments target several signaling pathways, such as MAPK and Wnt, which are relevant to well-characterized repair mechanisms or cardiac stem cell proliferation mechanisms in the heart. For example, non-canonical Wnt ligands (i.e., Wnt2b, Wnt5a, and Wnt9a) have been shown to be associated with the injury response in neonatal rodent heart tissue.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR3" class="usa-link" href="#CR3">3</a></sup> Therefore, our observations suggest that 2D clinorotation may foster a developmental state and signaling events that could enhance the use of CPCs for cardiovascular repair. This is supported by one recent study by Jha et al.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR4" class="usa-link" href="#CR4">4</a></sup>, which demonstrated that human induced pluripotent stem cells more readily differentiate into cardiomyocytes following three-dimensional (3D) (i.e., embryoid) culture under the influence of a random positioning machine. In the context of our previous findings, these experiments may highlight a potential phenomenon in which 2D clinorotation promotes an enhanced state of stemness that results in increased differentiation potential when the cells are returned to normal gravity conditions.</p>
<p id="Par5">It is currently believed that small RhoGTPases act as transducers of the mechanical alterations that are observed under conditions of spaceflight.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR5" class="usa-link" href="#CR5">5</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR6" class="usa-link" href="#CR6">6</a></sup> As actors in the planar cell polarity Wnt pathway, they have central roles in cytoskeletal remodeling. Along with the Hippo pathway and calcium signaling, small RhoGTPases represent one potential molecular substrate of gravity sensing. Notably, in the context of cardiogenesis, these processes are central to maintaining multipotency or directing differentiation.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR7" class="usa-link" href="#CR7">7</a></sup> Despite the early reports of the effects of spaceflight on stem cells, much is unknown about the mechanisms by which CPCs respond to spaceflight or how these cell types develop enhanced stemness. Hence, we are not yet able to leverage the therapeutic potential of spaceflight here on Earth. While current clinical trials to stimulate repair in damaged heart tissue are promising,<sup><a aria-describedby="CR8" class="usa-link" href="#CR8">8</a>–<a aria-describedby="CR10" class="usa-link" href="#CR10">10</a></sup> they are stymied by a failure of cells to engraft into the host tissue and by the use of progenitor types that are restricted in potency.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR11" class="usa-link" href="#CR11">11</a></sup> Therefore, identifying the molecular events that promote enhanced stemness and regenerative potential in CPCs during spaceflight will benefit stem cell-based cardiac repair.</p>
<p id="Par6">The successful use of autologous CPC sources to regenerate heart tissue in a predominately adult population requires additional understanding of the differences between adult and neonatal CPCs. Our laboratory has previously documented differences in age-dependent expression of microRNAs related to MAPK signaling, cytoskeleton regulation, adherens junction expression, and focal adhesion maintenance.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR12" class="usa-link" href="#CR12">12</a></sup> The relationship between these processes and the age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight remain unknown, but they imply deficits in the intracellular transduction of environmental cues in the functional shortcomings of adult CPCs.</p>
<p id="Par7">Therefore, in this study, clonal lines of neonatal and adult human CPCs were cultured aboard the ISS. We sought to identify changes in these CPCs in response to spaceflight that impact signaling, development, and stemness. We then characterized the divergent response of neonatal and adult CPCs to spaceflight. In doing so, we present components of the adaptive cellular response to culture aboard the ISS and their implications for enhancing the regenerative potential of neonatal and adult CPCs.</p></section><section id="Sec2"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Results</h2>

<p id="Par8">CPCs were clonally isolated, expanded, screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit, assessed for viability, and ultimately selected for experiments based upon the expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFRα, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Representative adult and neonatal clones are shown in Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig1">1a</a> and Fig <a class="usa-link" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>.

<p id="Par9">In an effort to understand the relevant signaling events by which CPCs adapt to culture aboard the ISS, we performed microarray analysis to measure broad alterations to transcriptional control. Among both neonatal and adult CPCs, 14 microRNAs exhibited significant alterations in levels of expression (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig1">1e</a>). KEGG analysis by age group (Table <a class="usa-link" href="#MOESM1">S1</a>) indicated that fatty acid biosynthesis, extracellular matrix (ECM)–receptor interactions, and Hippo signaling were the most significantly affected targets of these microRNAs.</p></section><section id="Sec5"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Cytoskeletal maintenance is altered in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs after culture aboard the ISS</h3>
<p id="Par10">Since the pathways targeted by the significantly dysregulated microRNAs affect cytoskeletal remodeling and mechanotransduction pathways (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2a</a>), we sought to measure changes in the expression of <em>YAP1</em>, a gene involved in Hippo signaling; small RhoGTPases; and cytoskeletal molecules. <em>YAP1</em> was significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs (0.24-fold, <em>P</em> &lt; 0.01) and modestly upregulated in adult CPCs (2.6-fold, <em>P</em> &lt; 0.01) (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). This prompted us to assess the mechanosensitive small RhoGTPases, which indicated that only <em>RHOA</em> was significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs (0.15-fold, <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05, Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), which led us to assess the possible effects of spaceflight on cytoskeletal dysregulation. In doing so, we found that the cytoskeletal genes <em>VIM</em>, <em>NES</em>, <em>DES</em>, <em>LMNB2</em>, and <em>LMNA</em> were all significantly upregulated (5.2-, 22-, 6-, 5.1-, and 10-fold, respectively; <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) following spaceflight (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2e</a>). Meanwhile, in adult CPCs, only <em>NES</em> expression decreased significantly (0.30-fold, <em>P</em> &lt; 0.01) (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2d, f</a>).</p>

<p id="Par11">Given the role of small RhoGTPases in non-canonical, planar cell polarity Wnt signaling and the impact of RhoA on regulating calcium signaling,<sup><a aria-describedby="CR13" class="usa-link" href="#CR13">13</a></sup> we sought to assess the expression of genes involved in the canonical and calcium Wnt pathways. (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3a–f</a>). We observed significantly increased expression of <em>GSK3B</em> (6.8-fold, <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) in neonatal CPCs (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3a</a>) and significantly increased expression of <em>CTNNB1</em> (1.9-fold, <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) in adult CPCs (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3d</a>). Since Gsk3β sequesters β-catenin for degradation in the cytoplasm, thereby suggesting suppression of canonical Wnt signaling in neonatal CPCs and the promotion of canonical Wnt signaling in adult CPCs, we measured non-canonical Wnt ligand expression and that of genes in the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway. We measured significantly increased <em>WNT5A</em> and <em>WNT9A</em> expression (36-fold and 17-fold, respectively; <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) in neonatal CPCs (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3b</a>) and significantly decreased <em>WNT9A</em> expression (0.39-fold, <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) in adult CPCs (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig3">3e</a>).

<p id="Par14">Given the elevated expression of early to pre-mesodermal genes in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs, we sought to measure whether spaceflight impacts the expression of CPC and other mesodermal derivative markers. First, following 30 days in orbit, CPCs were returned to Earth and assayed for endothelial-like tube formation using a widely accepted assay to assess the potency of progenitor cells with the capacity to form tube-like structures.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR15" class="usa-link" href="#CR15">15</a></sup> However, endothelial-specific markers were not measured on space-flown CPCs in this assay. Unlike adult CPCs, neonatal CPCs exhibited a significantly reduced ability to form endothelial-like tubes (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4b, c</a>). Representative images of endothelial-like tube formation of neonatal ground (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4d</a>) and ISS (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4e</a>) as well as adult ground (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4f</a>) and ISS (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig4">4g</a>) samples reflect this age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight. This impact of ISS culture on endothelial-like tube formation ability led us to measure the expression of markers of other derivatives: cardiomyocyte (<em>TNNT2</em>), endothelial (<em>VWF</em>), and osteoblast (<em>RUNX2</em>). These markers were all significantly reduced in neonatal, but not adult, CPCs after 12 days in orbit. Since spaceflight induces pre-cardiac mesodermal marker expression, we sought to assess whether markers of the sinoatrial node, which may represent embryonic myocardium maintained in its primitive state,<sup><a aria-describedby="CR16" class="usa-link" href="#CR16">16</a></sup> were modified.

Adult CPCs exhibited a significant decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1/G0 phase (ISS vs Ground: 71% vs 61%, P &lt; 0.01) and neonatal CPCs exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase (ISS vs Ground: 14% vs 17%, P = 0.05) (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig5">5b</a>).

<p id="Par19">In this study, we found that spaceflight exerts broad effects on the developmental status, proliferative potential, and migratory ability of CPCs, some of which occurred in an age-dependent manner. In particular, neonatal CPCs exhibited increased expression of early developmental markers, enhanced proliferative potential, and increased migratory capacity following culture aboard the ISS. Meanwhile, adult CPCs experienced little change in the expression of genes indicative of their developmental state, but exhibited changes to migratory capacity. These findings suggest that broad cytoskeletal modifications resulting from reduced mechanotransduction impart improved migratory and adhesion capabilities (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2a</a>) regardless of age, but that neonatal CPCs are able to propagate or experience additional intracellular signaling events (e.g., calcium signaling) that modify their developmental status. As we have shown elsewhere, one important difference between adult and neonatal CPCs is their epigenetic (i.e., microRNA) environment.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR12" class="usa-link" href="#CR12">12</a></sup></p>
<p id="Par20">Several microRNAs were observed to be differentially regulated in response to spaceflight in neonatal and adult CPCs. Interestingly, the predicted targets of these microRNAs included activators and repressors of several pathways. A detailed inspection of the putative targets under each pathway impacted by the microRNAs identified in this study revealed the targeting of genes relating to Wnt signaling (<em>FZD3</em>, <em>FZD5</em>, <em>FZD7</em>, <em>FZD8</em>), cytoskeletal regulation (<em>ACTB</em>, <em>ACTG1</em>, <em>LAMC3</em>), cardiovascular development (<em>TGFBR1</em>, <em>BMP2</em>, <em>BMP5</em>, <em>SMAD7</em>), integrin function (<em>ITGB4</em>, <em>ITGAV</em>), extracellular proteins (<em>COL4A2</em>, <em>COL5A1</em>, <em>COL1A1</em>, <em>COL1A2</em>, <em>COL4A1)</em>, and Hippo signaling (<em>TEAD1</em>, <em>YAP1</em>, <em>LATS1</em>). Interestingly, miR-16, whose expression was generally elevated in neonatal CPCs and repressed in adult CPCs, directly targets <em>YAP1</em>, which could account, at least in part, for the age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight. However, since KEGG analysis only identifies broad categories of genes (i.e., functional categories) that are likely targets of the microRNAs under study, further experiments are warranted to identify the cumulative impact of these microRNAs on signaling in space-flown CPCs.</p>
<p id="Par21">These results motivated us to assess the overall impact of spaceflight on <em>YAP1</em>, an effector of Hippo signaling that functions with TAZ to regulate transcription. Activation of Hippo kinases, such as through a loss of microRNA-mediated repression or through reduced mechanical signaling, results in elevated levels of phosphorylated Yap1 and Taz. This prevents translocation of these transcriptional activators to the nucleus. Similarly, the application of 2D clinorotation to bone mesenchymal stem cells prevented TAZ translocation to the nucleus, thereby preventing the expression of <em>RUNX2</em> and inhibiting osteogenesis.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR20" class="usa-link" href="#CR20">21</a></sup> Similarly, the decreased expression of <em>YAP1</em> and <em>RUNX2</em> observed in this experiment indicate that spaceflight reduces mechanotransduction in neonatal CPCs.</p>
<p id="Par22">In addition to broadly targeting the Hippo signaling pathway and ECM interactions, select microRNAs that were modified by culture aboard the ISS are known to be critically involved in cardiac development. For example, miR-142-3p is involved in targeting genes involved in early cardiac development, such as <em>TBX5</em>.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR21" class="usa-link" href="#CR21">22</a></sup> Meanwhile, miR-302, which targets the type II BMP receptor to regulate early cardiogenic events, is repressed by Bmp4 in a Smad-dependent manner.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR22" class="usa-link" href="#CR22">23</a></sup> Interestingly, we observed both reduced expression of miR-302c and elevated expression of <em>BMP4</em> in CPCs that were cultured aboard the ISS. Moreover, studies have demonstrated a direct mechanistic role of certain microRNAs in cardiac regeneration. As neonatal mice age, their cardiomyocytes lose their proliferative potential in a manner that is concomitant with increased let-7 family expression,<sup><a aria-describedby="CR23" class="usa-link" href="#CR23">24</a></sup> thereby indicating a relationship between let-7 over-expression and reduced proliferative potential. Indeed, let-7c along with miR-99/100, which were significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs, are also critically downregulated during cardiomyocyte proliferation in a zebrafish model after ventricle amputation.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR24" class="usa-link" href="#CR24">25</a></sup> As part of the amputation injury response, zebrafish cardiomyocytes near the site of injury undergo sarcomeric structure disassembly as a form of limited de-differentiation to prepare myocytes for self-renewal. <em>PLK1</em>, which was upregulated in CPCs cultured aboard the ISS, is involved in this process.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR25" class="usa-link" href="#CR25">26</a></sup> Interestingly, these changes to the cytoarchitecture of cardiomyocytes and subsequent limited de-differentiation appears to resemble the effects of 2D clinorotation<sup><a aria-describedby="CR12" class="usa-link" href="#CR12">12</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR26" class="usa-link" href="#CR26">27</a></sup> and spaceflight on CPCs.</p>
<p id="Par23">Our laboratory has previously measured changes in microRNA expression in neonatal CPCs induced by 2D clinorotation.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR12" class="usa-link" href="#CR12">12</a></sup> In comparing those findings to the microRNA changes induced by culture aboard the ISS, we found miR-99a and -100 as well as members of the let-7 family, all of which are implicated in differentiation and developmental regulation, exhibit significantly reduced expression under both conditions. Additionally, we have previously compared the effects of spaceflight and 2D clinorotation on the induction of signaling in neonatal CCPs and observed similar activation of calcium and Akt signaling under both conditions. Similarly, both clinorotation and spaceflight induced a gene expression profile that was consistent with an earlier stage of cardiovascular development, and that mechanical signaling processes were involved, at least in part, in mediating these effects. When considered together, these findings indicate that both processes readily alter the developmental properties of neonatal CPCs, possibly through reduced mechanotransduction. Therefore, the recapitulation of spaceflight-induced signaling events using clinorotation may represent an avenue by which ongoing studies can be conducted. This comparative study also allows for the separation of effects due to cell culture stress from those due to mechanical unloading since 2D clinorotation, which utilized cell cultures that were maintained under ideal conditions, elicited a similar effect as spaceflight.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR26" class="usa-link" href="#CR26">27</a></sup></p>
<p id="Par24">Alterations to microRNA expression as well as changes to ECM interactions in ISS-cultured CPCs highlight the significance of the environment in directing differentiation. For example, a single population of mesenchymal stem cells can express neurogenic, myogenic, or osteogenic transcription factors when cultured on soft, moderately stiff, or stiff matrices, respectively.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR27" class="usa-link" href="#CR27">28</a></sup> In our experiments, we observed elevated expression of mesendodermal-stage developmental markers in neonatal CPCs. It is likely that ECM interactions prompted cytoskeleton remodeling while modifying intracellular signaling pathways such that proliferation and stemness were enhanced. Similar experiments in different cell types involving clinorotation or a low Earth orbit cell culture system have demonstrated that such systems modify the differentiation potential of stem cells. Mouse ESCs flown as embryoid bodies during the Space Tissue Loss Experiment exhibited a decrease in the expression of markers of terminal germ layer derivatives while maintaining expression of stem cell renewal markers.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR28" class="usa-link" href="#CR28">29</a></sup> However, upon return to Earth, these mouse ESCs differentiated more readily into colonies of contracting cardiomyocytes. Mesenchymal stem cells cultured under conditions of 2D or 3D clinorotation exhibit a reduction in the expression of markers of cartilage and osteoblast formation,<sup><a aria-describedby="CR29" class="usa-link" href="#CR29">30</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR30" class="usa-link" href="#CR30">31</a></sup> while also demonstrating enhanced proliferation potential and the maintenance or enhancement of stemness under such clinorotation.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR29" class="usa-link" href="#CR29">30</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR31" class="usa-link" href="#CR31">32</a></sup></p>
<p id="Par25">In addition to the expression of genes that are indicative of an earlier stage of development, neonatal CPCs exhibited both a reduced capacity to readily form endothelial-like tubes, as evidenced by the absence of any tube-like structures being formed that are indicative of endothelial-potential,<sup><a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR15" class="usa-link" href="#CR15">15</a></sup> and decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (i.e., cardiomyocte, endothelium, and osteoblast) in response to spaceflight. Notably, the increased expression of sinoatrial nodal markers may reflect the emerging hypothesis that this unique functional cell type develops from myocardium that retains its primitive phenotype.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR16" class="usa-link" href="#CR16">16</a></sup> Accordingly, the concomitant increased expression of sinoatrial nodal genes and decreased expression of other mesodermal derivatives indicates that spaceflight promotes the modest de-differentiation of neonatal CPCs. Additionally, the elevated expression of Tbx proteins, particularly, Tbx3, overlaps with previous reports in the regulation of pre-mesoderm (i.e., mesendoderm) gene expression.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR32" class="usa-link" href="#CR32">33</a></sup></p>
<p id="Par26">This concomitant induction of mesendodermal markers and Tbx gene expression reflects the potential therapeutic value of spaceflight for cardiac repair. The critical role of the Tbx family in cardiac development has been well documented<sup><a aria-describedby="CR33" class="usa-link" href="#CR33">34</a></sup> and its application to cellular therapies for cardiac repair is beginning to be explored. For example, SSEA-1<sup>+</sup> early cardiovascular progenitors expressing <em>T</em>, <em>TBX5</em>, and <em>TBX18</em>, were shown to engraft into non-human primate myocardium following infarction.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR34" class="usa-link" href="#CR34">35</a></sup> Meanwhile, <em>Tbx5</em> and <em>Tbx18</em> are expressed in highly migratory and proliferative proepicardial cell lineages.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR35" class="usa-link" href="#CR35">36</a>,<a aria-describedby="CR36" class="usa-link" href="#CR36">37</a></sup> These studies have demonstrated an increasingly appreciated observation that Tbx expression is related to the engraftment and function of CPCs following transplantation.</p>
<p id="Par27">Beyond directing developmental events via alterations in intracellular signaling, disrupted cytoskeletal organization impacts migration. In other models, cytoskeletal re-organization induces the expression of <em>CXCR4</em>, the SDF-1α chemokine receptor.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR37" class="usa-link" href="#CR37">38</a></sup> As seen in our experiments, both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited elevated expression of <em>SDF1A</em>, which correlates to the age-independent increase in migratory capacity of CPCs following spaceflight.</p>
<p id="Par28">Interestingly, the age-dependent changes in developmental status following culture aboard the ISS suggest fundamental differences in adult CPCs. While KEGG analysis demonstrated that functionally similar pathways are likely affected in both adult and neonatal CPCs, only the latter population experienced significant changes to the expression of cytoskeletal genes and early developmental markers. This trend was supported by the significantly increased cell cycle and proliferation patterns observed only in neonatal CPCs. Broad differences have already been reported to exist between adult and neonatal CPCs, including at the genetic/epigenetic<sup><a aria-describedby="CR12" class="usa-link" href="#CR12">12</a></sup> and proteomic levels.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR38" class="usa-link" href="#CR38">39</a></sup> In particular, the secretome of adult CPCs was found to exhibit a greater number of proteins related to anti-proliferation, pro-apoptosis, and senescence. Meanwhile, the secretome of neonatal CPCs exhibited higher levels of telomerases as well as proteins related to cell cycle, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR38" class="usa-link" href="#CR38">39</a></sup> Similarly, we observed age-disparate responses to spaceflight in nearly all of these categories. In the context of this experiment, microRNA dysregulation may have exerted a greater effect on neonatal CPCs given their relatively higher levels of expression of genes related to these processes. Nevertheless, the prospective use of CPCs in autologous cardiac stem cell therapies in a predominately adult population requires that these functional differences be elucidated.</p>
<p id="Par29">Although the ISS represents a truly unique opportunity to conduct life science research in space, there are several limitations that do not exist in the well-controlled laboratory environments on Earth. In addition to the stress associated with rocket launch, the limited availability of astronauts once aboard the ISS impacts the otherwise routine maintenance of cell cultures. For this reason, future research should consider the influence of various spaceflight-related stressors, such as sheer and vibrational stressors, on stem cell processes under normal gravity conditions. For example, we have shown that 2D clinorotation on Earth, which was performed in a carefully controlled laboratory setting, impacted the developmental properties of CPCs in a manner that was similar to spaceflight.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR26" class="usa-link" href="#CR26">27</a></sup></p>
<p id="Par30">As humans prepare to expand our presence in space, it is imperative to deepen our understanding of the nature of cellular adaptation to spaceflight so that we may develop mechanisms by which these molecular changes in cardiac cell types can be countered. Meanwhile, on Earth, we can further explore the therapeutic potential of these adaptations for cardiac repair.</p></section><section id="Sec15"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Methods</h2>
<section id="Sec16"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Isolation and culture of early CPCs</h3>
<p id="Par31">CPCs were isolated from cardiac tissue of neonatal (1 day–1 month) or adult (57–72 year old) human patients, as previously described.<sup><a aria-describedby="CR26" class="usa-link" href="#CR26">27</a></sup> The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University for the use of discarded tissue without identifiable private information under a waiver of informed consent. Thus, informed consent was not required since the discarded tissue was not collected specifically for this study, and the tissue was obtained with no identifiable patient-specific information. Briefly, atrial tissue was cut into small clumps (approximately 1.0 mm<sup>3</sup>) then enzymatically digested using collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at a working concentration of 1 mg/mL. The resulting solution was then passed through a 40-µm cell strainer. Cells were cloned in a 96-well plate by limiting dilution to a final concentration of 0.8 cells per well to create populations for expansion. Cells were then screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit. Clonal CPC cultures were selected for other markers of early cardiac development (KDR and PDGFRA) and then supplemented with growth media comprised of 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), 100 µg/mL penicillin–streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 1% minimum essential medium non-essential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and 22% endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) in Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Mycoplasma contamination was tested using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer’s protocol.</p></section><section id="Sec17"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Flow cytometry</h3>
<p id="Par32">Progenitor cell populations were fluorescently labeled with antibodies, as recommended by their respective manufacturers. Briefly, for developmental marker detection, CPCs were incubated with Viobility 405/520 before being washed in 1 × PBS (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 0.5% BSA (Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL) and 2 mM EDTA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Then, CPCs were stained for cardiac-related stem cell surface markers (PDGFRα, CXCR4, c-Kit, and SSEA1). CPCs were then fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), blocked in 0.6 M glycine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution containing 10% BSA (Research Products International Corp, Mt. Prospect, IL), and stained for intracellular, cardiac-related stem cell surface markers (Isl1 and Mesp1). For directed differentiation assays, cells were stained for TropT after being fixed in 4% PFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or directly for vWF or SMA. Stained CPCs were then analyzed using a MACSQuant® analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Quantification of data was performed using FlowJo software version 10 (Ashland, OR). Compensation was performed using UltraComp eBeads (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, one drop of compensation beads were incubated with each antibody individually for 30 min at 4 °C and then detected using the same MACSQuant® analyzer just prior to experiments requiring compensation. FlowJo was then used to generate a compensation matrix, which was applied to all experimental data.

Then, 1 ng/mL TGF-β (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 0.1 mM ascorbic acid (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in fresh differentiation media was added routinely until day 14, at which time cells were stained for TropT or placed in TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis. To generate endothelium, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent, at which time the growth media was replaced with endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 25 ng/mL Bmp4 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 50 ng/mL Vegf (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2 days. The media was then replaced with endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) containing 50 ng/mL Vegf and cultured for 4 days. Then, cells were regularly fed endothelial cell growth media (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) until day 14, at which time cells were stained for vWF, placed in TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for gene expression analysis, or seeded onto Matrigel for endothelial-like tube formation assay analysis, as described below. Finally, to generate smooth muscle cells, CPCs were cultured in growth media (see above) until 85% confluent, at which time the growth media was replaced with DMEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing 4.5 g/L <span class="font-variant-small-caps">d</span>-glucose, 2% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 50 ng/mL PDGF-BB (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

The seeding conditions were carefully titrated on Earth to identify the most optimal conditions under which CPCs could be cultured over the course of the experiment. These conditions were then tested during an Experiment Verification Test, which was performed with BioServe Space Technologies ahead of the mission launch. They were then flown aboard SpaceX CRS-11 to the US National Lab on the ISS where they were placed in an incubator containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air. Fresh media was provided every 4 to 5 days while aboard the ISS (Fig <a class="usa-link" href="#MOESM1">S3</a>). At 12 days, the Biocells that were seeded with 7500 cells were flooded with RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at −80 °C. At 30 days, the Biocells seeded with 5000 cells were fed and returned to Earth.
