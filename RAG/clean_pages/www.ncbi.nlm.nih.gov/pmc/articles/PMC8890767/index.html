<section id="sec1"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Purpose</h3>
<p id="Par1">Intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) and other sulfated polysaccharides are potential prophylactics for COVID-19. The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity.</p></section><section id="sec2"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Methods</h3>
<p id="Par2">Double-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60Â ng to 60Â Î¼g) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by <em>in vivo</em> imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000Â U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects.</p></section><section id="sec3"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Results</h3>
<p id="Par3">UFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. <em>In vivo</em> imaging in a mouse model showed a single phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12Â h, 3.2% of the administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels by 48Â h.</p></section><section id="sec4"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Conclusions</h3>
<p id="Par4">UFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12Â h after dosing.</p></section><section id="sec5"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Supplementary Information</h3>

<p id="Par5">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to severe social and economic consequences spanning the entire world (<a aria-describedby="CR1" class="usa-link" href="#CR1">1</a>, <a aria-describedby="CR2" class="usa-link" href="#CR2">2</a>). Despite active vaccination programs and implementation of social distancing parameters, the number of infections and deaths in the world remain significantly high and new highly transmissible strains are emerging (<a aria-describedby="CR3" class="usa-link" href="#CR3">3</a>). SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic betacoronavirus (<a aria-describedby="CR4" class="usa-link" href="#CR4">4</a>) transmitted via person to person mainly through air droplets (<a aria-describedby="CR5" class="usa-link" href="#CR5">5</a>) and sometimes fecal-oral routes (<a aria-describedby="CR6" class="usa-link" href="#CR6">6</a>), potentially infecting nasal, lung, and intestinal tissues (<a aria-describedby="CR7" class="usa-link" href="#CR7">7</a>). Currently, there are no highly effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19, making effective prevention an essential public health goal.</p>
<p id="Par6">SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is initiated by molecular interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (also known as S-protein) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) displayed on the host cell surfaces (<a aria-describedby="CR8" class="usa-link" href="#CR8">8</a>â€“<a aria-describedby="CR11" class="usa-link" href="#CR11">11</a>). Several viruses from different virus families are known to utilize HSPG as their attachment receptors (<a aria-describedby="CR12" class="usa-link" href="#CR12">12</a>), for example, parainfluenza (<a aria-describedby="CR13" class="usa-link" href="#CR13">13</a>), adenovirus (<a aria-describedby="CR14" class="usa-link" href="#CR14">14</a>â€“<a aria-describedby="CR16" class="usa-link" href="#CR16">16</a>), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<a aria-describedby="CR17" class="usa-link" href="#CR17">17</a>, <a aria-describedby="CR18" class="usa-link" href="#CR18">18</a>), cytomegalovirus (<a aria-describedby="CR16" class="usa-link" href="#CR16">16</a>, <a aria-describedby="CR19" class="usa-link" href="#CR19">19</a>), and herpes simplex virus (<a aria-describedby="CR20" class="usa-link" href="#CR20">20</a>). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the S-protein-HSPG interaction is followed by binding of S-protein to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (<a aria-describedby="CR21" class="usa-link" href="#CR21">21</a>â€“<a aria-describedby="CR26" class="usa-link" href="#CR26">26</a>). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host HSPG is essential for the progression of virus entry and infection cycle, as evidenced by disruption of virus entry by exogenously administered sulfated polysaccharides, which compete with cell surface HSPGs. The sulfated polysaccharides that have already been investigated as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents include heparin, heparin derivatives and glycosaminoglycan analogs (<a aria-describedby="CR9" class="usa-link" href="#CR9">9</a>, <a aria-describedby="CR10" class="usa-link" href="#CR10">10</a>, <a aria-describedby="CR27" class="usa-link" href="#CR27">27</a>). These sulfated polysaccharides are likely to remain effective against emerging variants of concern (VOC) that partially evade vaccine-induced immune response due to differences in polysaccharide and antibody binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (<a aria-describedby="CR10" class="usa-link" href="#CR10">10</a>) and the conserved nature of the polybasic furin cleavage site, one of the major sites of heparin interaction and activity (<a aria-describedby="CR28" class="usa-link" href="#CR28">28</a>).</p>
<p id="Par7">Since the major route of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly initiated by airborne droplet infection of nasal tissues, it is reasonable to consider the design of potentially novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, like UFH, for intranasal administration (<a aria-describedby="CR9" class="usa-link" href="#CR9">9</a>, <a aria-describedby="CR11" class="usa-link" href="#CR11">11</a>). Such an approach may lead to the discovery of novel anticoronaviral agents with high efficacy, fast mechanisms of action, wide therapeutic windows, and non-invasive self-administration protocols for a possible prophylactic use. While heparin administration by injection is already FDA-approved for other uses, potential antiviral utility against coronaviruses is just being explored. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of UFH, particularly regarding the potential consequences of repeated administration to the nasal cavity. Preliminary tests regarding clearance, pharmacokinetics, and safety must be undertaken prior to implementing the actual clinical nasal application of a potentially useful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, like heparin, which is already FDA-approved for use by administration via other routes. In this work, a series of <em>in vivo</em> pharmacological and toxicological aspects of intranasally administered UFH in mice were investigated. Blood histology, coagulation, olfactory behavior, drug clearance, and adverse outcomes were assessed in mice, and safety was evaluated in a small healthy human sample population. Primary objectives for the human study were the measurement of systemic bioavailability based on increased blood coagulation properties using aPTT and INR measurements. Platelet count was also observed to detect any potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Finally, episodes of epistaxis were monitored to measure for localized damage to mucus membranes and/or localized anti-coagulation activity.</p>
<p id="Par8">Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that the intranasal administration of UFH solution will readily deliver the UFH to the nasal passages and will be safe with no or minimal toxic effects in mice or humans. Results indicate efficient delivery, extended retention of heparin in the nasal passages, and clearance of intranasally administered UFH with no major adverse effects.</p></section><section id="Sec2"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Methods</h2>

<em>In vivo</em> imaging experiments were performed on six (three male, three female) SKH1-Elite mice (Crl:SKH1<em>-Hr</em><sup><em>hr</em></sup> Outbred: Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). One female mouse exhibited poor response to the anesthetic resulting in significant movement during imaging, so data for this mouse were excluded from the nasal clearance kinetics modeling. All animals for toxicology studies were housed in the AALAC-accredited University of Mississippi Animal Facility and given access to rodent chow (Cat.# 7001, Envigo Teklad 4% Fat Rodent Diet) and tap water <em>ad libitum</em> for the duration of the experiments. Mice were group-housed (3â€“4 mice/cage) in climate-controlled rooms (30â€“40% relative humidity, 21â€“23Â°C) under a 12:12Â h light/dark cycle (lights on at 06:00). All mice were acclimated to the vivarium colony room for five days prior to initiating the drug administration regimen. Upon completion of the study, mice were anesthetized with vaporized isofluorane, perfused with phosphate buffer saline, and secondarily euthanized with decapitation.

Mice were food deprived (water ad lib) immediately following Day 14 of IN drug administration to motivate subjects, and tested 24-h later (signs of distress were monitored while food deprived). On test day, the subject was placed in a test chamber containing 3Â cm of fresh 1/8 in corncob bedding for a 15-min trial, with the food stimulus buried approximately 1Â cm below the bedding surface in a randomly assigned corner of the cage. The subject successfully completed the assay when it uncovered the food stimulus and began to eat, using one or both forepaws on the food. Latency to uncover and eat the food served as the dependent measure. Each trial had a maximum latency of 900Â s.

Six volunteers (three male, three female) between the ages of 18 and 61 (mean age 31Â yr) were included in the non-randomized exploratory study after screening ten participants in Oxford, MS (Table I). The six participants were selected based on subject availability during the preferred study dates; the remaining four were retained as replacement subjects in case of participant withdrawal.

<p id="Par22">Administration was carried out in two phases: an acute phase to determine tolerability of two doses, and a chronic phase to determine tolerability of repeated daily doses using U-line nasal spray bottle with pump over a two-week period. During the acute phase, volunteers applied a single spray of 500Â U to each nostril on Day 1 in the clinic and volunteers were observed for one hour for adverse events. Whole blood was drawn by venipuncture 24Â h after dosing to allow for aPTT measurement. If the aPTT value remained in the clinically normal range, volunteers applied a single spray of 1000Â U to each nostril on Day 3 in the clinic. Again, aPTT was measured 24Â h post-dosing. No differences in aPTT levels were observed at either dose in the acute phase, thus all participants entered the chronic phase of the intervention. A five-day washout period was used between the acute phase and the chronic phase.</p>
<p id="Par23">During the chronic phase, each volunteer had a single 1000Â U heparin spray per nostril administered on Day 1 in the clinic, and the subject was observed for adverse events.

Volunteers maintained a dosing journal to document self-administration. Follow-up calls were made on Day 4, Day 7, Day 9 and Day 11 to check on subject compliance, response and adverse events. Blood was drawn after the final dose on Day 14 in the clinic for aPTT measurement. Blood was drawn 24Â h after the final dose, on Day 15, and two weeks following completion of the study (Day 30) for aPTT, PT/INR and platelet count measurements.

<p id="Par24">Varying doses of heparin or vehicle control were administered to the nasal cavities of male and female mice once per day for 14 consecutive days to monitor safety and tolerability with this route of administration. Block randomization was used to assign dosing groups of 5Â mg/L (0.06Â Î¼g/day), 50Â mg/L (0.6Â Î¼g/day), 500Â mg/L (6Â Î¼g/day), and 5000Â mg/L (60Â Î¼g/day) heparin formulated in 5Â mg/mL sodium chloride, 1% benzyl alcohol (pHÂ 5.0â€“7.5). 12Â Î¼L (6Â Î¼L/nostril) were administered daily via drop pipetting into the nasal cavity during inspiration. Notes were taken on animal appearance, grooming, signs of distress, and other notable behaviors twice daily throughout the treatment period. Detailed results are shown in Supplementary Table <a class="usa-link" href="#MOESM1">1</a>. As expected with this developmental stage, both cohorts of male and female mice exhibited small weight gains over the 14-day drug treatment. Two-way multiple comparison ANOVA indicated a main effect of sex on weight, but no treatment effect when all groups were compared. When sex was considered independently, a one-way ANOVA revealed no difference in the extent of weight gain between any of the treatment doses in females (pâ€‰&gt;â€‰0.05). In males, between group differences were observed and a post-hoc Bonferonni test revealed a statistically significant increase in weight gain in mice treated with 6Â Î¼g/day heparin <em>versus</em> vehicle-only control (mean: 1.33Â g gain vs 0.33Â g gain, pâ€‰=â€‰0.018). No differences in the weights of mice receiving lower or higher doses were observed (Fig.Â <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig1">1</a>).</p>

Minor irritation (pink discoloration) and minor swelling of the nose was observed in a few animals throughout the 14Â day protocol, with no differences in prevalence across groups. Only one mouse (male, 6Â Î¼g/day heparin) showed irritation on more than one day of the study and the three days of observed irritation were non-consecutive and ended on day 10. No signs of epistaxis or topical bleeding were evident in any mice during the study (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig1">1</a>). Overall, the frequency of observed minor effects for heparin-dosed animals were small and consistent between males and females (0.29â€‰Â±â€‰0.07 events per day for males, 0.29â€‰Â±â€‰0.10 events per day for females). No dose-dependence was observed in the frequency of minor effects for heparin-dosed animals (Fig.Â <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig2">2</a>).

<em>In Vivo</em> Imaging of Instranasal Heparin Clearance Kinetics</h3>
<p id="Par28">Of key concern in any therapeutic strategy involving nasal administration of heparin to block viral attachment and entry to nasal epithelial cells is the pharmacokinetics of heparin clearance from the nasal cavity. Unlike residence in the lungs (<a aria-describedby="CR29" class="usa-link" href="#CR29">29</a>), the mucosa of the nasal cavity is constantly cleared into the stomach which can drive intranasal drug clearance. However, heparin has many physical and chemical features that are not common in nasally administered drugs, being much larger and having high negative charge density. To test the lifetime of heparin in the nasal cavity, we labeled heparin at the reducing end with a near-IR chemical dye through an oxime linkage, resulting in a single dye molecule (95Â Da) per heparin molecule (avg. ~15,000Â Da). After purification, the resulting CF680R-heparin showed no substantial presence of unconjugated dye by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig.Â <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig6">6A</a>). The resulting CF680R-heparin has biophysical characteristics almost identical to unmodified heparin, while having quantitative near-IR fluorescence that can be imaged in the living mouse. Due to the intensity of the signal, we administered a dose of 1.67Â Î¼g of CF680R-heparin to the mouse and quantified the fluorescence signal in the nasal cavity. A comparison of fits test failed to show a statistically significant improvement in model quality for a two-phase model (<em>p</em>â€‰=â€‰0.37), with a one-phase exponential decay model fitting the observed data well (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig6">6B</a>). The observed half-life of the heparin in the nasal cavity was 39.34Â min (95% CI 22.7â€“66.6Â min). At the goal of 12Â h protection time post-dose, we retain ~3.2% of the initial heparin dose in the nasal cavity. Based on an average mouse nasal cavity volume of 32Â mm<sup>3</sup> (<a aria-describedby="CR30" class="usa-link" href="#CR30">30</a>) and an initial dose of 60Â Î¼g found to be safe for repeated daily dosing in mice, our model indicates we should retain 60Â mg/L heparin in the nasal cavity after 12Â h, 10,000 times higher than the heparin IC<sub>50</sub> measured for inhibiting pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry (<a aria-describedby="CR9" class="usa-link" href="#CR9">9</a>). Movement of the fluorescence signal is consistent with passage through the nasopharynx and into the digestive tract during mucus clearance (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig6">6C</a>).</p>

<p id="Par29">Heparin was administered to six healthy human volunteers (three male, three female) in two phases. The initial acute phase was performed at two intranasal doses (1000Â U/day and 2000Â U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily) to monitor for acute adverse effects. No adverse effects were reported during the acute phase, so the chronic phase was performed at 2000Â U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily to monitor for longer-term effects after fourteen consecutive days of daily dosing. Effects of intranasal heparin on blood coagulation parameters were followed via an aPTT test 24Â h after each dose in the acute phase, as well as immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24Â h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16Â days after the final dose in the chronic phase (16Â day washout period). An INR test was also performed 24Â h after the final dose in the chronic phase, as well as 16Â days after the final dose in the chronic phase. In all cases, no evidence of systemic bioavailability of heparin was observed based on changes in blood coagulation times compared to the pre-study screening results or the clinically normal range (Fig.Â <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig7">7A and B</a>). Platelet counts were also performed during pre-study screening, immediately after the final dose in the chronic phase, 24Â h after the final dose in the chronic phase, and 16Â days after the final dose in the chronic phase. No evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed based on changes in platelet count compared to pre-study values or clinically normal ranges (Fig. <a class="usa-link" href="#Fig7">7C</a>). Subjects also reported mild adverse events, summarized in Table <a class="usa-link" href="#Tab1">I</a>. Two subjects reported mild nasal irritation and/or sneezing after administration, consistent with exposure to the benzyl alcohol found in the heparin formulation. One subject reported spontaneous brief epistaxis during sedentary time on Day 7 of the chronic phase, as well as seven days after the last dose of the chronic phase. Follow-up questioning indicated that this subject had a history of epistaxis that was undisclosed during screening. These early Phase 1 results support that heparin administered intranasally is tolerableat doses up to 2000Â U/day for at least 14Â days, with no clinically significant systemic distribution of the heparin and no effect on blood coagulation.</p>

<p id="Par30">Our results demonstrated that UFH produces no local nor systemic adverse effects when administered intranasally to either mice or human volunteers. We observed no signs of nasal inflammation, epistaxis, alterations on platelet count that could lead to potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and significant changes on the aPTT analysis. Our findings revealed no overt signs of toxicity nor disruption of olfactory functions in mice administered UFH intranasally over two weeks at doses up to 60Â Î¼g/day. From the findings of <em>in vivo</em> imaging, we observed a two-phase clearance of intranasal UFH from the nasal cavity, with protective concentrations still present 12Â h post-dosing, in which approximately 2% of the starting dose remained in the cavity until background levels were again reached after 12 additional hours. No significant changes were observed for aPTT, PT/INR, and platelet counts in human volunteers, indicating that intranasal administration of heparin is tolerable at doses up to at least 2000Â U/day for at least 14Â days. The lack of both local irritation and systemic bioavailability suggest that intranasal heparin may have a high tolerance with a potentially large therapeutic window for preventing viral infections from respiratory viruses that use heparan sulfate as a co-receptor, including SARS-CoV-2.</p></section><section id="sec24"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">Supplementary Information</h2>
