                    <td colspan="3"> This project has accomplished one of its two milestones, and the updated summary provided now reflects not only the conceptual genesis of the project, but also as it was refined as the project progressed. While, of course, the original essence remains, what is presented here is the summit of the first milestone, and precedes previous reports. This milestone is concerned with Earth studies to develop and rigorously test the technology for determining the sensitivity of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) during spaceflight, and to elucidate the genetic basis of whatever change is seen. The second milestone is experimentation during the spaceflight itself, which was launched in late 2017.     <P>
A paper entitled: “Payload hardware and experimental protocol development to enable future testing of the effect of space microgravity on the resistance to gentamicin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and its (sigma)s-deficient mutant,” was published online in May 2017: Life Sciences in Space Research 15 (2017) 1–10 2214-5524/ © 2017 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Published by Elsevier Ltd.; [ <a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001</a>  ] As has been pointed out before, this project represents highly collaborative and collegial collaboration between Stanford and NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The published paper reflects this not only by the joint authorship of it by both Stanford and Moffett Field scientists, but also the benefits that accrue from collaboration between biological expertise (Stanford) and the flight technological expertise (Moffett Field).     <P>

The abstract of this paper, reproduced here (in quotes), succinctly describes the evolved conceptual background, and demonstrates in detail the development of the EcAMSat platform, and its thorough testing using spaceflight-like commands.     <P>
“Human immune response is compromised and bacteria can become more antibiotic resistant in space microgravity (MG). We report that under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), stationary-phase uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) become more resistant to gentamicin (Gm), and that this increase is dependent on the presence of s (a transcription regulator encoded by the rpoS gene). UPEC causes urinary tract infections (UTIs), reported to afflict astronauts; Gm is a standard treatment, so these findings could impact astronaut health. Because LSMMG findings can differ from MG, we report preparations to examine UPEC’s Gm sensitivity during spaceflight using the E. coli Anti-Microbial Satellite (EcAMSat) on a free-flying “nanosatellite” in low Earth orbit. Within EcAMSat’s payload, a 48-microwell fluidic card contains and supports study of bacterial cultures at constant temperature; optical absorbance changes in cell suspensions were made at three wavelengths for each microwell and a fluid-delivery system provided growth medium and predefined Gm concentrations. Performance characterization is reported here for spaceflight prototypes of this payload system. Using conventional microtiter plates, we show that Alamar Blue (AB) absorbance changes can assess the Gm effect on E. coli viability, permitting telemetric transfer of the spaceflight data to Earth. Laboratory results using payload prototypes are consistent with wellplate and flask findings of differential sensitivity of UPEC and its delta rpoS strain to Gm. if (sigma)s plays the same role in space MG as in LSMMG and Earth gravity, countermeasures discovered in recent Earth studies (aimed at weakening the UPEC antioxidant defense) to control UPEC infections would prove useful also in space flights. Further, EcAMSat results should clarify inconsistencies from previous space experiments on bacterial antibiotic sensitivity and other issues.” The manuscript may be consulted for further details and all the relevant references; see Bibliography section in 2017 report.     <P>
In addition, the work has brought to light issues, such as the stress exerted by the flight equipment on bacteria, which we are now in the process of elucidating and ameliorating for the development of better future platforms for spaceflight experimentation on bacterial biology, resistance, and virulence. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is becoming an extremely serious problem on Earth that impacts space travelers harder given the deleterious effect of microgravity on human immune response. The research has confirmed the hypothesis that underpinned it, and has shown the way to enhance effectiveness of antibiotics in general. Subsequent work, which is in progress, has identified compounds whose co-administration with antibiotics will enhance their curative power; these can also permit lowering the needed amount of antibiotics for treating infections, thereby minimizing their side effects. This promises to improve life in space as well as on Earth.    <P></td>

						The spaceflight took place onboard a free-flying “nanosatellite,” which, for the first time utilized a 6-U configuration (a “U” being a 10-cm cube). The experiments were conducted on the EcAMSat hardware platform that we developed and described previously in the task book reports. Cell viability in this platform was measured by changes in the absorption of the dye Alamar Blue (AB); these were telemetered to Earth and recorded by daily communications with the spacecraft at Santa Clara University. Parallel ground controls were run. The flight performed very smoothly and all the needed data were successfully obtained. The major conclusion from the results is that the gene rpoS continues to play a critical role in making urinary pathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) highly resistant to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm). This antibiotic is used to treat urinary tract infections often reported in astronauts. Therefore, the potential small molecule inhibitors that we have identified (using bioinformatics approaches) of the protein encoded by rpoS and the antioxidant proteins it controls hold the promise to promote astronaut health in spaceflights. That these molecules are valuable also in meeting the rampant bacterial antibiotic resistance on Earth has been pointed out before.     <P>
A second important finding is that the high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs) used to simulate microgravity on Earth did indeed provide correct information of UPEC biology in this respect because it is with the use of this system that we had first discovered the rpoS role in Gm resistance. The cumulative work on this grant earned the entire EcAMSat team individual NASA awards.    <P>
The publication  concerning this work will be submitted within the coming weeks. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This project has accomplished one of its two milestones, and the updated summary provided now reflects not only the conceptual genesis of the project, but also as it was refined as the project progressed. While, of course, the original essence remains, what is presented here is the summit of the first milestone, and precedes previous reports. This milestone is concerned with Earth studies to develop and rigorously test the technology for determining the sensitivity of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) during spaceflight, and to elucidate the genetic basis of whatever change is seen. The second milestone is experimentation during the spaceflight itself, which was launched in late 2017.     <P>
A paper entitled: “Payload hardware and experimental protocol development to enable future testing of the effect of space microgravity on the resistance to gentamicin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and its (sigma)s-deficient mutant,” was published online in May 2017: Life Sciences in Space Research 15 (2017) 1–10 2214-5524/ © 2017 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Published by Elsevier Ltd.; [ <a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001</a>  ] As has been pointed out before, this project represents highly collaborative and collegial collaboration between Stanford and NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The published paper reflects this not only by the joint authorship of it by both Stanford and Moffett Field scientists, but also the benefits that accrue from collaboration between biological expertise (Stanford) and the flight technological expertise (Moffett Field).     <P>

The abstract of this paper, reproduced here (in quotes), succinctly describes the evolved conceptual background, and demonstrates in detail the development of the EcAMSat platform, and its thorough testing using spaceflight-like commands.     <P>
“Human immune response is compromised and bacteria can become more antibiotic resistant in space microgravity (MG). We report that under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), stationary-phase uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) become more resistant to gentamicin (Gm), and that this increase is dependent on the presence of s (a transcription regulator encoded by the rpoS gene). UPEC causes urinary tract infections (UTIs), reported to afflict astronauts; Gm is a standard treatment, so these findings could impact astronaut health. Because LSMMG findings can differ from MG, we report preparations to examine UPEC’s Gm sensitivity during spaceflight using the E. coli Anti-Microbial Satellite (EcAMSat) on a free-flying “nanosatellite” in low Earth orbit. Within EcAMSat’s payload, a 48-microwell fluidic card contains and supports study of bacterial cultures at constant temperature; optical absorbance changes in cell suspensions were made at three wavelengths for each microwell and a fluid-delivery system provided growth medium and predefined Gm concentrations. Performance characterization is reported here for spaceflight prototypes of this payload system. Using conventional microtiter plates, we show that Alamar Blue (AB) absorbance changes can assess the Gm effect on E. coli viability, permitting telemetric transfer of the spaceflight data to Earth. Laboratory results using payload prototypes are consistent with wellplate and flask findings of differential sensitivity of UPEC and its delta rpoS strain to Gm. if (sigma)s plays the same role in space MG as in LSMMG and Earth gravity, countermeasures discovered in recent Earth studies (aimed at weakening the UPEC antioxidant defense) to control UPEC infections would prove useful also in space flights. Further, EcAMSat results should clarify inconsistencies from previous space experiments on bacterial antibiotic sensitivity and other issues.” The manuscript may be consulted for further details and all the relevant references; see Bibliography section in 2017 report.     <P>
In addition, the work has brought to light issues, such as the stress exerted by the flight equipment on bacteria, which we are now in the process of elucidating and ameliorating for the development of better future platforms for spaceflight experimentation on bacterial biology, resistance, and virulence. <P></td>

						This project is concerned with the design, development, and testing of a nanosatellite payload, and the proposed biological experiment in spaceflight, which was launched in late 2017. Prior to the flight, the NASA and Stanford teams worked closely to develop the hardware and microfluidics to make the space experiment possible. A paper was published in 2017: "Payload hardware and experimental protocol for testing the effect of space microgravity on the resistance to gentamicin of stationary-phase uropathogenic Escherichia coli and its Sigma S-deficient mutant." Life Sciences in Space Research 15: 1-10 (2017); the Journal chose this paper for highlighting. The flight itself was a phenomenal success.     <P>
The launch was flawless, the experimental ingredients 'fired' on time and in perfect intended succession, and the extremely effective transfer of data via telemetry permitted the experiment to proceed for longer than was hoped. The results have been nearly completely analyzed, and a second paper dealing with the biological results is at penultimate stage of submission. A third paper dealing with the technical aspects of the successful flight and experimental protocol is in preparation.  Thus, in addition to the publications reported in previous periods, three additional ones have (or shortly will have) results.        <P>
The biological results have unequivocally confirmed the underlying hypothesis of the project, namely, that the rpoS gene (which encodes a sigma factor called Sigma S) does indeed control bacterial resistance to antibiotics both here on Earth and in space. Given the extremely dangerous problem faced by contemporary public health, that of widespread resistance of bacteria to antibiotics in general, we have conducted virtual screening of the Zinc data base of small compounds (over 101,000 compounds) and have identified several candidates whose free binding energies and other attributes promise to antagonize RpoS activity, based on its tertiary structure. Compounds doing the same for two of the proteins whose synthesis this sigma factor controls is in progress; multiple means of targeting the susceptible aspects of microbial antibiotic defense is necessary to prevent resistance development. Thus, we have confirmed the hypothesis that underpinned this project and have progressed to designing countermeasures; this is in progress. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> 	This project has accomplished one of its two milestones, and the updated summary provided now reflects not only the conceptual genesis of the project, but also as it was refined as the project progressed. While, of course, the original essence remains, what is presented here is the summit of the first milestone, and precedes previous reports. This milestone is concerned with Earth studies to develop and rigorously test the technology for determining the sensitivity of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) during spaceflight, and to elucidate the genetic basis of whatever change is seen. The second milestone is experimentation during the spaceflight itself, for which we are now fully poised; the flight is expected to occur in the middle of this year.     <P>
	A paper entitled: “Payload hardware and experimental protocol development to enable future testing of the effect of space microgravity on the resistance to gentamicin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and its (sigma)s-deficient mutant,” was published very recently (available online May 2017): Life Sciences in Space Research 15 (2017) 1–10 2214-5524/ © 2017 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Published by Elsevier Ltd.; [( <a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lssr.2017.05.001</a>  )] As has been pointed out before, this project represents highly collaborative and collegial collaboration between Stanford and NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. The published paper reflects this not only by the joint authorship of it by both Stanford and Moffett Field scientists, but also the benefits that accrue from collaboration between biological expertise (Stanford) and the flight technological expertise (Moffett Field).    <P>

	The abstract of this paper, reproduced here (in quotes), succinctly describes the evolved conceptual background, and demonstrates in detail the development of the EcAMSat platform, and its thorough testing using space-flight-like commands.     <P>
	“Human immune response is compromised and bacteria can become more antibiotic resistant in space microgravity (MG). We report that under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), stationary-phase uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) become more resistant to gentamicin (Gm), and that this increase is dependent on the presence of s (a transcription regulator encoded by the rpoS gene). UPEC causes urinary tract infections (UTIs), reported to afflict astronauts; Gm is a standard treatment, so these findings could impact astronaut health. Because LSMMG findings can differ from MG, we report preparations to examine UPEC’s Gm sensitivity during spaceflight using the E. coli Anti-Microbial Satellite (EcAMSat) on a free-flying “nanosatellite” in low Earth orbit. Within EcAMSat’s payload, a 48-microwell fluidic card contains and supports study of bacterial cultures at constant temperature; optical absorbance changes in cell suspensions were made at three wavelengths for each microwell and a fluid-delivery system provided growth medium and predefined Gm concentrations. Performance characterization is reported here for spaceflight prototypes of this payload system. Using conventional microtiter plates, we show that Alamar Blue (AB) absorbance changes can assess the Gm effect on E. coli viability, permitting telemetric transfer of the spaceflight data to Earth. Laboratory results using payload prototypes are consistent with wellplate and flask findings of differential sensitivity of UPEC and its delta rpoS strain to Gm. if (sigma)s plays the same role in space MG as in LSMMG and Earth gravity, countermeasures discovered in recent Earth studies (aimed at weakening the UPEC antioxidant defense) to control UPEC infections would prove useful also in space flights. Further, EcAMSat results should clarify inconsistencies from previous space experiments on bacterial antibiotic sensitivity and other issues.” The manuscript may be consulted for further details and all the relevant references.    <P>
	In addition, the work has brought to light issues, such as the stress exerted by the flight equipment on bacteria, that we are now in the process of elucidating and ameliorating for the development of better future platforms for spaceflight experimentation on bacterial biology, resistance, and virulence. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is becoming an extremely serious problem on Earth that will impact space travellers as well (the astronauts carry with them the Earth microflora). The research underway will provide a critical test for a hypothesis that, if confirmed, will show the way to greatly mitigate bacterial resistance to antibiotics in general. This hypothesis is based on a firm foundation provided by experiments conducted on Earth; since bacterial resistance increases under microgravity conditions, its testing in space provides an amplified situation where the difference made by the absence of the gene responsible can be seen more clearly.    <P>
The innovative technology that is being development is generation of small molecules that can silence the rpoS gene, and selected proteins of the UPEC antioxidant defense, controlled by this gene. These will enhance Gm effectiveness against UPEC and thus benefit space travelers.    <P></td>

						Increased bacterial resistance in spaceflights has been reported; also weakening of human immune response takes place under space microgravity. Urinary tract infections often occur in astronauts; the uropathogenic strain of E. coli (UPEC) is a causative agent of this disease, and the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) is its standard treatment. The EcAMSat platform that we have developed will permit definitive determination of the degree of increase in UPEC resistance to Gm in spaceflight and the UPEC proteins involved in any such increase. This will permit developing drugs that will enhance Gm effectiveness against UPEC and provide protection to astronauts. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This project is concerned with the design, development, and testing of a nanosatellite payload, and the proposed biological experiment during spaceflight. The flight is now scheduled later in 2016.     <P>
As in the past, the NASA and Stanford teams have worked closely on this project period to optimize the experimental conditions and ensure the success of the experiment in space.     <P>
Astronauts during spaceflight are susceptible to bacterial infections; this is because microgravity of space compromises human immune system and as learned mostly by experiments conducted in microgravity simulation on Earth, it also makes bacteria more resistant to antibiotics. The EcAMSat experiment focuses on directly documenting alterations in antibiotic resistance in the space environment using a well-defined microbial system -- the bacterium, E. coli, and a widely-used antibiotic, gentamicin, against a uropathogenic strain of this bacterium. Fully autonomous microsystems like EcAMSat reduce the cost and obviate other limitations of human-tended space biological experiments.    <P>
The Matin group has shown in Earth experiments, using simulated microgravity systems, that the increase in bacterial antibiotic resistance depends on their intact innate resistance, which is under the control of a master regulator gene called rpoS (3). Our recent findings have identified several proteins controlled by this gene that determine E. coli resistance to gentamicin (4). Future work to assess the role of these genes in space can be expected to provide further novel means of countering bacterial resistance in space.    <P>
EcAMSat’s 14 kg mass comprises provides state of the art technology to conduct preplanned experiments in space, e.g., a triple-junction solar cells, the experiment containment vessel, payload electronics subsystems, and bidirectional communication using a commercial WiFi-technology radio. Thus, experiments can be conducted during spaceflight and the bacterial sensitivity to the antibiotic in microgravity can be determined and transmitted to Earth. The experiments will determine if the rpoS gene is important to increased gentamicin resistance of E. coli in microgravity. If proven, countermeasures can be devised against this gene for the safety of astronauts.    <P>
The work so far has completed preparations for spaceflight, i.e., equipment and experimental protocol have been finalized for the spaceflight. As soon as the flight is arranged, the microgravity research will begin. A paper reporting this accomplishment will be submitted for publication within a week or two.    <P>
During the flight the data transmitted to Earth via WiFi will be analyzed by the Stanford and NASA groups; they will be interpreted in the light of several control experiments that have been done both at Stanford and at Moffett Field.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is becoming an extremely serious problem on Earth that will impact space travellers as well (the astronauts carry with them the Earth microflora). The research underway will provide a critical test for a hypothesis, which if confirmed, will show the way to greatly mitigate bacterial resistance to antibiotics in general. This hypothesis is based on a firm foundation provided by experiments conducted on Earth; since bacterial resistance increases under microgravity conditions, its testing in space provides an amplified situation where the difference made by the absence of the gene responsible can be seen more clearly.    <P>
The innovative technology that is being developed is a generation of small molecules that can silence the gene in question, which can then either be used alone (since the resulting weakened bacteria can be more easily dealt with by the immune system) or in combination with existing antibiotics for effective treatment of infectious disease here on Earth as well as in space. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This project is concerned with the design, development, and testing of a nanosatellite payload, and the proposed biological experiment after launch in 2013. As in the past, the NASA and Stanford teams have worked closely in this project period to optimize the experimental conditions and ensure the success of the experiment in space. This includes weekly conference calls, visits by the parties to each other’s institutions, and regular discussion in more formal setting in the presence of other NASA staff. The two component personnel have enjoyed a close, pleasant, and productive interactive relationship.    <P>
As dramatized in the movie Apollo 13, astronauts during spaceflight can contract bacterial infections.  Astronauts in space have also experienced infections with other opportunistic and pathogenic microbes. Effective treatment of bacterial infections has required therapy customized for the space environment, as evidence has accumulated that microbes respond differently to antimicrobials in the space environment (1). The EcAMSat experiment focuses on directly documenting alterations in antibiotic resistance in the space environment using a well-defined microbial system - the bacterium, E. coli, and a widely-used antibiotic, gentamicin, against a uropathogenic strain of this bacterium.    <P>
Integrated bioreactors have flown on manned spacecraft; they require humans to initiate experiments, record data, and collect or prepare samples to return them to Earth for characterization. Fully autonomous microsystems like EcAMSat reduce the cost and obviate other limitations of human-tended space biological experiments, while expanding significantly the number of launch opportunities.    <P>
The Matin group has shown in Earth experiments that bacterial antibiotic resistance depends on their intact innate resistance, whose central regulator is the stress sigma factor, Sigma S (ss). Further, our studies with simulated microgravity obtained using high aspect ratio (HARV) bioreactors, have shown that in stationary phase, the bacterial antibiotic resistance is greatly enhanced, again dependent on this sigma factor (encoded by the rpoS gene) (3). Our recent findings have identified several proteins controlled by this sigma factor that determine E. coli resistance to gentamicin (4). Future work to assess the role of these genes in space can be expected to provide further novel means of countering bacterial resistance in space.    <P>
EcAMSat’s 14 kg mass comprises a structure roughly 10 x 22 x 34 cm, including triple-junction solar cells; patch antenna for 2.4-GHz bidirectional communication using a commercial WiFi-technology radio; self-deploying omnidirectional “beacon” antenna for spacecraft location and education-and-outreach broadcasting on the amateur (“ham”) band (437.465 MHz); mechanical structure; spacecraft power/processor/communications/control system (collectively, the “bus”); and the experiment containment vessel, internal volume 1.2 L, which houses the bio/fluidic, opti-cal, thermal, sensor, and payload electronics subsystems. Magnetic rods passively orient the satellite, aiming the spacecraft’s long axis and hence the patch antenna towards Earth’s north magnetic pole during the part of each ~93-minute orbital period when the spacecraft is above the northern hemisphere. Magnetic hysteresis rods damp nutation or “wobble” in spacecraft motion by dissipating energy as heat when they move across Earth’s magnetic field lines.    <P>
The EcAMSat fluidic system includes forty-eight 100-µL culture wells, each 4 mm in diameter x 7.8 mm deep. Use of 9-mm pitch along the rows and 9- and 13.5-mm center-to-center row spacing allows fluidic card optical analysis with standard multiwell plate readers. The fluidic card was fabricated by Micronics, Inc. from laser-cut poly(methylmethacrylate) layers laminated to one another using pressure-sensitive acrylic adhesive interlayers supported on PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) carrier films. Four independent sets of manifolded fluidic inlets and outlets supply nutrients and antibiotic agent to the four 12-well banks. Bacterial cells are confined in the microwells by integral 0.2-µm pore-size nylon fiber membrane filters (Sterlitech). The NASA group with Stanford participation and input has continued to develop and test the nanosatellite payload, including the biological experiment that will test the hypothesis that stress response to the spaceflight microgravity environment enhances antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in a manner dependent on its stress transcriptional factor, ss. Based on the results, a protocol has been developed for the space experiments.    <P>
The pressure values for introducing various fluids into microwells is nearly optimized and the full protocol will begin to be tested on Earth in the next few weeks. Also, a standard curve for survival of starving experimental bacteria is being determined to fend for unforeseen alteration in the stowage period before the commencement of the flight. Similarly, preparations are being made for parallel control experiments on Earth during the spaceflight.    <P>
EcAMSat’s “2U” payload will support wild-type UPEC and its isogenic rpoS mutant (lacking sS, which is encoded by the rpoS gene) in four independent banks of 12 100-µL wells (6 wells each for wild-type and mutant) in a microfluidic card that delivers nutrient, confines cells using integral 0.2-µm-pore filters, and maintains temperature (37°C). Each microwell (pathlength: 8 mm) has a dedicated 3-color LED and photodetector to track growth of the organisms via light scattering (470 nm). Cellular metabolism is tracked using Alamar Blue indicator dye (615 nm) and its reduced form (525 nm), generated by bacterial metabolism.    <P>
Growth and metabolism of E. coli are measured versus the concentration of the antibiotic gentamicin (four well banks provide three concentrations and a control). Following orbital stabilization, bacteria in stasis are given nutrient and grown to stationary phase, the phase most important in disease causation. The bacteria are then rinsed with nutrient-free buffer and starved for 24 hr (to firm up the innate resistance of stationary phase cells). Finally, they are treated with gentamicin for 24 hours, followed by tracking survival dynamically via Alamar Blue. We have performed detailed baseline and feasibility experiments, showing that Alamar Blue measurements reliably indicate the increased sensitivity of the mutant to gentamicin.    <P>
As stated above, the rationale of the project is based on the fact that there is convincing evidence that microgravity (MG) increases bacterial resistance and weakens the human immune response, which necessitates careful examination of bacterial threat to astronauts in spaceflight. We previously discovered, using simulated microgravity [called low shear simulated microgravity (LSMMG)], using the high aspect to volume (HARV) bioreactors, that the resistance of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) increases under these conditions, and this increase is dependent on a gene called rpoS. This bacterium causes cystitis, incidence of which has been reported in astronauts; Gm is used to treat this disease.    <P>
NNX10AM90A (“EcAMSat”) is aimed at testing, under actual MG of spaceflight, the validity of the above findings. This is a collaborative effort between Stanford and NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. If confirmed in space experiments, the results would indicate effective countermeasures to enhance the safety of space travel.    <P>
Our teams –at Stanford and at Moffett Field - have achieved notable success. First, we have established a completely reliable system for monitoring changes in UPEC activity by a color reaction that can be used to beam real time data from space (in this case from a nanosatellite) via telemetry. These experiments were done at Stanford using microtiter plate wells. Cells were grown to stationary phase, starved (which is necessary to activate the stress response, and is a condition bacteria often experience in disease causation process), then diluted to an A660  of 0.45 in M9 salts (a kind of buffer) with the addition of 16 µg/mL gentamicin (Gm), incubated at 37C for 24 hours, after which they were dispensed in microtiter plate wells and Alamar Blue (AB) was added to interrogate the system for viability – the viability in this system is shown by the extent of the conversion of AB from blue to pink color. Controls without the drug etc. were included. The results clearly showed that Gm addition has much less lethal effect on the wild type than on the mutant; this was evident both from the remaining blue color in the plate wells, and the corresponding increase in red color, as well as the graphic representation of the color changes. Thus the loss of the gene that is missing from the mutant (rpoS) makes it more sensitive to the drug, and this can be documented by the differing loss of the capacity to convert AB from blue to pink).    <P>
A lot of work was needed to adapt the payload apparatus to work with bacteria, the beginning point being the PharmaSat hardware that was used for space experiments with Yeast. Filters needed to be changed, biocompatibility, cell escape issues, fluidics timing, and pumping to accommodate the new fluid flow characteristics, all needed to be addressed and now meet the engineering requirements. A number of tests including certain experimental verification tests (EVTs) have been run, and it is confirmed in preliminary experiments that the hardware can track cell activity by permitting monitoring of AB color change.    <P>
The outcome is that the system as a whole has now begun to work and is now ready to be optimized. One major issue is to determine the amount of pressure that can be used during fluid exchanges (such as exchanging the growth medium with the antibiotic) without causing cells to be swept out in large numbers from the suspension on to the filters. This and related aspects are now being addressed. We are confident that these efforts will shortly provide a new hardware system that would be generically capable of experiments with bacteria in spaceflights.       <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is becoming an extremely serious problem on Earth that will impact space travellers as well (the astronauts carry with them the Earth microflora). The research underway will provide a critical test for a hypothesis, which if confirmed, will show the way to greatly mitigate bacterial resistance to antibiotics in general. This hypothesis is based on a firm foundation provided by experiments conducted on Earth; and since bacterial resistance increases under microgravity conditions, its testing in space provides an amplified situation where the difference made by the absence of the gene responsible can be seen more clearly.    <P>
The innovative technology that is being developed is a generation of small molecules that can silence the gene in question, which can then either be used alone (since the resulting weakened bacteria can be more easily dealt with by the immune system) or in combination with existing antibiotics for effective treatment of infectious disease here on Earth as well as in space. <P></td>

						As explained in previous reports the EcAMSat project is based on the hypothesis that UPEC resistance to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) will become greater under space microgravity, and its dependence on the stress sigma factor, Sigma S, will become more marked under these conditions. The importance of exploring this phenomenon lies both for space travel as well as for life on Earth. Bacterial antibiotic resistance has become a very serious overall public health threat and this development is particularly hazardous for astronauts for two reasons: their immune system is weakened and bacteria become more resistant to disinfectant agents, including antibiotics, under microgravity conditions.     <P>
The Sigma S hypothesis is supported by our finding in low-shear modeled microgravity. We have recently published an extensive analysis of the mechanism involved (see the link:  <a target="_blank" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~amatin/MatinLabHomePage/PDF/SigS_Gm_ms.pdf">http://web.stanford.edu/~amatin/MatinLabHomePage/PDF/SigS_Gm_ms.pdf</a>  ).    <P>
To summarize the critical finding: bacteria protect themselves against antibiotics of different classes using their antioxidant defense machinery. The current efforts to overcome bacterial resistance are antibiotic-specific; thus for instance, a measure taken to overcome bacterial resistance to ß-lactams is to neutralize ß-lactamase that resistant bacteria produce. Our discovery of the involvement of antioxidant defense in bacterial antibiotic resistance means that an overall way to enhance the efficacy of antibiotics against bacteria is to compromise their antioxidant defense machinery. This can be done by discovering small molecule compounds that can inhibit the proteins of this defense that we have implicated in bacterial antibiotic resistance.    <P>
In order to be able to determine if the Sigma S hypothesis is valid under the conditions of actual microgravity, this project will perform experiments aboard a small satellite using the Gm. A way has to be found of determining the effect of Gm on bacterial activity in a way that could be beamed from space to Earth via telemetry. We have perfected this method at Stanford by using Alamar Blue to measure bacterial metabolic activity. The speed of color change from blue to magenta of this dye indicates bacterial viability, and we successfully showed that this color change accurately duplicates the results of plate counts in showing that the wild type is more resistant to Gm than its isogenic mutant missing Sigma S. More recently, we have been attempting to show that this can be done in the space hardware as well. Recent results have given promise, and more tests are in progress; we believe that the experimental system would be ready to fly very shortly.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This project is concerned with the design, development, and testing of a nanosatellite payload, and the proposed biological experiment after launch in 2013. As in the past, the NASA and Stanford teams have worked closely in this project period to optimize the experimental conditions and ensure the success of the experiment in space. This includes weekly conference calls, visits by the parties to each other’s institutions, and regular discussion in more formal setting in the presence of other NASA staff. The two component personnel have enjoyed a close, pleasant, and productive interactive relationship.    <P>
As dramatized in the movie Apollo 13, astronauts during spaceflight can contract bacterial infections.  Astronauts in space have also experienced infections with other opportunistic and pathogenic microbes. Effective treatment of bacterial infections has required therapy customized for the space environment, as evidence has accumulated that microbes respond differently to antimicrobials in the space environment (1). The EcAMSat experiment focus on directly documenting alterations in antibiotic resistance in the space environment using a well-defined microbial system - the bacterium, E. coli, and a widely-used antibiotic, gentamicin, against a uropathogenic strain of this bacterium.    <P>
Integrated bioreactors have flown on manned spacecraft; they require humans to initiate experiments, record data, and collect or prepare samples to return them to Earth for characterization. Fully autonomous microsystems like EcAMSat reduce the cost and obviate other limitations of human-tended space biological experiments, while expanding significantly the number of launch opportunities.    <P>
The Matin group has shown in Earth experiments that bacterial antibiotic resistance depends on their intact innate resistance, whose central regulator is the stress sigma factor, Sigma S (ss). Further, our studies with simulated microgravity obtained using high aspect ratio (HARV) bioreactors, have shown that in stationary phase, the bacterial antibiotic resistance is greatly enhanced, again dependent on this sigma factor (encoded by the rpoS gene) (3). Our recent findings have identified several proteins controlled by this sigma factor that determine E. coli resistance to gentamicin (4). Future work to assess the role of these genes in space can be expected to provide further novel means of countering bacterial resistance in space.    <P>
EcAMSat’s 14 kg mass comprises a structure roughly 10 x 22 x 34 cm, including triple-junction solar cells; patch antenna for 2.4-GHz bidirectional communication using a commercial WiFi-technology radio; self-deploying omnidirectional “beacon” antenna for spacecraft location and education-and-outreach broadcasting on the amateur (“ham”) band (437.465 MHz); mechanical structure; spacecraft power/processor/communications/control system (collectively, the “bus”); and the experiment containment vessel, internal volume 1.2 L, which houses the bio/fluidic, opti-cal, thermal, sensor, and payload electronics subsystems. Magnetic rods passively orient the satellite, aiming the spacecraft’s long axis and hence the patch antenna towards Earth’s north magnetic pole during the part of each ~93-minute orbital period when the spacecraft is above the northern hemisphere. Magnetic hysteresis rods damp nutation or “wobble” in spacecraft motion by dissipating energy as heat when they move across Earth’s magnetic field lines.    <P>
The EcAMSat fluidic system includes forty-eight 100-µL culture wells, each 4 mm in diameter x 7.8 mm deep. Use of 9-mm pitch along the rows and 9- and 13.5-mm center-to-center row spacing allows fluidic card optical analysis with standard multiwell plate readers. The fluidic card was fabricated by Micronics, Inc. from laser-cut poly(methylmethacrylate) layers laminated to one another using pressure-sensitive acrylic adhesive interlayers supported on PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) carrier films. Four independent sets of manifolded fluidic inlets and outlets supply nutrients and antibiotic agent to the four 12-well banks. Bacterial cells are confined in the microwells by integral 0.2-µm pore-size nylon fiber membrane filters (Sterlitech). The NASA group with Stanford participation and input has continued to develop and test the nanosatellite payload, including the biological experiment that will test the hypothesis that stress response to the spaceflight microgravity environment enhances antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in a manner dependent on its stress transcriptional factor, ss. Based on the results, a protocol has been developed for the space experiments.    <P>
The pressure values for introducing various fluids into microwells is nearly optimized and the full protocol will begin to be tested on Earth in the next few weeks. Also, a standard curve for survival of starving experimental bacteria is being determined to fend for unforeseen alteration in the stowage period before the commencement of the flight. Similarly, preparations are being made for parallel control experiments on Earth during the space flight.    <P>
EcAMSat’s “2U” payload will support wild-type UPEC and its isogenic rpoS mutant (lacking sS, which is encoded by the rpoS gene) in four independent banks of 12 100-µL wells (6 wells each for wild-type and mutant) in a microfluidic card that delivers nutrient, confines cells using integral 0.2-µm-pore filters, and maintains temperature (37 °C). Each microwell (pathlength: 8 mm) has a dedicated 3-color LED and photodetector to track growth of the organisms via light scattering (470 nm). Cellular metabolism is tracked using Alamar Blue indicator dye (615 nm) and its reduced form (525 nm), generated by bacterial metabolism.    <P>
Growth and metabolism of E. coli are measured versus the concentration of the antibiotic gentamicin (four well banks provide three concentrations and a control). Following orbital stabilization, bacteria in stasis are given nutrient and grown to stationary phase, the phase most important in disease causation. The bacteria are then rinsed with nutrient-free buffer and starved for 24 hr (to firm up the innate resistance of stationary phase cells). Finally, they are treated with gentamicin for 24 hours, followed by tracking survival dynamically via Alamar Blue. We have performed detailed baseline and feasibility experiments, showing that Alamar Blue measurements reliably indicate the increased sensitivity of the mutant to gentamicin.    <P>
As stated above, the rationale of the project is based on the fact that there is convincing evidence that microgravity (MG) increases bacterial resistance and weakens the human immune response, which necessitates careful examination of bacterial threat to astronauts in space flight. We previously discovered, using simulated microgravity [called low shear simulated microgravity (LSMMG)], using the high aspect to volume (HARV) bioreactors, that the resistance of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) to the antibiotic gentamicin (Gm) increases under these conditions, and this increase is dependent on a gene called rpoS. This bacterium causes cystitis, incidence of which has been reported in astronauts; Gm is used to treat this disease.    <P>
NNX10AM90A (“EcAMSat”) is aimed at testing, under actual MG of space flight, the validity of the above findings. This is a collaborative effort between Stanford and NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. If confirmed in space experiments, the results would indicate effective countermeasures to enhance the safety of space travel.    <P>
Our teams –at Stanford and at Moffett Field - have achieved notable success. First, we have established a completely reliable system for monitoring changes in UPEC activity by a color reaction that can be used to beam real time data from space (in this case from a nanosatellite) via telemetry. These experiments were done at Stanford using microtiter plate wells. Cells were grown to stationary phase, starved (which is necessary to activate the stress response, and is a condition bacteria often experience in disease causation process), then diluted to an A660  of 0.45 in M9 salts (a kind of buffer) with the addition of 16 µg/mL gentamicin (Gm), incubated at 37C for 24 hours, after which they were dispensed in microtiter plate wells and Alamar Blue (AB) was added to interrogate the system for viability – the viability in this system is shown by the extent of the conversion of AB from blue to pink color. Controls without the drug etc. were included. The results clearly showed that Gm addition has much less lethal effect on the wild type than on the mutant; this was evident both from the remaining blue color in the plate wells, and the corresponding increase in red color, as well as the graphic representation of the color changes. Thus the loss of the gene that is missing from the mutant (rpoS) makes it more sensitive to the drug, and this can be documented by the differing loss of the capacity to convert AB from blue to pink).    <P>
A lot of work was needed to adapt the payload apparatus to work with bacteria, the beginning point being the PharmaSat hardware that was used for space experiments with Yeast. Filters needed to be changed, biocompatibility, cell escape issues, fluidics timing, and pumping to accommodate the new fluid flow characteristics, all needed to be addressed and now meet the engineering requirements. A number of tests including certain experimental verification tests (EVTs) have been run, and it is confirmed in preliminary experiments that the hardware can track cell activity by permitting monitoring of AB color change.    <P>
The outcome is that the system as a whole has now begun to work and is now ready to be optimized. One major issue is to determine the amount of pressure that can be used during fluid exchanges (such as exchanging the growth medium with the antibiotic) without causing cells to be swept out in large numbers from the suspension on to the filters. This and related aspects are now being addressed. We are confident that these efforts will shortly provide a new hardware system that would be generically capable of experiments with bacteria in space flights.       <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is becoming an extremely serious problem on Earth which will impact space travellers as well (the astronauts carry with them the Earth microflora). The research underway will provide a critical test for a hypothesis, which if confirmed, will show the way to greatly mitigate bacterial resistance to antibiotics in general. This hypothesis is based on a firm foundation provided by experiments conducted on Earth; and since bacterial resistance increases under microgravity conditions, its testing in space provides an amplified situation where the difference made by the absence of the gene responsible can be seen more clearly.    <P>
The innovative technology that is being developed is a generation of small molecules that can silence the gene in question, which can then either be used alone (since the resulting weakened bacteria can be more easily dealt with by the immune system) or in combination with existing antibiotics for effective treatment of infectious disease here on Earth as well as in space. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This project is concerned with the design, development, and testing of a nanosatellite payload, and the proposed biological experiment after launch in 2013. As in the past, the NASA and Stanford teams have worked closely in this project period to optimize the experimental conditions and ensure the success of the experiment in space. This includes weekly conference calls, visits by the parties to each other’s institutions, and regular discussion in more formal setting in the presence of other NASA staff. The two component personnel have enjoyed a close, pleasant and productive interactive relationship.    <P>
As dramatized in the movie Apollo 13, astronauts during spaceflight can contract bacterial infections.  Astronauts in space have also experienced infections with other opportunistic and pathogenic microbes. Effective treatment of bacterial infections has required therapy customized for the space environment, as evidence has accumulated that microbes respond differently to antimicrobials in the space environment (1). The EcAMSat experiment focus on directly documenting alterations in antibiotic resistance in the space environment using a well-defined microbial system - the bacterium, E. coli, and a widely-used antibiotic, gentamicin, against a uropathogenic strain of this bacterium.    <P>
Integrated bioreactors have flown on manned spacecraft; they require humans to initiate experiments, record data, and collect or prepare samples to return them to Earth for characterization. Fully autonomous microsystems like EcAMSat reduce the cost and obviate other limitations of human-tended space biological experiments, while expanding significantly the number of launch opportunities (2).    <P>
The Matin group has shown in Earth experiments that bacterial antibiotic resistance depends on their intact innate resistance, whose central regulator is the stress sigma factor, Sigma S (ss). Further, our studies with simulated microgravity obtained using high aspect ratio (HARV) bioreactors, have shown that in stationary phase, the bacterial antibiotic resistance is greatly enhanced, again dependent on this sigma factor (encoded by the rpoS gene) (3). Our recent findings have identified several proteins controlled by this sigma factor that determine E. coli resistance to gentamicin (4). Future work to assess the role of these genes in space can be expected to provide further novel means of countering bacterial resistance in space.    <P>
EcAMSat’s 14 kg mass comprises a structure roughly 10 x 22 x 34 cm, including triple-junction solar cells; patch antenna for 2.4-GHz bidirectional communication using a commercial WiFi-technology radio; self-deploying omnidirectional “beacon” antenna for spacecraft location and education-and-outreach broadcasting on the amateur (“ham”) band (437.465 MHz); mechanical structure; spacecraft power/processor/communications/control system (collectively, the “bus”); and the experiment containment vessel, internal volume 1.2 L, which houses the bio/fluidic, opti-cal, thermal, sensor, and payload electronics subsystems. Magnetic rods passively orient the satellite, aiming the spacecraft’s long axis and hence the patch antenna towards Earth’s north magnetic pole during the part of each ~93-minute orbital period when the spacecraft is above the northern hemisphere. Magnetic hysteresis rods damp nutation or “wobble” in spacecraft motion by dissipating energy as heat when they move across Earth’s magnetic field lines.    <P>
The EcAMSat fluidic system includes forty-eight 100-µL culture wells, each 4 mm in diameter x 7.8 mm deep. Use of 9-mm pitch along the rows and 9- and 13.5-mm center-to-center row spacing allows fluidic card optical analysis with standard multiwell plate readers. The fluidic card was fabricated by Micronics, Inc. from laser-cut poly(methylmethacrylate) layers laminated to one another using pressure-sensitive acrylic adhesive interlayers supported on PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)) carrier films. Four independent sets of manifolded fluidic inlets and outlets supply nutrients and antibiotic agent to the four 12-well banks. Bacterial cells are confined in the microwells by integral 0.2-µm pore-size nylon fiber membrane filters (Sterlitech). The NASA group with Stanford participation and input has continued to develop and test the nanosatellite payload, including the biological experiment that will test the hypothesis that stress response to the spaceflight microgravity environment enhances antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in a manner dependent on its stress transcriptional factor, ss. Based on the results, a protocol has been developed for the space experiments.    <P>
The pressure values for introducing various fluids into microwells is nearly optimized and the full protocol will begin to be tested on Earth in the next few weeks. Also, a standard curve for survival of starving experimental bacteria is being determined to fend for unforeseen alteration in the stowage period before the commencement of the flight. Similarly, preparations are being made for parallel control experiments on Earth during the space flight.    <P>
EcAMSat’s “2U” payload will support wild-type UPEC and its isogenic rpoS mutant (lacking sS, which is encoded by the rpoS gene) in four independent banks of 12 100-µL wells (6 wells each for wild-type and mutant) in a microfluidic card that delivers nutrient, confines cells using integral 0.2-µm-pore filters, and maintains temperature (37 °C). Each microwell (pathlength: 8 mm) has a dedicated 3-color LED and photodetector to track growth of the organisms via light scattering (470 nm). Cellular metabolism is tracked using Alamar Blue indicator dye (615 nm) and its reduced form (525 nm), generated by bacterial metabolism.    <P>
Growth and metabolism of E. coli are measured versus the concentration of the antibiotic gentamicin (four well banks provide three concentrations and a control). Following orbital stabilization, bacteria in stasis are given nutrient and grown to stationary phase, the phase most important in disease causation. The bacteria are then rinsed with nutrient-free buffer and starved for 24 hr (to firm up the innate resistance of stationary phase cells). Finally, they are treated with gentamicin for 24 hours, followed by tracking survival dynamically via Alamar Blue. We have performed detailed baseline and feasibility experiments, showing that Alamar Blue measurements reliably indicate the increased sensitivity of the mutant to gentamicin.     <P>

The research underway will provide a critical test for a hypothesis, which if confirmed, will show the way to greatly mitigate bacterial resistance to antibiotics in general. This hypothesis is based on a firm foundation provided by experiments conducted on Earth; and since bacterial resistance increases under microgravity conditions, its testing in space provides an amplified situation where the difference made by the absence of the gene responsible can be seen more clearly.    <P>
The innovative technology that is being developed is a generation of small molecules that can silence the gene in question, which can then either be used alone (since the resulting weakened bacteria can be more easily dealt with by the immune system) or in combination with existing antibiotics for effective treatment of infectious disease here on Earth as well as in space. <P></td>

• Gentamicin retains 50% potency; load concentration will take this into account.    <P>
• Bacterial viability (M9 salts); 70 day stowage: WT, 0.7%; Sigma S mutant, 0.3%.    <P>
• As the desired starting inoculum is ±1.2x108 cells/ml, the load concentration will be around 1.7x1010 and 4x1010/ml for the wt & the mutant respectively.    <P>
• Alamar Blue potency is unaffected.    <P>

1. Add 1/8th potency LB to initiate growth.    <P>
2. After 12 h (final A600 : ca. 0.5), wash in M9.    <P>
3. Starve in M9 for 24 h (to induce innate resistance).    <P>
4. Add gentamicin (aged antibiotic to equal three concentrations around 16 µg/ml).    <P>

The urinary tract pathogen, Escherichia coli (UPEC), and the antibiotic gentamycin will be studied. The hypotheses will be tested by determining gentamycin resistance of UPEC, and its mutant missing sigma S, during spaceflight using the existing PharmaSat bus and microfluidics system and comparing it to Earth-based 1g ground controls. Parallel LSMMG Earth HARV controls will test the reliability of HARVs in reproducing SM conditions; this validation is important because HARVs afford a convenient system to study SM effects on biological entities on Earth. The PI and others using LSMMG conditions, have shown that LSMMG greatly increases bacterial resistance to antimicrobials and weakens the human immune response. Thus, for the safety of astronaut health, it is important to determine the effect of actual microgravity on bacterial antibiotic resistance; likewise an understanding of its genetic basis is important to design countermeasures. <P></td>

This hypothesis is based on a firm foundation provided by experiments conducted on Earth; and since bacterial resistance increases under microgravity conditions, its testing in space provides an amplified situation where the difference made by the absence of the gene responsible can be seen more clearly.    <P>
The innovative technology that we expect to develop is generation of small molecules that can silence the gene in question, which can then either be used alone (since the resulting weakened bacteria can be more easily dealt with by the immune system) or in combination with existing antibiotics for effective treatment of infectious disease here on Earth as well as in space. <P></td>

						In this period, we worked on implementing the protocol developed in Phase A of the project (see year one report) in the actual system that will be used in the space experiments. This is of course highly important because ordinary laboratory conditions are not necessarily predictive of bacterial activity, antibiotic effectiveness, etc. under the specialized conditions obtaining in the equipment that is used in actual space flights. The Stanford and the Ames teams worked closely to tackle the issues that arose.     <P>
To give the conclusion first: Because the system (PharmaSat) was developed for experiments with yeast, which are much bigger than bacteria, we were not surprised that difficulties were encountered. However, we have now fully overcome the problems and in the process have developed articles of equipment and procedures that will important also in future experiments with bacteria in space.    <P>
The first question was whether the material to be used in space (especially the chamber for the conducting of the experiment, called the fluidic card) would permit survival of bacteria, etc. -- in other words, whether it would prove to be "biocompatible". No problems were encountered on this issue.    <P>
However, when the system testing progressed to using the above chamber (the fluidic card) together with the fluid delivery system, problems arose. The success of the experiment requires that the sub-chambers (the "wells") within the fluidic card keep the bacterial cells separated. But we found that this did not happen and the bacterial cells escaped from one well to another.      <P>
This could have resulted due to several factors and we checked them one by one in the order of the most likely cause. The most likely possibility was that some ingredient in the suspending medium (the "M9" solution) reacted with the glue, separating the wells, and damaging it to the point as to permit the bacterial escape. Chloride ion appeared to be the most likely culprit in this respect. However, elimination of NaCl from M9 did not solve the problem. We then tried several other solutions (phosphate buffer with no added salts, MOPS buffer, PBS buffer, and water by itself). While all of these permitted the requisite bacterial survival, only the use of water overcame the problem of bacterial escape from the fluidic card wells. And now another unexpected result was found. Whereas suspending the bacterial cells in water permitted their requisite interval of survival when laboratory vessels were used, this did not happen in the fluidic card. So clearly this avenue of solving the problem had to be abandoned.     <P>
Since as regards survival the new suspending milieus tested worked as well as M9, it was decided to persist with this suspension solution given the long-term experience of the PI with this system and the fact that the agreed upon experimental protocol of Phase A relied on the use of this suspension milieu. We therefore explored other avenues to solve the problem of escape.    <P>
The next idea we tested was that it was the bacteria themselves that may have been the culprit. The test bacterium E. coli has a 'voluminous' appetite in that it can 'eat' a large number of different substrates in order to grow. Could E. coli use the cement separating the wells for its growth? This was a tested in a special medium where the cement material consisted the only source of carbon and energy for the bacterium. We found that neither E. coli nor many other bacteria could do so. So this wasn't the answer either.    <P>
We then considered the possibility that intolerable levels of pressure exerted on the card when it was filled with the suspension containing the bacteria and subsequently when the fluid flow was started had a role in this problem. We thus drastically modified the method concerning these two aspects, and used precise control over the pressure exerted during these operations. This decreased the degree of failure of the card and pointed the way for a potential solution: decreasing the pore size of the card’s filters (that would still allow passage of liquids but not that of bacteria), and control of pressure.     <P>
Two versions of the fluidic card with the decreased filter pore size were designed. The first replaced the existing 0.45µm filters with 0.22µm filter of the same material in the current cards. The second utilized a whole sheet of 0.2µm polycarbonate filter material in an attempt to eliminate any potential for organisms to travel around the filter discs.  Extensive testing with fluidic cards having both the 0.22µm nylon filters and whole sheet polycarbonate filters has resulted in showing that no leakage of bacteria occurs for the duration that is needed for successful experiment in space.    <P>
We are therefore now ready to run full simulation of the space experimental scheme on Earth. This I believe to be genuine progress towards the successful realization of the experiments in space and the testing of the hypotheses of the proposal.      <P>

The research underway will provide a critical test for a hypothesis, which if confirmed, will show the way to greatly mitigate bacterial resistance to antibiotics in general. This hypothesis is based on a firm foundation provided by experiments conducted on Earth; and since bacterial resistance increases under microgravity conditions, its testing in space provides an amplified situation where the difference made by the absence of the gene responsible can be seen more clearly.    <P>
The innovative technology that we expect to develop is generation of small molecules that can silence the gene in question, which can then either be used alone (since the resulting weakened bacteria can be more easily dealt with by the immune system) or in combination with existing antibiotics for effective treatment of infectious disease here on Earth as well as in space. <P></td>

						The work involved completion of Phase A of the project and progress on the next phase. Phase A concerned defining conditions for preparing the culture of the bacteria so that when the satellite is launched, there will be a suitable inoculum to successfully start the experiment, selection of an appropriate medium for this purpose as well as the antibiotic. A further task has been to ensure that AlamarBlue (AB) can be used for monitoring growth during space flight. All these tasks were successfully completed and an experimental protocol designed and agreed up. This is as follows:    <P>
Culture density for satellite loading: A600 of 10 x 0.05 in M9 salt solution; Dilute 10:1 in M9 solution; Add 1/6th potency LB to initiate growth; After 12 h (final A600 : ca. 0.5), wash in M9; Starve in M9 for 24 h; Add gentamycin (three conc. around 20 µg/ml [i.e., 10, 20, 30 in separate experimental wells]); Incubate 24 h; Add AB; follow viability for as long as practical.    <P>
The Ames team developed and refined a loading procedure for the new version of the fluidic card with the smaller filter pore size necessary to contain the bacteria. The fluidic card biocompatibility testing has been started, a number of fluidic cards have been loaded with the flight organisms. The survival of the organism stored in the card is compared to organisms stored in standard lab ware. Two completed tests show no biocompatibility concerns but other tests are still ongoing.    <P>
Throughout the work there has been excellent contact, co-operation and rapport between the Ames and Stanford teams. Dr. Matin presented several talks at Ames and helped in the work there; the Ames team members have visited Stanford almost on a weekly basis, and each Wednesday the progress and plans are discussed in a conference call between the two teams. Further, Mr. Matthew Lara of NASA has been appointed a visiting scholar at Stanford so he could work closely with Dr. Matin’s team.   <P>
