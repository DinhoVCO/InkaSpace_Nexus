                    <td colspan="3"> The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e., primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g., mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on Earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA (NASA Research Announcement) because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies. <P></td>

The focus of this research will be on the development of roots and how they modify the expression of their genes to adapt to the microgravity environment of spaceflight.     <P>
This research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of their cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature to overcome the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth. <P></td>

						We achieved all of the major milestones we set for this proposal. Malfunction of the ABRS hardware on the ISS, de-manifestation from Space X-3, and delays in the launch of Space X-5 were set-backs we encountered during the first two years of the grant. However, we were able to overcome these early problems and completed most of the specific aims that we proposed. A major accomplishment of this proposal was the implementation of a simple method to delay germination of Arabidopsis seeds until experimental activation in space. We foresee that many in the plant space biology community will benefit from these methods. Another direct outcome of this grant is the discovery of novel plant proteins involved in modulating the cytoskeleton. These results have been published in high impact peer-reviewed publications.    <P>
We also successfully retrieved material from ground- and space-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. Processing and data analysis from these spaceflight experiments have been completed. We have deposited raw RNA-Seq data from our spaceflight work to the NASA GeneLab site but these have not yet been publicly released. During this funding period, we also completed glycomic studies of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in space and compared them with the corresponding ground controls. Both the transcriptomics (i.e., RNA-Seq) and glycomics results will be submitted this year for peer-review.    <P>
Taken together, our RNA-Seq and glycomics results continue to point to the spaceflight environment as a major trigger for oxidative stress responses in plants. Our results suggest that the ideal plant ideotype for future space habitats could be similar to those that have been developed for marginal agricultural lands on Earth including crops tolerant to low oxygen (e.g., hypoxia) and other stressors (drought, insect resistance) as well as those with more robust cell wall mechanical properties. Such findings could be the bases of future spaceflight experiments wherein performance of plants with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress can be evaluated on hardware such as the advanced plant habitat (APH) or the Spectrum. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e., primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g., mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on Earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies. <P></td>

This research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth  in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of its cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature to overcome the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth. <P></td>

						We have made substantial progress with this project during this reporting period. We can attribute our success to the fact that in-orbit operations were completed in early 2015 allowing us to process our spaceflight samples during this reporting period. Highlights of our progress include the following:    <P>
1). We verified that directional root skewing occurs in microgravity. These results are consistent with previous spaceflight studies on a different set of hardware (i.e., BRIC). For our current experiments, we used the VEGGIE hardware and seedlings were grown under continuous light. However, similar skewing responses were observed in the BRIC hardware for seedlings grown in continuous dark.    <P>
2). Assembly and mapping of the sequence reads from RNA-Seq experiments were completed during this reporting period. In summary, total sequence reads from the samples ranged from 75- 120 million with more than 95% mapping to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR version 10). Basic statistical analyses indicate high quality reads from our transcriptomic efforts. We found that genes differentially regulated by microgravity could be classified into six gene ontology (GO) clusters based on biological function. Interestingly, genes in the three GO clusters overrepresented were involved in root hair growth and oxidative stress (e.g., peroxidases). It is noteworthy that similar classes of genes were shown to be repressed in microgravity from dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings on our previous BRIC 16 experiments. Our most recent transcriptomics data continue to point to the spaceflight environment as a major trigger for oxidative stress responses in plants. This indicates that developing the ideal plant ideotype for future space habitats could be patterned from plant culitvars that have been developed for marginal agricultural lands including crops tolerant to low oxygen (e.g., hypoxia) and other stressors (drought, insect resistance) as well as those with more robust cell wall mechanical properties.    <P>
3). We demonstrated the feasibility of using glycome profiling to assess the impact of microgravity on cell wall composition. We obtained excellent results from a small amount of space flown tissue (i.e., we were able to extract cell walls from plant debris from columns used for RNA extraction).  This allowed us to optimize the use of limited spaceflight material. In summary, our glycome profiling work indicate that microgravity triggers alterations in cell wall composition in part because of changes in expression of genes encoding cell wall remodeling proteins. Further, we demonstrated the feasibility of glycome profiling to identify specific components of the plant cell wall that are altered by spaceflight. Finally, immunolabeling using mABs of plant sections enabled us to identify cell/tissue types where microgravity-triggered cell wall composition occurred.    <P>
4). Ground-based studies led to the discovery of a novel protein involved in actin-mediated post-Golgi trafficking. This novel protein was named HLB1 for hypersensitive to latrunculin B 1. Latrunculin B is a potent compound that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. The HLB1 protein was discovered through a forward genetic screen of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on latrunculin B. Our results have been published in the high-impact journal Plant Cell because the work has led to the discovery of a protein complex that links vesicular trafficking in plants with activities of the cytoskeleton. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e., primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g., mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on Earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies. <P></td>

The focus of this research will be on the development of roots and how they modify the expression of their genes to adapt to the microgravity environment of spaceflight.     <P>
This research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth  in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of its cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature to overcome the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth. <P></td>

						As noted in our report last year, the original APEX (Advanced Plant EXperiments) proposal submission was designed to use the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) on board the ISS.  Unfortunately, the ABRS hardware on the ISS experienced technical issues in regard to the control of specific environmental parameters. These issues could not be resolved in time for SpaceX-3 launch, which was the mission we were assigned to. Thus, we were de-manifested from SpaceX-3 and moved to SpaceX-5. Continued technical issues with ABRS also required us to use an alternative hardware called the vegetable production system (VEGGIE) for our experiments.     <P>
We are pleased to report that SpaceX-5 carrying APEX 03-1 launched on January 10, 2015 after a couple of delays. Experiment activation on-orbit occurred on January 15, 2015. 6 day harvest of seedlings took place on January 21, 2015 and the 11 day harvest was completed on January 26, 2015. The Dragon capsule carrying the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Fixation Tubes (KFTs) with preserved plant material returned to Earth on February 10, 2015. After de-integration of KFTs at KSC, fixed samples were delivered to the Noble Foundation on February 18, 2015. Inspection and processing of fixed plant material began immediately.	    <P>
For APEX 03-1, we flew ten 9 cm x 9 cm Petri dishes containing 18-24 Arabidopsis seeds. Germination of seeds took place only in orbit. Controlled germination of seeds was accomplished using far-red light seed pretreatment and maintaining plates at 40C in the dark. Experiment activation was triggered on orbit by removing plates from cold stowage and mounting the plates vertically on the VEGGIE unit. Upon exposure to light and 230C temperature on VEGGIE, the seed germinated. Based on the number of plants recovered upon sample return, we found that we had more than 90% germination. No problems with premature germination were reported by the crew. After 6 days and 11 days of experiment activation, seedlings were photographed by ISS commander Butch Wilmore. A corresponding set of ground control seedlings were photographed at the KSC-ISSES facility.  For each time point (i.e., 6 days and 11 days), seedlings were carefully transferred to KFTs containing either glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde solution or RNALater. The former solution allowed preservation of cell structure for downstream microscopic analysis. The latter solution preserved material for gene expression studies using RNASeq.       <P>
There were problems encountered in KFT actuation of ground control samples. Most notable were samples from 6 day old ground control seedlings fixed in RNALater. In cases where KFTs failed to actuate, seedlings were not in contact with the RNALater fixative for about 30 minutes. Seedlings in defective KFTs were eventually transferred manually to falcon tubes containing RNALater. However, the 30 minutes that seedlings were exposed to air within the jammed KFTs might have triggered a desiccation stress responses. Jammed KFTs also occurred during the 11 day harvest operations. However, because the team was aware of the possibility that some of the newly constructed KFTs might not actuate properly, contingency measures were planned. The advanced planning allowed the team to immediately transfer seedlings from jammed KFTs to falcon tubes containing fixatives that mirrored the time of actuation in space. Therefore, risks associated with jammed KFTs were mitigated.      	  Roots and shoots from RNALater fixed plants (space and corresponding ground controls) were separated manually. RNA from each tissue type was extracted following standard protocols. RNA extraction was completed on March 17 and 18, 2015. We sent RNA to our genomics core facility to determine RNA integrity numbers (RIN). RIN is an indicator of RNA quality and therefore will inform us if plant material obtained from APEX 03-1 will generate reliable data sets. The Bioanalyzer (i.e., the instrument used to determine RIN) algorithm assigns RIN values from a scale of 1 (most degraded) to 10 (least degraded). RIN values from both space samples and the corresponding ground controls ranged from 9.4 to 10. These values indicate that RNA quality from APEX 03-1 material was very high. The high RNA quality now allows us to move forward with library construction for sequencing. This task is currently in progress. Completion of the RNA quality tests is crucial for aim 3 of our proposal.   The RNA yield from roots and shoots ranged from 200 ng/microL to 600 ng/microL. The volume of RNA we have on hand is about 40 microL. We therefore have sufficient RNA to complete the proposed RNASeq studies and verification assays by quantitative real-time PCR. The total number of RNA samples we completed for yield and quality analysis is 24 representing 2 time points (6 and 11 days), 2 tissue types (shoots and roots), 2 treatments (space versus ground), and 3 biological replicates.    <P>
We also completed preliminary processing of seedlings fixed in glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde for downstream structural and immunological assays. Individual seedlings are now stored in 15 mL falcon tubes awaiting embedding.      <P>
For this reporting period we also published a paper on our transcript profiling work on Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the BRIC hardware flown on the second to the last mission of the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) (see Kwon et al., 2015). In this paper we report that genes involved in oxidative stress and cell wall remodeling were differentially regulated in microgravity in both wild-type and actin mutants. Several of the genes associated with cell walls and oxidative stress that were downregulated in microgravity were preferentially expressed in root hairs based on in silico analyses.  Reverse genetic screening for mutants to some of the root-hair-expressed genes downregulated in microgravity led to the identification of transfer (T)- DNA insertion lines in two class III peroxidase genes (Valério et al., 2004 ) with short root hairs due to their tips rupturing. The isolation of new peroxidase mutants that displayed root hair phenotypes coupled with the observation that microgravity grown seedlings had shorter root hairs, supports our spaceflight transcriptomic studies, and provides evidence linking microgravity-induced cell wall and root hair defects with changes in gene expression. These results point to the spacecraft environment as a trigger for oxidative stress responses in plants that can be manifested in part as disrupted cell wall development and defective root hair growth.     <P>
The PI (Blancaflor) also completed editing a book for Springer title “Plant Gravitropism: Methods and Protocols.”  This volume contains a collection of methods for studying gravity responses in a variety of plant organs and cell types. Many of the contributors to this volume are NASA funded PIs including Dr. Jin Nakashima (Co-PI in this proposal). Several chapters in this volume provide overviews on plant space biology. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e. primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g. RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g. mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies. <P></td>

This research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal, namely root development and cell wall biology, are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth  in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of its cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature despite the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth.      <P>

						For the first and second year of this grant, we completed both the Science Verification Test (SVT) and the Payload Verification Test (PVT). The SVT was held at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in October, 2012 while the PVT was conducted in March, 2013, also at KSC. Results from the APEX 02-1 SVT and PVT were submitted for peer review this year and the manuscript is currently in press with the journal, Gravitational and Space Research (Nakashima et al., 2014b). Some of the results that will be published in Gravitational and Space Research are briefly presented in below.    <P>
SVT and PVT focused on two success criteria. First, we evaluated a system to delay Arabidopsis seed germination until installation on ABRS. Second, we assessed the quality of seedling fixation on Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs) for post-flight microscopic analyses. The former criterion was important to ensure that seedling development occurred only in microgravity and therefore minimized any additional source of variation that could complicate the interpretation of science results. Furthermore, delaying seed germination until the experiment was activated on ABRS would eliminate the need for replanting in case the launch was postponed by several days or weeks. The ability to delay seed germination could also provide the ISS crew flexibility in regard to timing Petri plate installation on ABRS.     <P>
SVT and PVT led to the design of a portable metal box for FR illumination that would enable us to delay Arabidopsis seed germination until installation on ABRS. The short FR light treatment did not compromise seed viability and could potentially delay germination for up to 10 weeks in the Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype. Through SVT and PVT, we have also determined an optimal fixative composition as well as additional ways to handle fixative prior to loading on KFTs. Flexibility in conducting space biology experiments is often dictated by hardware design and established operating procedures specified by NASA because of safety and other logistical issues. Lessons learned from SVT and PVT, which typically are not shared with the scientific community, can be valuable to increase the likelihood that the quality of plant material obtained from spaceflight is not compromised.     <P>
Unfortunately, after completing SVT and PVT with the ABRS, the ABRS hardware on the ISS experienced technical issues in regard to the control of specific environmental parameters. It was determined that these issues could not be resolved in time for SpaceX-3 launch. Thus, we were de-manifested from SpaceX-3 and we were informed of the need to use an alternative hardware. The hardware chosen for implementation of our spaceflight experiments is the vegetable production unit (VEGGIE). The new experiments using VEGGIE are now called APEX03-1 (original experiment was APEX02-1). SVT for APEX03 is scheduled for June, 2014. Prior to SVT we completed preliminary testing of the VEGGIE hardware in February, 2014. We found that VEGGIE is able to support robust growth of Arabidopsis seedlings, which should still allow us to accomplish the original goals of APEX02-1. However, one drawback of using VEGGIE is that we can no longer obtain root growth measurements with increased temporal resolution. Root images will only be obtained at two time points (i.e. during the 7 day and 14 day harvest). <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e. primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g. RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g. mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research will provide a deeper understanding of how microgravity influences plant development. The focus of this research will be on the development of roots and how they modify the expression of their genes to adapt to the microgravity environment of spaceflight.   This research will address one of high priority recommendations of the National Research Council’s 2011 decadal survey report, which is to contribute significantly to building a robust spaceflight program to analyze plant physiological responses to stimuli encountered in microgravity.  Research areas depicted in this proposal namely root development and cell wall biology are significant for NASA’s goal of developing large plant habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) and future space colonies. We expect that information gained from basic studies of root growth  in microgravity will guide the development of plant varieties better equipped to optimize nutrient and water acquisition, and waste recycling in enclosed regenerative life support systems. Furthermore, because upright plants evolved under the 1-g conditions of Earth in large part through the mechanical strength of its cell walls, this research will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the genetic networks that specify how cell walls are constructed in microgravity. In space, such knowledge will enable technologies for designing plants that can sustain optimal growth and stature despite the adverse impact that microgravity has on cell wall development. With regard to Earth benefits, understanding of molecular pathways that govern root growth and cell wall development, will benefit agricultural practices and bioenergy research on Earth.      <P>

						During the first year of the grant we completed the Science Verification Test (SVT) and the Payload Verification Test (PVT) both of which were conducted at the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The SVT was held in October, 2012 and the PVT in March, 2013. We also completed crew training with Astronaut Michael Hopkins at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas in May, 2013. All three operations were successful and their completion now place us in an excellent position for launching our experiments, which are scheduled for deployment to the ISS on Space X-3 in the Fall, 2013.    <P>
For both SVT and PVT, we grew Arabidopsis seedlings in six 9 cm square Perit dishes on the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware ground unit for 7 and 14-days. RNA from 14-day old seedlings  was extracted to test RNA integrity number (RIN) and yield. The data allowed us to evaluate the suitablity of the ABRS hardware growth conditions  for collecting samples for aim 3 of the proposal. We found that RNA samples from ABRS-grown Arabidopsis seedlings during SVT and PVT met the minimum requirements for RIN and yield. For SVT, RIN numbers ranged from 8.0 to 8.7 (with a RIN of 10 being the highest possible value). On the other hand, RNA yield ranged from 51 ng/uL to 452 ng/uL and this should be sufficient for the proposed RNA-Seq experiments. For PVT, RIN values ranged from 7-10.  One change we made during PVT was that we were able to separate shoots from the roots and still get sufficient RIN and RNA yields. We expect that this improvement will add significant value to the actual ISS-ABRS experiments because it would allow us to explore microgravity-induced gene expression changes specific to each organ type.    <P>
Seed germination during SVT and PVT was excellent ( almost 100% in both trials). During PVT, we refined a simple method for delaying Arabidopsis seed germination until the the imbibed seeds were exposed to white light on ABRS. This method involved exposure of planted seed to red light and maintaining Petri dishes in cold and in the dark prior to installation on ABRS.    <P>
For SVT, we  processed seedlings fixed in Glutaraldehyde for light microscopy to examine general root morphology and quality of labeling using selected cell wall specific monoclonal antibodies (aim 1 of this proposal). We found that antigenicity to the cell wall was adequately preserved in root cells from seedlings grown on ABRS. Although, immunocytochemistry with cell wall antibodies was successful, we noted some problems in some aspects of sample preservation. For example, primary cell walls fixed in the Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs) showed smeared patterns when stained with toluidine blue dye. In optimally fixed material, primary cell walls should display a crisp bright blue and purple color. There was also degradation of cytosolic components of the root  and suggests that glutaraldehyde degraded slightly during SVT. We made some slight modifications in the fixative concentration for PVT and are curently evaluating the material.     <P>
We also traveled to JSC to train Astronaut, Col. Michael Hopkins on the harvest and fixation of 7- and 14-day old Arabidopsis seedlings. Col. Hopkins indicated that the harvest and fixation procedures were very clear, and should be easily implemented onboard the ISS.    <P>
During this reporting period, two peer-reviewed articles were published. One article  was a review paper in the tropisms issue of the American Journal of Botany. This paper critically examines how the actin cytoskeleton mediates plant gravitropism, a topic that is central to this proposal. Another paper that will be published in a 2013 plants in space special issue of  the journal Plant Biology describes root morphology and cell wall ultrastructure from Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the Biological Rsearch in Canisters (BRIC). It is important to point out the latter publication in this report because our proposed experiments on ABRS builds on our BRIC results and a root orientation algorthm described in the aforementioned paper will be applied to quantify root orientation (aim 1 of this proposal).    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The overall goal of this proposal is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). This proposal builds on a robust dataset from our rapid turnaround spaceflight experiments, which utilized the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC16) hardware on the STS-131 mission. Through experiments with the BRIC hardware, we discovered that spaceflight had a profound influence on the expression of genes involved in regulating cell wall architecture. This led us to hypothesize that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. Because of the prominent root developmental phenotypes (i.e. primary root skewing and inhibition of root hair growth) that we observed in our BRIC experiments, it appears that microgravity-dependent changes in cell wall-related transcripts are predominantly manifested in roots. Furthermore, because primary root and root cell wall ultrastructural defects were most pronounced in a mutant to a vegetative actin isoform (act2), we hypothesize that microgravity predominantly affects genes that lie within signaling networks linking the actin cytoskeleton with the plant extracellular matrix.  Given our successful experiments with BRIC, we are in an excellent position to effectively utilize the unique capabilities of the ABRS hardware on the ISS to test the aforementioned hypotheses. We will use a new algorithm that we developed from our BRIC16 experiments to more rigorously quantify root growth behavior of wild-type and a higher order vegetative actin mutant (act2 act8 double mutant) (aim 1). This will clarify the extent of actin involvement in specifying root orientation and cell wall remodeling in space. Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and immunocytochemistry, we will also determine how the distribution and abundance of specific cell wall components change in microgravity, and correlate such changes with root developmental responses and modifications in gene expression (aim 2). Finally, we will employ more sensitive deep sequencing technologies (e.g. RNA-Seq) to discover novel microgravity-induced transcriptional changes in plants (aim 3). Knowledge from our spaceflight studies will then be translated into corresponding gene functional studies (e.g. mutant analysis and overexpression), which we expect will lead to the discovery of new players that modulate root development on earth and in microgravity. The proposed work is therefore relevant to this NASA-NRA because it will address fundamental questions on how gravity modulates the plant's internal cytoarchitecture and the molecular processes that govern the development of its cell walls. This will be significant for NASA's mission as extrapolated in the priorities of the Fundamental Space Biology Plan for 2010-2020 because it will provide us with basic knowledge to guide genetic engineering efforts to generate plants that are better adapted to the weightless environment of spaceflight. This in turn will be beneficial for the design of large plant habitats on the ISS and future space colonies. <P></td>
