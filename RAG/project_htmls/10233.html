                    <td colspan="3"> How plants respond to gravity is a fundamental biological question with important implications for spaceflight. Here we propose ground-based research designed to lead to spaceflight, in the area of plant biology. Our experimental approach focuses on several families of putative mechanoreceptors known as mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. MS ion channels have been proposed to play a role in the perception of gravity in plants for many years, a hypothesis that is supported by several lines of evidence, but one that has not yet been systematically tested by molecular genetics. The research plan utilizes contemporary methodologies for the study of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to interrogate the biological function of plant MS ion channels and builds upon previous NASA-funded research into the response of plants to altered gravity environments. We will determine the role played by MS ion channels in mediating gravity signal transduction, their putative roles in adaptation to microgravity, and the molecular mechanisms by which the model MS ion channel MSL10 activates stress-response pathways in plant cells. We expect that these activities will have the following outcomes: 1) Test the long-standing hypothesis that MS ion channels function in gravity perception; 2) Contribute to our basic knowledge regarding how plants exploit MS ion channels to sense and respond to mechanical stress; 3) Provide information that could be used on Earth to improve crop productivity; and 4) Establish a foundation of knowledge required to generate more mechanistic and sophisticated hypotheses about plant gravity perception that can be tested in spaceflight using the European Modular Cultivation System and/or the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Imaging system. (These proposed studies directly address the objectives of the solicitation, as they aim to answer basic questions about how plants respond to changes in gravity and should lead to hypotheses that can be tested on future spaceflights.) <P></td>

						Research Progress May 2016-July 2017    <P>
Aim 1: Test the Hypothesis that MS ion channels Play a Role in Root Gravitropism Using a Machine Vision and Computation Approach. Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels have been implicated in a variety of steps in gravity signaling, but are most often implicated in the initial gravity response. MS ion channels have been proposed to sense ER membrane tension as a result of the amyloplasts sedimentation; the plasma membrane tension resulting from the uneven pressure of the tonoplast at the bottom of the cell; or the action of amyloplasts on actin microfilaments tethered to the plasma membrane. There are at least three potential barriers to the identification of MS ion channels in forward genetic screens for genes involved in gravity response: 1) redundancy of MS ion channel gene function; 2) redundancy of gravity response pathways involving MS ion channels; and 3) subtle effects of MS ion channel function on the gravity response. We aim to test the long-held hypothesis that MS ion channels mediate the perception of changes in gravity vector using a reverse genetics approach and a highly sensitive Machine Vision and Computation assay for defects in gravity perception.    <P>
Progress: We further characterized the gravity defect in the msl2 msl3 mutants. The msl2 msl3 double mutant lacks MS channels in the plastid envelope. While the msl2 msl3 mutant shows overall defects in orientation when grown vertically on solid media, or on a re-positioning machine, there are developmental defects that complication interpretation. Several aspects of cellular morphology that are key for gravity response disappear or appear disorganized in msl2 msl3 mutants compared to those in wild type seedlings. We tested a range of media with added osmotic support and saw that we could suppress these phenotypes to some degree, but in the end were unable to generate growth conditions where root growth was normal enough to feel confident that defects in gravity could be attributed to perception rather than to anatomical differences.    <P>
We worked towards generating msl9 msl10 pgm and msl4 msl5 msl6 pgm mutants.    <P>
We tested several AtPiezo CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockouts for gravity defects but did not observe any.    <P>
Aim 2: Test the Hypothesis that MSL and other MS ion channels are involved in the perception and/or Adaptation to Weightlessness.     <P>
Progress: We do not have progress to report on this aim.    <P>
Aim 3: Determine the Molecular Mechanism of MSL10-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Signaling. MS ion channels are implicated in the perception and/or response to changes in gravity conditions. The experiments in this aim are designed to gain a more molecular and mechanistic handle on the regulation and signaling behavior of MS ion channels, building on our recent observations that overexpressing the MscS-Like MS ion channel MSL10 from A. thaliana leads to ROS-associated cell death. Understanding how MSL10 is regulated and how its activation leads to ROS-related stress signaling may be important for mitigating the effects of mechanical stress on crop plants or plants in the space environment.    <P>
Progress:    <P>
A. We established that endogenous expression of unphosphorylated MSL10 and a single point mutation the MSL10 C-terminus result in the hyper-accumulation of ROS. Furthermore, the chaperone complex SGT1/RAR1/HSP90 is required for this phenomenon.    <P>
Previous years we showed that overexpression of MSL10 leads to cell death signaling and the production of ROS at endogenous levels of expression. Now we can say that dephosphorylation-dependent cell death signaling does not require overexpression of MSL10, as we observe cell death, dwarfing, and the production of ROS in plants expressing phospho-dead MSL10, but not phospho-mimic MSL10 at endogenous levels. Furthermore, a single EMS-induced point mutation in the MSL10 C terminus, S640L, produces the same phenotypes.    <P>
HSP90 and its co-chaperone SGT1 play a conserved role in plant and animal innate immunity by stabilizing pathogen sensors called NLR proteins. It was also recently reported that HSP90 and SGT1 stabilize a hormone receptor in response to heat stress, indicating that this chaperone complex plays a role in both biotic and abiotic stress responses. We found that HSP90, SGT1, and RAR1 are all required for MSL10-induced cell death in the transient tobacco expression assay, and for the hyper-accumulation of ROS, indicating that the same is true in stably transformed plants. However, we do not detect direct interactions between MSL10 and any of these components by a variety of methods.     <P>
B. We determined that 14-3-3 proteins interact with MSL10 in a specific manner.   14-3-3 proteins are evolutionarily conserved proteins that often recognize and bind to the loose consensus sequences R/KXXS or R/KXXXS, subsequently regulating the function of their binding partners or “clients” via effects on enzyme activity, subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction, conformation, or stability. Four of the seven in vivo phosphorylated residues in the MSL10 N-terminus are part of a 14-3-3 consensus binding site. While full-length MSL10 interacts with all 14-3-3 proteins in the split-ubiquitin yeast two hybrid, the introduction of four point mutations designed to disrupt the 14-3-3 consensus sequences at S48, S57, S128, and S131 also disrupt the interaction. As is shown, MSL10K45A K53A K124A R127A interacts normally with the positive control in this assay.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> How plants respond to gravity is a fundamental biological question with important implications for spaceflight. Here we propose ground-based research designed to lead to spaceflight, in the area of plant biology. Our experimental approach focuses on several families of putative mechanoreceptors known as mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. MS ion channels have been proposed to play a role in the perception of gravity in plants for many years, a hypothesis that is supported by several lines of evidence, but one that has not yet been systematically tested by molecular genetics. The research plan utilizes contemporary methodologies for the study of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to interrogate the biological function of plant MS ion channels and builds upon previous NASA-funded research into the response of plants to altered gravity environments. We will determine the role played by MS ion channels in mediating gravity signal transduction, their putative roles in adaptation to microgravity, and the molecular mechanisms by which the model MS ion channel MSL10 activates stress-response pathways in plant cells. We expect that these activities will have the following outcomes: 1) Test the long-standing hypothesis that MS ion channels function in gravity perception; 2) Contribute to our basic knowledge regarding how plants exploit MS ion channels to sense and respond to mechanical stress; 3) Provide information that could be used on Earth to improve crop productivity; and 4) Establish a foundation of knowledge required to generate more mechanistic and sophisticated hypotheses about plant gravity perception that can be tested in spaceflight using the European Modular Cultivation System and/or the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Imaging system. (These proposed studies directly address the objectives of the solicitation, as they aim to answer basic questions about how plants respond to changes in gravity and should lead to hypotheses that can be tested on future spaceflights.) <P></td>

Aim 1: Test the Hypothesis that MS ion channels Play a Role in Root Gravitropism Using a Machine Vision and Computation Approach    <P>
Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels have been implicated in a variety of steps in gravity signaling, but are most often implicated in the initial gravity response. MS ion channels have been proposed to sense ER membrane tension as a result of the amyloplasts sedimentation; the plasma membrane tension resulting from the uneven pressure of the tonoplast at the bottom of the cell; or the action of amyloplasts on actin microfilaments tethered to the plasma membrane. There are at least three potential barriers to the identification of MS ion channels in forward genetic screens for genes involved in gravity response: 1) redundancy of MS ion channel gene function; 2) redundancy of gravity response pathways involving MS ion channels; and 3) subtle effects of MS ion channel function on the gravity response. We aim to test the long-held hypothesis that MS ion channels mediate the perception of changes in gravity vector using a reverse genetics approach and a highly sensitive Machine Vision and Computation assay for defects in gravity perception.    <P>
Progress:     <P>
A. We continued with machine imaging of root gravitropism of higher order mechanosensitive ion channel AND gravity signaling mutants. Now we are not just looking at higher order combinations of lesions in related MS ion channel genes, but combining these with other lesions in previously defined gravity response pathways. Specifically we are looking at genetic interactions between MSL genes and 1) ALTERED RESPONSE TO GRAVITY2 (ARL2), which encodes a protein of unknown molecular function or 2) PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE (PGM), which encodes an enzyme required for plastids to accumulate starch. Edgar Spalding’s lab at U. Wisconsin (a co-PI on this grant) conducted root gravitropism analysis on the lines listed below. Each set of seed was collected from plants that were co-grown to reduce variability in phenotype at the seedling level due to maternal health.    <P>
The results are quite interesting, and not at all expected. We’d previously seen that msl mutant gravity response is indistinguishable from the wild type, and this observation was repeated (compare black and blue lines). Also as expected, arl2-3 mutants showed a strong defect in root gravity response with a slow and attenuated change in root tip angle after gravity stimulation. Unexpectedly, however, this defect is slightly rescued by msl9 msl10 lesions in the arl2-3 background. On the other hand, the strong defect in root gravity response expected from the pgm-1 lesion is enhanced by the quintuple msl background.    <P>
B. Chris Wolverton at Ohio Wesleyan has characterized root gravitropism in msl mutant lines using a second sensitive method. A ROTATO is a constant feedback stimulus system that maintains the root at a constant angle over a period of hours, responding to live imaging of root tip bending. His group found that msl2 msl3 mutants show an extreme defect in root gravity response, and quintuple msl4 msl5 mls6 msl9 msl10 mutants have a more modest, but reproducible, effect. These data support our hypothesis that msl channels may be involved in sensing and responding to gravity stimulus.     <P>
C. We have been pursuing the role played by the AtPiezo mutant in gravity response. As no T-DNA alleles were available, we have constructed two CRISPR/Cas9 mutant lines, obtained another two CRISPR/Cas9 lines from the Meyerowitz lab, and are also constructing inducible RNAi silencing lines.     <P>
Aim 3: Determine the Molecular Mechanism of MSL10-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Signaling     <P>
MS ion channels are implicated in the perception and/or response to changes in gravity conditions. The experiments in this aim are designed to gain a more molecular and mechanistic handle on the regulation and signaling behavior of MS ion channels, building on our recent observations that overexpressing the MscS-Like MS ion channel MSL10 from A. thaliana leads to ROS-associated cell death. Understanding how MSL10 is regulated and how its activation leads to ROS-related stress signaling may be important for mitigating the effects of mechanical stress on crop plants or plants in the space environment.    <P>
Under this funding, we previously found that MSL10 induces cell death signaling in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and that the N-terminus of MSL10 alone can provide this activity, independent of the ion channel function of the channel.    <P>
Progress:    <P>
A. Identification and characterization of an EMS allele of msl10 that also induces ROS accumulation.   It was reported last year by Jian-Min Zhou’s group in China that an EMS-induced mutation in the soluble C-terminus of the MSL10 channel, S640L, results in plants with ectopic programmed cell death. We obtained seeds for this line (called rea1 for RAP2.6 expresser in shoot apex) from this group and have shown that, similar to overexpression of MSL10, rea1 plants hyper-accumulate ROS. We have collected additional information on plant morphology, gene expression and in heterologous cell death assays that indicate that the rea1 mutant is inducing cell death through the same pathway as overexpression of MSL10. Because overexpression-induced cell death can be completely attenuated by phospho-mimic residues in the C-terminus (Veley et al., 2014), we propose that the c-terminal mutation in rea1 is acting through the phosphor-regulated mechanism of the N-terminus.     <P>

PLASTID OSMOTIC STRESS INFLUENCES CELL DIFFERENTIATION AT THE PLANT SHOOT APEX, Margaret E. Wilson1, Matthew Mixdorf1, R. Howard Berg2 and Elizabeth S. Haswell1    <P>

The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell fate decisions at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, the down-regulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL and is reduced in the absence of the cytokinin receptor AHK2. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus requires elevated plastidic ROS, ABA biosynthesis, and retrograde signaling proteins GUN1 and ABI4. These results establish a functional link between the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling in controlling cell fate at the shoot apex. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> How plants respond to gravity is a fundamental biological question with important implications for space flight. Here we propose ground-based research designed to lead to spaceflight, in the area of plant biology. Our experimental approach focuses on several families of putative mechanoreceptors known as mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. MS ion channels have been proposed to play a role in the perception of gravity in plants for many years, a hypothesis that is supported by several lines of evidence, but one that has not yet been systematically tested by molecular genetics. The research plan utilizes contemporary methodologies for the study of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to interrogate the biological function of plant MS ion channels and builds upon previous NASA-funded research into the response of plants to altered gravity environments. We will determine the role played by MS ion channels in mediating gravity signal transduction, their putative roles in adaptation to microgravity, and the molecular mechanisms by which the model MS ion channel MSL10 activates stress-response pathways in plant cells. We expect that these activities will have the following outcomes: 1) Test the long-standing hypothesis that MS ion channels function in gravity perception; 2) Contribute to our basic knowledge regarding how plants exploit MS ion channels to sense and respond to mechanical stress; 3) Provide information that could be used on Earth to improve crop productivity; and 4) Establish a foundation of knowledge required to generate more mechanistic and sophisticated hypotheses about plant gravity perception that can be tested in spaceflight using the European Modular Cultivation System and/or the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Imaging system. (These proposed studies directly address the objectives of the solicitation, as they aim to answer basic questions about how plants respond to changes in gravity and should lead to hypotheses that can be tested on future spaceflights.) <P></td>

						Aim 1: Test the Hypothesis that MS Ion Channels Play a Role in Root Gravitropism Using a Machine Vision and Computation Approach    <P>
Introduction:   Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels have been implicated in a variety of steps in gravity signaling, but are most often implicated in the initial gravity response. MS ion channels have been proposed to sense ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membrane tension as a result of the amyloplasts sedimentation; the plasma membrane tension resulting from the uneven pressure of the tonoplast at the bottom of the cell; or the action of amyloplasts on actin microfilaments tethered to the plasma membrane. There are at least three potential barriers to the identification of MS ion channels in forward genetic screens for genes involved in gravity response: 1) redundancy of MS ion channel gene function; 2) redundancy of gravity response pathways involving MS ion channels; and 3) subtle effects of MS ion channel function on the gravity response. We aim to test the long-held hypothesis that MS ion channels mediate the perception of changes in gravity vector by using a reverse genetics approach and a highly sensitive Machine Vision and Computation assay for defects in gravity perception.    <P>
Progress:     <P>
A. We produced three new higher order mutants lacking functional mechanosensitive ion channels and/or components of known gravity signaling pathways. To determine the role of MS channels in gravity response, we are combining mutations that produce lesions in multiple channels and/or signaling pathways. We have made msl9 msl10 arl2 triple mutants, msl4 msl5 msl6 msl9 msl10 arl2 hextuple mutants; and msl4 msl5 msl6 msl9 msl10 pgm-1 hextuple mutant lines. These lines have been sent to Edgar Spalding at U. Wisconsin (a co-PI on this grant) for root gravitropic analysis. We are also working on removing a background mutation from the mca1 mca2 double mutant, troubleshooting genotyping the mca1 allele, and creating a knock-out of the AtPiezo MS ion channel gene using new CRISPR/Cas technology, as it appears to be essential.     <P>
B. We initiated machine imaging of root gravitropism of higher order mechanosensitive ion channel mutants. Previously generated lines were sent to Edgar Spalding at U. Wisconsin (a co-PI on this grant) for root gravitropic analysis. We found that a lesion in the MSL ion channel gene MSL4 causes seedlings to overshoot the maximum angle of bending (or have a higher “swing rate”) than wild type. Furthermore, the msl2 msl3 double mutant exhibits slow gravity response, though to a more subtle degree than previously established gravity mutants.    <P>
C. We further characterized the gravity response defect of the msl2 msl3 double mutant. The msl2 msl3 double mutant lacks MS channels in the plastid envelope. This mutant shows overall defects in orientation when grown vertically on solid media. We have been trying to determine if this defect in root gravitropism is due to defects in amyloplast development, amyloplast sedimentation, or other effects. Recent results suggest that the defect may be attributable to a loss of columella cell identity in these mutant lines. The statoliths disappear or appear disorganized compared to those in the wild type. These mutants, along with appropriate controls, are growing or will be grown for shoot gravitropism analysis in collaboration with Darron Luesse at SIUE (Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville).    <P>
Aim 2: Test the Hypothesis that MSL and Other MS Ion Channels Are Involved in the Perception and/or Adaptation to Weightlessness.    <P>
Progress: We do not have progress to report on this aim.    <P>
Aim 3: Determine the Molecular Mechanism of MSL10-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Signaling    <P>
Introduction:   MS ion channels are implicated in the perception and/or response to changes in gravity conditions. The experiments in this aim are designed to gain a more molecular and mechanistic handle on the regulation and signaling behavior of MS ion channels, building on our recent observations that overexpressing the MscS-Like MS ion channel MSL10 from A. thaliana leads to ROS-associated cell death. Understanding how MSL10 is regulated and how its activation leads to ROS-related stress signaling may be important for mitigating the effects of mechanical stress on crop plants or plants in the space environment.    <P>
We previously reported that MSL10 induces cell death signaling in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and that the N-terminus of MSL10 alone can provide this activity, independent of the ion channel function of the channel. We continue to suspect that 14-3-3 phospho-binding proteins (also called GRFs) may play a role in regulating MSL10 activity and are working on testing this idea.    <P>
Progress:    <P>
A. We explored a number of approaches to test for interactions between 14-3-3 proteins and MS ion channels. We tried the yeast two-hybrid but found that 14-3-3 proteins routinely auto-activated in that system. We then cloned and purified recombinant 14-3-3 proteins along with the soluble N-termini of MSL8, MSL9, and MSL10 produced in E. coli. Experiments are underway to assess direct interactions between these proteins.    <P>
B. We developed an assay for ROS production in response to osmotic shock. Wild-type and mutant seedlings were grown in triplicate for 8 days in 125 ml flasks containing 25 ml of 1X MS liquid media either with or without supplemental 50 mM NaCl for osmotic stress. Prior to the assay, the media in each flask was replaced with fresh, and the plants were allowed to equilibrate for 4 hours. For osmotic shock, seedlings were transferred to a multi-well plate and the samples were either subjected to up-shock (transferred from 1X MS to 1X MS with 50 mM NaCl) or down-shock (transferred from 1X MS with 50 mM NaCl to 1X MS). We hope to use this assay to to identify the MSL10 kinase and phosphatase, and develop a time course of gene expression response to osmotic shock and ROS production.    <P>
C. We pursued the effect and the source of ROS overproduction in msl2 msl3 mutants. We observed that msl2 msl3 double mutants develop large, bulbous callus-like growths on the shoot apex after growth on solid media, as shown below. These growths are associated with the extreme over-production of ROS. We are pursuing a number of lines of experimentation to provide support for our current hypothesis that a signaling pathway associated with the ratio of the phytohormone cytokinin to the phytohormone auxin induces ROS production and callus formation in this mutant plant. msl2 msl3 double mutants are indeed high overproducers of cytokinin, and auxin treatment can suppress callus production.    <P>
Summary    <P>
In conclusion, we have made good progress on both the first and the third aim over the past year and are set up to collect a great deal more data and publish several papers in the coming year. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> How plants respond to gravity is a fundamental biological question with important implications for space flight. Here we propose ground-based research designed to lead to space flight, in the area of plant biology. Our experimental approach focuses on several families of putative mechanoreceptors known as mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. MS ion channels have been proposed to play a role in the perception of gravity in plants for many years, a hypothesis that is supported by several lines of evidence, but one that has not yet been systematically tested by molecular genetics. The research plan utilizes contemporary methodologies for the study of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to interrogate the biological function of plant MS ion channels and builds upon previous NASA-funded research into the response of plants to altered gravity environments. We will determine the role played by MS ion channels in mediating gravity signal transduction, their putative roles in adaptation to microgravity; and the molecular mechanisms by which the model MS ion channel MSL10 activates stress-response pathways in plant cells. We expect that these activities will have the following outcomes: 1) Test the long-standing hypothesis that MS ion channels function in gravity perception; 2) Contribute to our basic knowledge regarding how plants exploit MS ion channels to sense and respond to mechanical stress; 3) Provide information that could be used on Earth to improve crop productivity; and 4) Establish a foundation of knowledge required to generate more mechanistic and sophisticated hypotheses about plant gravity perception that can be tested in spaceflight using the European Modular Cultivation System and/or the ABRS GFP Imaging system. (These proposed studies directly address the objectives of the solicitation, as they aim to answer basic questions about how plants respond to changes in gravity and should lead to hypotheses that can be tested on future space flights.) <P></td>

						Research Progress:    <P>
Aim 1: Test the Hypothesis that MS Ion Channels Play a Role in Root Gravitropism Using a Machine Vision and Computation Approach    <P>
Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels have been implicated in a variety of steps in gravity signaling, but are most often implicated in the initial gravity response. MS ion channels have been proposed to sense ER membrane tension as a result of the amyloplasts sedimentation; the plasma membrane tension resulting from the uneven pressure of the tonoplast at the bottom of the cell; or the action of amyloplasts on actin microfilaments tethered to the plasma membrane. There are at least three potential barriers to the identification of MS ion channels in forward genetic screens for genes involved in gravity response: 1) redundancy of MS ion channel gene function; 2) redundancy of gravity response pathways involving MS ion channels; and 3) subtle effects of MS ion channel function on the gravity response. We aim to test the long-held hypothesis that MS ion channels mediate the perception of changes in gravity vector by using a reverse genetics approach and a highly sensitive Machine Vision and Computation assay for defects in gravity perception.    <P>
Progress: We have collected a number of mutants in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana implicated in gravitropism from other labs and stock centers and collected several mutants harboring lesions in known or predicted MS channels. We have started crossing these lines to make higher order mutants in preparation for gravity testing. Once established these lines will be sent to Edgar Spalding at U. Wisconsin (a co-PI on this grant) for root gravitropic analysis and we will analyze shoot gravitropism and other phenotypes here at WUSTL.    <P>
One line we have already isolated, which lacks MS channels in the plastid envelope, shows defective root and shoot gravity response. We are following up on this observation to determine if this is due to defects in amyloplast sedimentation or in a signaling pathway.    <P>
We have made progress in instrumentation. Postdoc Maggie Wilson machined and assembled (with the help of her father) a set of polycarbonate plate trays that will help us keep our agar plates growing just a few degrees from the vertical, and we have purchased a microscope from and are right now working on setting it on its back to serve as a vertical stage microscope. We are exploring the possibility of producing a support for the microscope with a 3-D printer. Alternatively, the WUSTL machine shop has planned a support made of the usual metal components.    <P>
Aim 2: Test the Hypothesis that MSL and Other MS Ion Channels Are Involved in the Perception and/or Adaptation to Weightlessness.     <P>
Progress: We do not have progress to report on this aim.    <P>
Aim 3: Determine the Molecular Mechanism of MSL10-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Signaling     <P>
MS ion channels are implicated in the perception and/or response to changes in gravity conditions. The experiments in this aim are designed to gain a more molecular and mechanistic handle on the regulation and signaling behavior of MS ion channels, building on our recent observations that overexpressing the MscS-Like MS ion channel MSL10 from A. thaliana leads to ROS-associated cell death. Understanding how MSL10 is regulated and how its activation leads to ROS-related stress signaling may be important for mitigating the effects of mechanical stress on crop plants or plants in the space environment.    <P>
We have found that MSL10 induces cell death signaling in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and that the N-terminus of MSL10 alone can provide this activity, independent of the ion channel function of the channel. We continue to suspect that 14-3-3 phospho-binding proteins (also called GRFs) may play a role in regulating MSL10 activity and are working on testing this idea.    <P>
We have been trying to develop an assay for ROS production in response to osmotic shock. Our initial experiments growing seedlings in liquid MS + 50 mM NaCl then measuring cell death and H2O2 production have not been successful, but we have a number of ideas about ways to improve our experiments, and will be actively pursuing this approach. Once developed, such an assay could help us identify the kinase and phosphatase involved, and develop a time course of gene expression response to osmotic shock and ROS production.    <P>
We have also initiated a series of experiments to address the role of ROS production in msl2 msl3 mutants (these are the MS channels in the chloroplast membrane). We are pursuing a number of lines of evidence that suggest that a signaling pathway associated with the phytohormone cytokinin may induces ROS production and callus formation in this mutant plant. Experiments are ongoing to test this hypothesis.    <P>
Two journal articles have been submitted for publication.   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> How plants respond to gravity is a fundamental biological question with important implications for space flight. Here we propose ground-based research designed to lead to space flight, in the area of plant biology. Our experimental approach focuses on several families of putative mechanoreceptors known as mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. MS ion channels have been proposed to play a role in the perception of gravity in plants for many yearsa hypothesis that is supported by several lines of evidence, but one that has not yet been systematically tested by molecular genetics. The research plan utilizes contemporary methodologies for the study of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to interrogate the biological function of plant MS ion channels and builds upon previous NASA-funded research into the response of plants to altered gravity environments. We will determine the role played by MS ion channels in mediating gravity signal transduction, their putative roles in adaptation to microgravity; and the molecular mechanisms by which the model MS ion channel MSL10 activates stress-response pathways in plant cells. We expect that these activities will have the following outcomes: 1) Test the long-standing hypothesis that MS ion channels function in gravity perception; 2) Contribute to our basic knowledge regarding how plants exploit MS ion channels to sense and respond to mechanical stress; 3) Provide information that could be used on Earth to improve crop productivity; and 4) Establish a foundation of knowledge required to generate more mechanistic and sophisticated hypotheses about plant gravity perception that can be tested in spaceflight using the European Modular Cultivation System and/or the ABRS GFP Imaging system. (These proposed studies directly address the objectives of the solicitation, as they aim to answer basic questions about how plants respond to changes in gravity and should lead to hypotheses that can be tested on future spaceflights.) <P></td>
