                    <td colspan="3"> This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.    <P>
In a corollary set of experiments, we are utilizing next generation sequencing techniques to assess the effects of long term exposure to radiation on the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in a variety of model systems. The most comprehensive view of this process has come from yeast which, owing to the conservation of this essential pathway, shares homologs of their human DNA repair counterparts. A key observation from our group and others is that different types of DNA damage require unique repair genes and proteins. Accordingly,  we are studying the cellular response to energetic particle radiation experienced in space using whole genome sequencing of thousands of yeast cells exposed to a large matrix of space-specific conditions.      <P>
We hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.     <P>
The proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station (ISS); (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data; (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.    <P>
    <P>
To test our hypothesis, we will:     <P>
1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated microgravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.     <P>
2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated microgravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme that is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.    <P>
3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground-based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This work aims to understand the genetic control mechanism that controls the gene expression response to cellular responses to microgravity in yeast.    <P>
Yeast have 70% homolog with the human genome, and are a useful model system to define primary and secondary drug metabolism pathways that cannot be done in current mammalian cell culture systems.    <P>
The short term aim is to map the genetic promoter elements that mediate gene responses to microgravity. The long term goal is to use this information to unveil drug metabolism pathways in the unique metabolic environment provided by microgravity.    <P>
We propose to establish a sustained genomics platform on the ISS to understand the long term effects of the radiation, and other features of the ISS environment, on crew health by dissecting the essential processes of DNA damage and DNA repair. This has broad Earth benefits in understanding effects and optimization of medically necessary radiation therapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents.    <P>
The APEX-02-2 work  quantitatively measures radiation damage to yeast DNA exposed to space radiation. Using state of the art technologies, the science team can, for the first time, conduct a highly powered, genome wide analysis of mechanisms of radiation damage in space. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating space based radiation damage.    <P>
By using yeast strains to understand the effects of space based radiation stresses at the cellular level, a greater knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms at work in cells will be gained. A hallmark of radiation stresses is that they induce physiological responses; primary among them are DNA damage. As yeast is a model eukaryotic organism, DNA damage changes caused by radiation could lead to a greater understanding of these processes on Earth, thus benefiting all citizens. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating clinical radiation damage.    <P>
Yeast deletion project is a project to create data for a near-complete collection of gene-deletion mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each strain carries a precise deletion of one of the genes in the genome, and has been functionally characterized. We have now cloned the 6,000+ strains of the yeast deletion series into the background of 10 separate deletion clones of genes known to play a major role in responses to radiation damage. <P></td>

						Results and discussion of work completed.    <P>
Preflight studies validated assays for reactive oxygen species and glutathione in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during microgravity simulation; established the timing, optimal media (rich versus poor) and dynamic range of rotational interventions for low redox potential in giant yeast colonies, and determined if lack of convection of gaseous ammonia in true microgravity changes the stratification and expansion of in giant yeast models of differentiation and tumorigenesis.    <P>
Fight definition, flight activities, ground control, and sample recovery are complete. There were zero defects in the SpaceX-11 flight operations and experiment execution.     <P>
Sample processing by DNA extraction, a PCR amplification of reporter barcodes, next generation sequencing, and gene set enrichment analysis are complete. The final Cytoscope/Cluego visualization and probability modeling are ongoing.     <P>
The resources provided have allowed us to address the unifying hypothesis in a sophisticated and nuanced manner, with some important caveats for countermeasures. Our hypothesis is that cells cope with the stress associated with the microgravity of space environment by selectively changing the expression of specific target genes and this response is mediated by defined transcription factors. We have been able to determine specific target genes and mechanistic pathways determining them, including transcription factors, in a variety of space based models using background deletion of several radiation protection genes, as well as stimulation of the system with multiple drugs. In particular, we can now address whether metformin, a drug originally utilized in diabetes, but shown to have cancer protective properties, may be a useful radiation countermeasure. In this manner, the work directly addresses multiple Space Biology Science Plan's research goals, objectives, and guiding questions.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.    <P>
In a corollary set of experiments, we are utilizing next generation sequencing techniques to assess the effects of long term exposure to radiation on the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in a variety of model systems. The most comprehensive view of this process has come from yeast which, owing to the conservation of this essential pathway, shares homologs of their human DNA repair counterparts. A key observation from our group and others is that different types of DNA damage require unique repair genes and proteins. Accordingly,  we are studying the cellular response to energetic particle radiation experienced in space using whole genome sequencing of thousands of yeast cells exposed to a large matrix of space-specific conditions.      <P>
We hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.     <P>
The proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station (ISS); (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data; (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.    <P>
    <P>
To test our hypothesis, we will:     <P>
1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated microgravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.     <P>
2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated microgravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme that is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.    <P>
3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground-based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This work aims to understand the genetic control mechanism that controls the gene expression response to cellular responses to microgravity in yeast.    <P>
Yeast have 70% homolog with the human genome, and are a useful model system to define primary and secondary drug metabolism pathways that cannot be done in current mammalian cell culture systems.    <P>
The short term aim is to map the genetic promoter elements that mediate gene responses to microgravity. The long term goal is to use this information to unveil drug metabolism pathways in the unique metabolic environment provided by microgravity.    <P>
We propose to establish a sustained genomics platform on the ISS to understand the long term effects of the radiation, and other features of the ISS environment, on crew health by dissecting the essential processes of DNA damage and DNA repair. This has broad Earth benefits in understanding effects and optimization of medically necessary radiation therapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents.    <P>
The APEX-02-2 work  quantitatively measures radiation damage to yeast DNA exposed to space radiation. Using state of the art technologies, the science team can, for the first time, conduct a highly powered, genome wide analysis of mechanisms of radiation damage in space. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating space based radiation damage.    <P>
By using yeast strains to understand the effects of space based radiation stresses at the cellular level, a greater knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms at work in cells will be gained. A hallmark of radiation stresses is that they induce physiological responses; primary among them are DNA damage. As yeast is a model eukaryotic organism, DNA damage changes caused by radiation could lead to a greater understanding of these processes on Earth, thus benefiting all citizens. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating clinical radiation damage.    <P>
Yeast deletion project is a project to create data for a near-complete collection of gene-deletion mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each strain carries a precise deletion of one of the genes in the genome, and has been functionally characterized. We have now cloned the 6,000+ strains of the yeast deletion series into the background of 10 separate deletion clones of genes known to play a major role in responses to radiation damage.

                    <td colspan="3"> This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.    <P>
In a corollary set of experiments, we are utilizing next generation sequencing techniques to assess the effects of long term exposure to radiation on the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in a variety of model systems. The most comprehensive view of this process has come from yeast which, owing to the conservation of this essential pathway, shares homologs of their human DNA repair counterparts. A key observation from our group and others is that different types of DNA damage require unique repair genes and proteins. Accordingly,  we are studying the cellular response to energetic particle radiation experienced in space using whole genome sequencing of thousands of yeast cells exposed to a large matrix of space-specific conditions.      <P>
    <P>
    <P>
We hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.     <P>
    <P>
The proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station (ISS); (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data; (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.    <P>
    <P>
To test our hypothesis, we will:     <P>
    <P>
1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated microgravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.     <P>
    <P>
2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated microgravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme that is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.    <P>
    <P>
3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force. <P></td>

Yeast have 70% homolog with the human genome, and are a useful model system to define primary and secondary drug metabolism pathways that cannot be done in current mammalian cell culture systems.    <P>
The short term aim is to map the genetic promoter elements that mediate gene responses to microgravity. The long term goal is to use this information to unveil drug metabolism pathways in the unique metabolic environment provided by microgravity.    <P>
We propose to establish a sustained genomics platform on the ISS to understand the long term effects of the radiation, and other features of the ISS environment, on crew health by dissecting the essential processes of DNA damage and DNA repair. This has broad Earth benefits in understanding effects and optimization of medically necessary radiation therapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents.    <P>
The APEX-02-2 work  quantitatively measures radiation damage to yeast DNA exposed to space radiation.. Using state of the art technologies, the science team can, for the first time, conduct a highly powered, genome wide analysis of mechanisms of radiation damage in space. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating space based radiation damage.    <P>
By using yeast strains to understand the effects of space based radiation stresses at the cellular level, a greater knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms at work in cells will be gained. A hallmark of radiation stresses is that they induce physiological responses; primary among them are DNA damage. As yeast is a model eukaryotic organism, DNA damage changes caused by radiation could lead to a greater understanding of these processes on Earth, thus benefiting all citizens. Knowledge gained from this investigation will build upon previous data to understanding the mechanisms of radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating clinical radiation damage. <P></td>

						In the first phase of this project wildtype and radiation sensitive stains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were flown in space and where resident on the ISS for 30 and 180 days before recovery (SpaceX4 and SpaceX6). We used 100 independent yeast strains to survey the effects of radiation on this model organism, and collected whole genome sequence data for 1000 genomes on space-based and ground controls. This cohort comprises 100 individual strains, 90 of which contain verified deletion alleles in a variety of conserved pathways including MEC1, MRE11, and RAD4, 5, 7, 18, 24, 27, 27, and RAD51 mutants, encoding essential proteins including checkpoint kinases, helicases, nucleases, and ligases. These 1000 genomes provide a baseline spectrum of mutations against which we will calibrate additional experimental samples. As a testament to the robustness of this platform, a replicate set of samples originally intended to return on SpaceX4 after 30 days of exposure actually remained on the ISS for 180 days, returning on SpaceX6. This allowed us to double the size of our data set and provided insight into the effects of long-term exposure.    <P>
The yeast libraries were constructed and sequencing is complete. Early analysis of the results has been reported in abstract form. We are dissecting the essential processes of DNA damage and DNA repair. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of thousands of strains collected over hundreds of generations has uncovered space-specific vulnerabilities, and pathway analysis is allowing analysis of known and novel radiation sensitive pathways. The data sets will be publicly accessible on open-source, community databases including Genelab, as soon as current analysis is complete.    <P>
Beginning in 2005, developments in massively parallel sequencing Next Generation Sequencing or NGS changed the way in which DNA sequencing was performed.  This revolutionized the field of genomics by delivering a complete human genome sequences in a fraction of the time (days versus years) and at a fraction of the cost (thousands of dollars versus billions of dollars).  No aspect of life sciences has been untouched by this revolution and new fields have emerged, such as ecological genomics, microbiome genomics, and personalized genomics. The microbiome (all the microbes present in diverse body sites) is becoming a key diagnostic of the health of the host. Epi-genomics, the study of DNA modifications, including those that promote serious diseases, is now possible, as are the delineation of complex traits that can determine susceptibility to disease and offer insights on treatment.    <P>
The recent Decadal Survey Report, “Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era,” by the National Research Council  ( <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13048">http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13048</a>  ), specifically mentions the need for NASA to utilize new Omics research technologies.  The biologic effects of radiation in space continue to pose a challenge to space exploration and Omics may provide useful new tools to apply to this problem.    <P>
The aim of the second stage of this project is to fly a yeast payload to understand the molecular mechanisms of radiation damage, and whether radiation repair mechanisms have unique aspects in space. Multiple genome-wide series of deletion clones will be assayed to study the genomics of radiation effects. We propose to return the yeast arrays from space and analyze the DNA by next generation sequencing and make comparison to ground controls. Pathway analysis will then allow analysis of known and novel radiation sensitive pathways. The data sets will be placed on publicly accessible websites, including GeneLab, as a community resource.     <P>
Phase I of the experiments validated the use of high-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) to assess the effects of long term exposure to radiation using the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In our experience, 100 unique deletion alleles will provide a robust dataset for reconstructing pathways that are both directly and indirectly involved in the cells resistance to radiation damage.    <P>
Multiple genome-wide series of ~4,800 deletion clones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae of “Baker’s yeast” has been prepared for use in the reflight. To translate this study data to clinical and space health countermeasures, 10 new deletion series have been created with a second putative control genes also deleted.  That is, ten yeast strains have been constructed by genetic deletion, each lacking a putative radiation repair control gene. The entire yeast deletion series of ~4,800 deletion clones is re-derived using the strains with putative control gene deletion as the background strain in which all other deletions are constructed, resulting in genome wide pools of double deletion strains. This fresh approach aims to determine the molecular mechanisms of radiation damage to facilitate understanding radiation damage, and may provide simple approaches to ameliorating space based and clinical radiation damage. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.    <P>
In a corollary set of experiments, we are utilizing next generation sequencing techniques to assess the effects of long term exposure to radiation on the yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in a variety of model systems. The most comprehensive view of this process has come from yeast which, owing to the conservation of this essential pathway, shares homologs of their human DNA repair counterparts. A key observation from our group and others is that different types of DNA damage require unique repair genes and proteins. Accordingly,  we are studying the cellular response to energetic particle radiation experienced in space using whole genome sequencing of thousands of yeast cells exposed to a large matrix of space-specific conditions.      <P>
    <P>
    <P>
We hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.     <P>
    <P>
The proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station (ISS); (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data; (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.    <P>
    <P>
To test our hypothesis, we will:     <P>
    <P>
1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated microgravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.     <P>
    <P>
2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated microgravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme that is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.    <P>
    <P>
3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force. <P></td>

The short term aim is to map the genetic promoter elements that mediate gene responses to microgravity. The long term goal is to use this information to unveil drug metabolism pathways in the unique metabolic environment provided by microgravity.    <P>

						Our laboratory has used both wild type yeast and the systematic yeast deletion collection to assign gene function and to understand the effect of over 3000 environmental stresses on how genotype influences phenotype. We have defined the organismal response to diverse genotoxic stresses, including drug-induced DNA damage as well as the effect of diverse types of radiation damage. These screens have i) identified genes in well-characterized DNA-damage-response pathways and ii) genes whose role in the DNA-damage response had not been previously established. Each DNA damaging treatment produced a unique genome-wide profile or “signature” and bioinformatic clustering of the data allowed us to define the genetic determinants required for diverse types of damage.     <P>
In the first phase of this project (SpaceX4 and SpaceX6) we used 100 independent yeast strains to survey the effects of radiation on this model organism, and collected whole genome sequence data for 1000 genomes on space-based and ground controls. This cohort comprises 100 individual strains, 90 of which contain verified deletion alleles in a variety of conserved pathways including MEC1, MRE11, and RAD4, 5, 7, 18, 24, 27, 27, and RAD51 mutants, encoding essential proteins including checkpoint kinases, helicases, nucleases, and ligases. These 1000 genomes provide a baseline spectrum of mutations against which we will calibrate additional experimental samples. As a testament to the robustness of this platform, a replicate set of samples originally intended to return on SpaceX4 after 30 days of exposure actually remained on the ISS for 180 days, returning on SpaceX6. This allowed us to double the size of our dataset and provided insight into the effects of long-term exposure.    <P>
The yeast libraries have been constructed and sequencing is ongoing. Early results are available for analysis and being studied. We are dissecting the essential processes of DNA damage and DNA repair.  Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of thousands of strains collected over hundreds of generations should uncover space-specific vulnerabilities, and pathway analysis will allow analysis of known and novel radiation sensitive pathways. The data sets will be publicly assessable on an open-source, community database, as soon as current analysis is complete. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.     <P>
    <P>
We hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.     <P>
    <P>
The proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station; (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data; (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.    <P>
    <P>
To test our hypothesis, we will:     <P>
    <P>
1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated micro gravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.     <P>
    <P>
2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated microgravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme which is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.    <P>
    <P>
3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force. <P></td>

						The initial proposed approach using the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) was aborted due to irreconcilable problems with the ABRS hardware.  To regain the science, a conjoint decision was made by NASA administration and the science team to utilize the plate reader on ISS to measure the kinetics of gene expression.  A second plate reader was acquired for ground controls.  Static and clino-rotated controls were successfully executed in the plate readers, although the rotating plate reader showed some orientation dependence of readings. At this time we amended the research plan to expand the science.  Rather than discard the yeast samples after fluorescent gene expression analysis on ISS, it was proposed that the plates be returned and the yeast analyzed for radiation damage. To optimize the yield of information from this appended protocol, we included thirty clones of yeast bearing mutations that affect their sensitivity to radiation.  Unfortunately, the plate reader on ISS was unable to maintain temperature or collect fluorescence data in the manner needed.  Thus we were unable to complete the primary goal of analyzing the genetic response of yeast to spaceflight.    However, it was possible to proceed with the amended protocol to study radiation damage.  Four plates were returned in the Dragon capsule on May 2014 and five plates remain on the ISS to  be returned at a later date. The radiation sensitive clones samples from ground and flight sets are currently being sequenced using next generation sequencing techniques. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.     <P>
    <P>
We hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.     <P>
    <P>
The proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station; (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data, (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.    <P>
    <P>
To test our hypothesis, we will:     <P>
    <P>
1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated micro gravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.     <P>
    <P>
2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated micro gravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme which is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.    <P>
    <P>
3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force. <P></td>

						Logistics. Regulatory documents were prepared in support of the mission including the experiment requirements document (ERD), Phase A package elements, and Science Verification Test (SVT) Plan.    <P>
The science verification test for APEX-02 was performed from October 28, 2012 through November 10, 2012 in the Space Life Sciences Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center. ABRS was housed in an Orbital Environmental Simulator (OES) throughout the experiments.    <P>
Ten centimeter square Petri dishes were prepared with 15 ml of low fluorescent agarose in the base. A library of green fluorescent protein linked clones of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were prepared robotically. The clones were robotically spotted in the Banting and Best labs of the Donnelly Center at the University of Toronto as a direct purchase of services.      <P>
Three types of plates were spotted. The first plate type had the same GFP clone spotted on every site to prepare a light intensity matrix to allow correction for non-uniformity of illumination. To determine dynamic range a series of promoter driven clones were prepared with GFP intensities at log steps across 6 orders of magnitude. Each clone was spotted as 4 spots in a square, and this was repeated on different areas of the plate. The third type of plate was spotted with GFP clones from the GFP clone library (32 X 32 x 3 different plates = 3,072 clones). This represented three of the ten GFP-clone library plates proposed to be flown: all ten will be assayed in the PVT.    <P>
For each plate (controls and GFP clone library) white and GFP images were collected at 10 minute intervals for 30 hours (300 images per plate).    <P>
Light intensity.    <P>
The light setting on the ABRS can be set from 1 to 100% in 1% increments. To determine the optimal light setting a GFP-clone spotted plate was placed in the ABRS and white and GFP images collect at 10% light intensity intervals. Higher light intensities (100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, and 20%) resulted in complete white out of the GFP image. At 10% a sharp image was obtained. At1 % the GFP image was completely black. Following further iteration of images between 1 and 20% light intensity it was determined that light intensities of 7% and below were a complete blackout. Light intensities between 8 and 11% gave crisp images, and we settled on 9% so as not to be on the margin of loss of image. White light and GFP image intensity is linked, and the white light images were also crisp at 9% light intensity.     <P>
Focal length, image flattening and quantitation of data.    <P>
Agarose plates mist the plate cover with quite small changes in temperature, such as transfer from refrigerator to ABRS. The misting was dealt with by three modalities: (1) minimizing the about of agarose poured in the plates to reduce total water load present; (2) pausing for temperature equilibration during transfer; and (3) placing the agarose side, not the lid of the plate towards the camera. Using 15 ml of pored agarose per plate, transfer delays of as little as 60 seconds between temperatures greatly reduced, but did not abolish misting of the lid. When translucent low fluorescent agarose was used, the agarose containing Petri dish bottom could be placed towards the camera and images taken through the agarose were crisp and clear independent of misting. This bottom to camera plate positioning solved the temperature dependent misting problem as the spots were clearly seen, and proved to be in the focal length of the camera.     <P>
Review of the company literature on the light sources, and measures provided by John Lane from the Engineering team demonstrated that both the white light and blue light fluorescent excitation were non-linear. To correct for non-linear light images were taken of the control plate with the same GFP-expressing clone spotted in every position. The images were converted to .tiff format, and uploaded into NIH ImageJ software. Not only could be the images be corrected for the non-linearity, but the fluorescent and white images could be converted to numerical measures of intensity, and the data exported.    <P>
Dynamic range and reproducibility.    <P>
To determine dynamic range a series of promoter driven clones with GFP intensities at log steps across 6 orders of magnitude were spotted and imaged. As shown in the image below, even by eye the reproducibility of groups of 4 identical clones, and full availability of a broad dynamic range is visible.    <P>
The camera direction and placement can be modified in ABRS. The image shows that we lost up to 2 edge rows of spots. Now that we know we have more than adequate resolution we will move the spots further away from all edges for the PVT. This will allow for a forgiving range of camera placements, as we cannot be certain of the camera placement on the ABRS unit resident on the ISS.    <P>
GFP clones.    <P>
For each of plate (controls and GFP clone library) white and GFP images were collected at 10 minute intervals for 30 hours (180 images per plate) without incident. The data storage chip was changed out daily at the same time that the plate was changed out.    <P>
There were no incidents or problems collecting the data. The ability to collect 180 images is a quantum leap forward, as the quantity of pathway analysis and identification of genetic control elements (Gibbs promoter analysis) is directly proportional to the volume of data available for analysis. In situ repeat measurements largely solves the problems of variability between samples, and allows sophisticated genetic analysis without the necessity for a large payload.    <P>
Rotating controls and Colony Doc-IT.     <P>
In addition to static ground based controls it is instructive to have a rotating control, as a ground based simulation of some of the elements of microgravity (randomization of the gravity vector).  To this end, the SVT experiments were run in parallel, in the ABRS and in a Colony Doc-It manufactured by UVP (shown in image).  The Colony Doc-It™ imaging station visualizes white light and GFP fluorescent colonies and records a plate image as a .tiff image. A Macro was written, and the Colony Doc-It was programmed to   automatically take GFP fluorescent images at the same frequency as ABRS. A white light image was taken by manual sliding of the GFP filter out of the pathway of light collection at the start and end of the image stack. The data automatically downloads to a dedicated portable computer as a .tiff file for analysis in ImageJ software.    <P>
Working with Dr. Dave Reed the Clino-7 clinostat, which will accommodate a locker sized payload, has been modified to hold and rotate the Colony Doc-It and dedicated computer. This will allow for parallel rotating controls for the PVT and flight mission, in addition to static ground based controls. The entire Clino-7, Colony Doc-It , and computer assembly will be placed in an OES for temperature and humidity control.    <P>
It was clear that the resolution of the Colont-Doc was limiting for the analysis of ground based clinostat controls for this project. Hence, the plan was evolved to use a state-of-the-art M5e Molecular Devices plate reader, identical to the one on the International Space Station, which has at least an order of magnitude better sensitivity. As the cost of this equipment was far beyond the scope of the current grant, a separate and distance shared equipment program grant was submitted to the VA office of Research and Development. The application was funded and the equipment utilized in the following payload verification tests. Molecular devices graciously provided a loaner instrument so we could directly compare the yeast genetic response over time static and clinorotated physical environments. One plate reader was static on the lab bench, and the other rotated 2X per minute in a clinostat. Images were taken every 10 minutes for 18 hours. Ten plates accommodated study of one copy of each clone in the yeast genome. The data is currently being used to optimize pathways analysis, whether from ground based static, clino, or flight data.    <P>
A fresh GFP yeast clone library and control plates were robotically spotted for a payload verification test scheduled to start on February 10, 2013. Due to problems with salt coating of the ABRS instrumentation this test was postponed.    <P>
A fresh GFP yeast clone library and control plates were robotically spotted for a payload verification test performed on July 20, 2013 through August 3, 2013. This PVT was characterized by challenges in image quality, with degradation of the data.     <P>
Repairs to the ABRS are planned, and a third PVT tentatively scheduled for October 7 through 18, 2013, premised on successful repair of the imager and associated ABRS hardware.    <P>
Conclusions.    <P>
1.	Use of the Advanced Biological Research System for the new application of imaging GFP gene expression linked yeast analysis has been optimized for light intensity, plate placement, and image flattening.  Dynamic range, reproducibility, image conversion, and data quantification have been validated.    <P>
2.	A rotating simulated microgravity control system has been developed for validation during the PVT.    <P>
3.	PVT needs repetition once ABRS hardware repairs are successfully in place.   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This application investigates microbial growth and physiological responses to the multiple stimuli encountered in space flight environments, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Yeast are an ideal model because their complete gene sequence is known; there are extensive and sophisticated clone libraries available for study; and they can easily be flown in space, held at +4oC in a quiescent state, and activated by simple warming. Regulatory mechanisms in yeast are highly similar to mammalian cells. We have shown that microgravity activates a unique set of genes in yeast, but the specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined.     <P>
    <P>
We hypothesize that by identifying specific regulatory motifs within the promoter regions of microgravity-responsive genes, we will be able to determine transcription factors that bind the motifs, and thus the signaling pathways involved in microbial growth and physiological responses. We propose ground-based studies with transition to a future flight experiment, designed so as to have a high probability of obtaining genome wide data.     <P>
    <P>
The proposed experiments are timely because (a) recent improvements in promoter analysis have vastly increased the accuracy of promoter elements predictions; (b) novel yeast clones allow direct measurement of gene expression by fluorescence using the plate reader in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) that is already in place on the International Space Station; (c) yeast on agar plates can be assayed repetitively, thereby eliminating sample to sample variability to increasing the statistical power of the data, (d) new reagents allow design of experiments with minimal up mass (less than 2 kg); and (e) all data can be returned by telemetry, eliminating the need for down mass.    <P>
    <P>
To test our hypothesis, we will:     <P>
    <P>
1) Identify promoter motifs associated with genes responding to Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV)-emulated microgravity compared to static cultures. The RWV will be used to emulate microgravity as we have already demonstrated that it induces changes in yeast gene expression that are similar to those of yeast flown in space.  The Yeast Green Fluorescent Protein clone collection will permit identification, by changes in fluorescence, of genes whose expression changes in response to real and simulated micro gravity. After extensive normalization and analytic procedures, microgravity-responsive genes will be grouped into clusters on the basis of similar kinetics, under the assumption that these are likely to be co-regulated.  We will then search the upstream sequence of co-expressed genes and identify candidate binding motifs for transcription factors.     <P>
    <P>
2) Confirm the role of regulatory sequences in directly activating transcription of a set of genes changed by RWV-simulated micro gravity and to identify transcription factors that interact with these regulatory motifs. This specific aim makes novel use of the yeast deletion collection, a systematic gene-by-gene set of complete gene deletions, the only such resource that exists for any group of organisms. Transcription factors will be identified by robotically introducing a reporter plasmid that codes for 1) a suicide-inducing enzyme which is activated in all clones except the one(s) with a deletion in the gene for the transcription activating factor that binds to the promoter motif or 2) an endogenously activated essential gene to identify repressors.    <P>
    <P>
3) Confirm and extend the results obtained in our ground based studies on the selective growth pressure in the true microgravity environment.  Utilizing the genome wide yeast GFP clone collections spotted on agar plates, we propose a parallel flight study. Our question can ultimately only be definitively answered in the true microgravity of space, because on the ground gravity must always be onset with an equal and opposite force. <P></td>
