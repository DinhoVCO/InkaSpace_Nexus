                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) (more recently known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:     <P>
1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles). This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.     <P>
2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.     <P>
Prior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities. <P></td>

						Intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) are among the top health risks associated with long-term space travel. It has been proposed that in microgravity, fluids redistribute, increasing both ICP and OCP leading to visual impairment (VI) after spaceflight. Our original proposal aimed to test the hypothesis that space microgravity increases the proliferation of human neural stem cells (NSCs) and oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), as we previously found using simulated microgravity.    <P>
This has been an inspirational journey; the Bioscience-4 research project consisted of two spaceflights. Using normal human brain cells, we explored cell division and maintenance of pluripotency for NSCs (the precursors of all cell types that form the brain and spinal cord). We examined the molecules they produced while in the Space Station and their behavior after spaceflight once we brought them back to Earth. Besides studying NSCs, we also ascertained the impact of spaceflight on OLPs, their survival in flight and post-flight, and the specific features that changed in the profile of molecules secreted by them while in space. We also examined their behavior post-flight.    <P>
Here we report great news: both cell types (NSCs and OLPs), survived the roundtrip and preserved their inherent properties. In the case of NSCs, they continued to “self-renew” after spaceflight, remaining pluripotent. This is important because NSCs give rise to neurons for learning and memory in the brain. This augurs well for a healthy brain in our astronauts, ensuring normal cognition and behavior. NSCs also generated astrocytes, one type of glial cell in charge of maintaining the function of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The second cell type we sent to space, “oligodendrocytes”, which are the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system (CNS), also survived and kept their properties in terms of proliferation (cell division) and expression of specific markers, confirming that they remained functional. We found that most cells sent to space remained normal, with the main difference of giving rise to more progenies than those kept in Earth’s gravity.    <P>
We also compared the molecules secreted by space (SPC)-flown NSCs and OLPs vs. those produced by their ground control counterparts (GC). We were surprised to see that, in general, changes were not as numerous as we expected; several pathways yielded very similar results between GC vs. space-flown cells, indicating that microgravity did not alter the cells’ natural properties. This is also reassuring for long-term space missions to the Moon and Mars. For other pathways, differences were small but significant regarding the abundance of proteins and small molecules between GC and space samples. Both the proteomics and metabolomics analyses allowed us to identify enhanced energetics activity in both NSCs and OLPs that flew to space. Such an increase in energy demands might be caused by cell proliferation. We are happy to report that the defense mechanisms of our cells were in place and responded adequately. For example, typical indicators of cellular stress are the increased expression of stress proteins, also known as heat shock proteins. Although they indicate cellular stress, these proteins are in charge of clearing misfolded proteins, allowing the cell to recover from the stress and synthesize normal proteins for their function. In other words, they indicate the activation of different mechanisms supporting survival and homeostasis in response to the stress produced by spaceflight.    <P>
We also found a decreased expression of proteins involved in visual function. Transthyretin (TTR) was reduced 4.6, and Calmodulin-2 decreased by 6.1 times in the SPC-NSCs secretome. The most significantly associated pathways include the metabolism of vitamins and cofactors related to visual phototransduction. These findings are important in that, by addressing these changes, visual functions can be maintained. Identifying these changes is just the first step towards mitigating or reversing them.    <P>
We also found a modest but significant increase in autophagy (paper in preparation), and a fraction of these cells presented larger size, all mechanisms reminiscent of the development of the CNS. Thus, it is not always abnormal, but somewhat necessary to find these behaviors in some cells, particularly when adapting to a different environment.  It is important to note that, at present, we interpret these changes as “stress responses” because nobody has defined how to start identifying “non-stress” changes when referring to cellular responses specific to weightlessness or other gravitational changes. Considering the enormous difference between Earth’s gravity and microgravity, these differences may be suitable and normal. The changes observed by us and others studying life cells exposed to microgravity could also be transient and necessary to maintain both function and homeostasis in the brain. Within their context, they might be considered “normal and necessary” for a healthy transition from Earth’s gravity to different gravity – such as space, the Moon, or Mars.    <P>
As expected in all pioneer work, our study has some inherent limitations. Although we primarily focused on the effects of microgravity/spaceflight on NSCs and OLPs, other factors may contribute to the changes we observed. Therefore, future studies will have to examine the effects of radiation on both cell types’ proliferation and growth in our SPC-cells when compared to ground controls. For example, it is worth mentioning that experimental studies have shown that high atomic number energy (HZE) nuclei produce both qualitative and quantitative differences in biological effects compared to terrestrial radiation, leading to uncertainty in predicting exposure to health outcomes in humans. Despite all the unknowns, we feel that the key to the modulation of pathways and cell interactions may reside in the changes we observed. Nonetheless, the future for humankind in space appears bright as our work, and that of many other scientists, are identifying molecules and pathways as targets to design preventive measures and countermeasures for our current, future, and past astronauts. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) (more recently known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:     <P>
1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles). This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.     <P>
2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.     <P>
Prior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities. <P></td>

						We examined by continuous live imaging the behavior of space flown neural stem cells (NSCs). We found two cell sub-populations in the cultures of space (SPC)-flown NSCs, distinguished by differences in cell diameter. We also found two subpopulations in ground control (GC) cells. Nonetheless, the effect SPC-µG resulted in a shift of both sub-populations. The small and large NSCs grown in Earth gravity were evenly distributed; large NSCs accounted for 49.2% and small NSCs represented 50.8% of the entire population. In contrast, the proportion of cells included in each group shifted after exposure to SPC-µG, where large cells represented 81% of the total number of cells while the percentage of small NSCs had decreased to 19%. Thus, our study shows that SPC-µG generated a greater proportion of 'large' NSCs than ground control cells. This study is significant to astronauts’ health because it shows for the first time that SPC-µG increase the proportion of “large” NSCs after space flight. Moreover, space flight also increased the proliferation of NSCs when compared to ground control cells, testing our hypothesis that microgravity generates more cells than Earth gravity. Understanding the effects of microgravity on neural cells will facilitate the design of measures to ensure astronaut health and safety on longer space missions and whilst at the International Space Station (ISS) and beyond. To better understand these changes, we examined the molecules secreted by the cells while in space. A total of 119 differentially expressed proteins were identified by analysis of the secretome of NSCs, 86 upregulated in SPC-NSCs/GC-NSCs and 34 downregulated. From those, 37 upregulated proteins have a fold change = 2 and 5 downregulated proteins a fold change = -2. The changes involved proteins implicated in activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, Secreted Protein Acidic and Cysteine Rich (SPARC), Calreticulin (CALR), and Endoplasmin (HSP90B1), which were found to be 12.8, 5.2, and 3.3 times, respectively, more expressed in SPC-NSCs than GC-NSCs. We are in the process of analyzing how the protein changes co-relate with the physical changes observed in terms of cell size.    <P>
From SpaceX CRS-21 (SpX-21), we published our first paper. Main Findings: We saw that oligodendrocytes, the cells that make and maintain myelin through the life of the organism, displayed a more immature morphology and ontogenic profile with respect to ground control cells. This phenomenon was previously observed in simulated microgravity.  Since these studies were performed after space flight, they indicate that oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitors (OLPs) remember having been in space. While we do not know if these changes occur in the natural milieu of the entire brain where various cell populations co-exist, having immature OLs  may lead to some myelin loss. This would lead to cognitive and mechanical changes due to myelin loss. More studies are necessary before one can reach any conclusions. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) (more recently known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:     <P>
1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles). This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.     <P>
2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.     <P>
Prior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities. <P></td>

						Intracranial pressure (ICP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) are among the top health risks associated with long-term space travel. It has been proposed that in microgravity fluids redistribute increasing both ICP and OCP leading to visual impairment (VI) after space flight. The purpose of Aim II of our original proposal was to test the hypothesis that space microgravity increases the proliferation of human NSC as we previously found using simulated microgravity.     <P>
In spite of the vicissitudes generated by the COVID19 pandemic such as restricted number of people authorized to access our facilities, restricted use of equipment, and space and decreased time for microscope use, we are happy to report that we published two new peer-reviewed papers. We have shown that human neural stem cells (NSCs) after space flight gave rise to a glial cell type in the central nervous system, i.e., astrocytes (Published data in paper #1 cited below). We also tested our hypothesis that NSCs, proliferate more while in space and continue to do so after space flight (data reported in paper #2 below). These data confirm our previous finding from 2013, obtained using simulated microgravity produced by a 3D-clinostat. These results confirmed that NSCs preserve both their stemness and capacity to differentiate into a specific glial cell type after space flight when provided with adequate conditions. In other words, they were inducible to this glial phenotype.    <P>
We also examined by continuous live imaging the behavior of space flown NSCs. We found two cell sub-populations in the cultures of space (SPC)-flown NSCs, distinguished by differences in cell diameter. We also found two subpopulations in ground control cells. Nonetheless, the effect SPC-µG resulted in a shift of both sub-populations. The small and large NSCs grown in Earth gravity were evenly distributed, large NSCs accounted for 49.2% and small NSCs represented 50.8% of the entire population. In contrast, the proportion of cells included in each group shifted after exposure to SPC-µG, where large cells represented 81% of the total number of cells while the percentage of small NSCs had decreased to 19%. Thus, our study shows that SPC-µG generated a greater proportion of 'large' NSCs than ground control cells.    <P>
This study is significant to astronauts’ health because it shows for the first time that SPC-µG increases the proportion of “large” human NSCs. Moreover, space flight also increased the proliferation of NSCs when compared to ground control cells testing our hypothesis--that microgravity generates more cells than Earth gravity. Understanding the effects of microgravity on neural cells will facilitate the design of measures to ensure astronaut health and safety on longer space missions and whilst at the International Space Station (ISS) and beyond.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) (more recently known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:     <P>
1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles). This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.     <P>
2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.     <P>
Prior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities. <P></td>

						Last year we published our first paper from the study of NSCs after spaceflight and we demonstrated that they could be induced to the neuronal phenotype. They gave rise to young neurons.    <P>
This year, we found that NSCs after spaceflight  gave rise to astrocytes; they are a glial cell type in the central nervous system. These results confirmed that NSCs preserve their stemness after spaceflight and that in adequate conditions they were inducible to this glial phenotype.    <P>
The proteomics analysis is currently being performed.    <P>
Long Term travel and lengthy stays for astronauts in outer space are imminent. To date, more than 500 astronauts have experienced the extreme conditions of spaceflight including microgravity and radiation. Here we report that human neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferated more while in space (SPC) when compared to on Earth (1G) control cultures. We also examined by continuous live imaging the behavior of space flown NSCs. We found that after spaceflight they continued proliferating. Interestingly, NSCs flown to space displayed a larger diameter than control cells. This is a novel and surprising finding because we have found that NSCs after having been exposed to simulated microgravity were smaller. Both phenomena, increased proliferation while in space and larger cell soma after spaceflight, may contribute to intracranial hypertension found in astronauts, representing a risk factor and potential limitation to long duration space missions such as travelling to the Moon and Mars. We expect to publish two more manuscripts this year. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) (more recently known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:     <P>
1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles). This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.     <P>
2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.     <P>
Prior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities. <P></td>

Pre-flight operations    <P>
At UCLA: Labels for cultures and reagents/growth factors’ aliquots were prepared and printed at the Principal Investigator's (PI’s) laboratory. Two cases containing items that were essential for flight implementation were sent to the Cape. Culture media was prepared and sent frozen. Stocks of frozen cells and two sets of growing cultures were also sent to Kennedy Space Center (KSC).    <P>
PI activities at the Kennedy Space Center: The PI worked with STaARS from scratch in preparation for flight integration because the STaARs team members were different from those participating in the ERD and Experimental Verification Tests (EVT). The Airbus-Kiwi team joined us at KSC for flight implementation and handover was timely and without incident. Cells stayed 39.3 days in space followed by splash-down and transfer to the PI laboratory. The PI had everything ready and de-integration of the flight was performed. Human oligodendrocytes and  neural stem cells (NSCs) were recovered from the flying devices and seeded for further studies. The secretome was collected and placed in their respective tubes for both metabolomics and proteomics. Cultures were fed to evaluate their viability and health status. Oxygen consumption and glycolysis (anaerobic respiration) were determined and data collected.  NSCs recovered faster from spaceflight. Oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) did not respond well to extended and repeated exposure to room temperature. Thus, OLPs were recovered in scarce numbers. In addition, events inherent to this specific spaceflight led to the need of two supplementary experiments. The PI performed the ground control implementation and supplementary experiments in a concomitant manner.    <P>
This is an ongoing study and the secretome has been processed to examine the protein contents and metabolites.  Data analysis will start in September, 2019.     <P>
We gladly report that NSCs coming back from space preserved their stemness including cell renewal and potential to give rise to neurons. OLPs that survived after spaceflight also gave rise to healthy progenies. These OLPs generated by OLPs flown to space present characteristics very close to those shown by ground control OL.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:     <P>
1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA. This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.     <P>
2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.     <P>
Prior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities. <P></td>

						The Impact of Real Microgravity on Neural Stem Cells and Oligodendrocyte Progenitors: Ground based experiments: Preflight Assessments     <P>
Project Objectives: The goals of this project include determining proliferation rates of human neural stem cells (NSCs) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OLPs also known as OPCs), both in microgravity. To perform this experiment, cells will fly to and remain on the ISS for a 30-day term. These cells have several growth constraints including atmospheric composition (i.e., CO2 and O2 concentrations) and temperature. We shall also examine the secretome of these progenitors after exposure to real microgravity. Previously, using OLs the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system CNS), OSM (oligodendrocyte specification medium) a chemically defined medium designed by us (Espinosa et al., 2009; 2016a), and a 3D-Clinostat we subjected these cells to sim-0G and found enhanced and sustained proliferation, with a concomitant shortening of the cell cycle. We have also observed some other significant changes in biological processes, including oxygen consumption rates, that are enhanced in OLPs exposed to sim-0G (for details see previous report and Espinosa et al., 2013). Moreover, these cells also secrete numerous fatty acids and more complex lipids in just three days while this was not observed in 1G sister cultures (Espinosa et al., 2016b).    <P>
Year 4 Report    <P>
Experimental Verification Tests (EVT): This year we performed the Experimental Verification Tests (EVT) that are the last step to be accomplished before getting authorization for flight implementation.  The EVT activities were started at the end of December 2017 and continued until January 13, 2018. Data was collected from cells kept up to 51 days in the spaceflight containers in the specific conditions that our neural cells will experience during ascent, on board of the International Space Station and during descent/re-entry and splash-down.    <P>
We used various methods to ascertain the viability and performance of both cell types, neural stem cells (NSC) and oligodendrocytes (OLs) the cells that make and maintain myelin in the central nervous system (CNS).  These tests were performed for both cell types and using both types of hardware: passive and automated. Light microscopy was used to determine cell morphology and events such as proliferation and maturation of the cells prior to starting the experiment and upon conclusion of the “travel and incubation times.”    <P>
We have previously reported that OLs consume more energy in simulated microgravity when compared to cells maintained in 1G, i.e., terrestrial gravity.    <P>
Energetic status of our cells: We selected the SeaHorse Bioscience assay because it is an ideal quantitative indicator of the metabolic state of the cells; for example, if the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is deficient the cells might not be in optimal conditions.     <P>
The use of antibodies to identify specific cell marker expression and typical stage-specific markers together with cell morphology are very helpful techniques to establish the developmental stage of the cells. We examined the cells after each time point from 45 to 55 days unattended using fluorescent microscopy.    <P>
We also ascertained the amount of protein contained in the culture medium alone and the one contained proteins secreted by the cells “secretome” in order to ensure that we would have enough protein per container for the proteomics study.    <P>
Results    <P>
•	Human oligodendrocyte progenitors HuOLPs survive well unattended for up to 51 days and recover well in our optimized OLs culture medium.    <P>
•	NSCs survived well 51 days unattended and recovered fast upon being back to 37degreesC in fresh medium as assessed by the Energetics, morphological and fluorescent expression of cell markers.    <P>
•	The secretome of both passive and active units contained enough protein for our study.    <P>
•	In order to protect the samples prior to re-entry to the atmosphere, we have to arrest the growth of the cells. We tested fixative and RNAlater in order to elucidate if these substances are compatible with immunofluorescent detection of surface and internal cell markers.    <P>
•	RNAlater is compatible with protein detection and quantification in the secretome of our cells.    <P>
Understanding CNS changes elicited by exposure to real microgravity may lead us to address disturbances such as intracranial hypertension experienced by astronauts in space and/or upon return to Earth.    <P>
In summary    <P>
Experiments were finished in a successful manner. On these bases “success criteria for specific parameters were established.”    <P>
In parallel we worked on the “EXPERIMENT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT” that is necessary to provide details about the requirements for our cells while at the Cape, during ascent, descent, and while in the ISS.    <P>
We are ready since March 2018, as our cells were supposed to fly in SpaceX-14 on April 2, 2018.  However, a malfunction of the STaARS-1 Platform prompted re-scheduling the flight of our cells to November 29, 2018 in Space X-16.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:     <P>
1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA. This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.     <P>
2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.     <P>
Prior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities. <P></td>

						Last year we published our finding on the effects simulated-0G on the myelin forming cells in the brain and spinal cord, oligodendrocytes (OLs). Human OLs exposed 3 days to simulated microgravity confirmed a significant increase in energy needs as determined by two markers where glucose and pyruvate levels decreased in 0G cultures, but not in 1G (control cultures). A concomitant increase in lactate also confirmed that in 0G, OLs had to recur to glycolysis (anoxic respiration) to meet their energy demands while 1G OLs did not show this behavior.    <P>
This year was very busy and very exciting; we characterized the methodology to increase the surface of cell adhesion in our containers by using a polyester mesh that is cell compatible and can be autoclaved. We have shown that our cells adhere strongly but in a dynamic manner, cells migrate along the mesh fibers and fill the spaces between threads organizing themselves in a tri-dimensional manner.    <P>
On July 2017 we were asked to add four more time points to our study in order to ascertain if the cells would be healthy up to 55 days. We tested the viability and performance of cells after being 40 days unattended and they were healthy, giving rise to progenies and metabolically active as shown by performing the same type of energetics reported in our publication (Espinosa et al., 2016). Cells seeded in the space-like containers for the subsequent time points are still in the incubator, the same type of study will be performed.    <P>
On July 2017 we were trained by members of our commercial partner STaARS on how to assemble the Automated Type IV containers in which our cells will fly to space. Cells are currently growing in these units.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>

Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space.

						We have determined the temperatures at which our cells will be healthy (between 31°C and 37°C) while in the space station. We also performed other studies to define gas conditions to be used during the spaceflight as follows: We tested different oxygen concentration (most commonly used) and we determined that we shall use 21% Oxygen (O2) content in our cell culture medium prior to plating the cells and enclosing the containers. Lower oxygen concentrations decrease performance of our cells. We examined representative gene expression for our cells and found that in 1G and in simulated microgravity, the genes expressed weren't altered by microgravity.    <P>
We now await for training to learn how to operate the automated containers. We are almost ready for the spaceflight and are extremely happy about this project. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological, and anatomical changes as well as intracranial pressure (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station (ISS) spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.    <P>
Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aim I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
Aim II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.    <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the central nervous system (CNS).     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C, and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To date, there is no cure for developmental disabilities, neurodegenerative disorders, myelin loss, or cancer. We expect that our work described in the current proposal will generate cures that are of paramount importance in two different but complementary fields:     <P>
1) Drug discovery: The first product will be the first molecule that would have been identified, isolated, and tested to be responsible for increased cell proliferation. This will open the door for a second product (or series of products) under this category that would be an antibody or similar molecule(s) that would void/neutralize the effects of the first molecule on cell proliferation. This second product will be further studied as an anti-cancer agent via prevention of cell proliferation. If there is more than one relevant secreted molecule a similar process would be followed. Once we have data showing that we have interesting molecules, we will submit an invention report to the Office of Intellectual Property at UCLA. This office supports scientists by contacting potentially interested companies and helping disseminate information on technologies available for licensing. In some cases UCLA technologies are commercialized by large companies. Alternatively, some entrepreneurs-inventors form successful startups based on their own UCLA technology.     <P>
2) Generation of cells for cell replacement therapies: The presence of functional myelin is essential for all our normal daily activities. Our overall goal is to investigate the prospects of cell replacement therapies for patients that require normal OL and myelin to restore proper CNS function. We contemplate to be able to apply this approach to propagate OLPs also known as (OPCs) and make them available to treat the spectrum of myelin disorders, from white matter damage in the premature neonate and infants suffering of autism or maternal prenatal infection, to the patient with leukodystrophies, multiple sclerosis, psychosis/schizophrenia, and trauma. We have previously demonstrated that OLPs are cells that, once grafted, migrate, integrate, and interact with the host CNS. Validating the functionality of OLPs exposed to real µG will open a new era on the ways we conceive cell replacement therapies and CNS repair. Moreover, trauma to the brain and spinal cord involves myelin loss and glial and neuronal cell death; thus, data generated by the current study will provide insights on producing cells to be transplanted into the CNS of individuals suffering from trauma.     <P>
Prior to commercializing the generation of cell populations in microgravity, it is essential to confirm that microgravity-exposed cells are fully functional and safe; by biochemical and pre-clinical neural transplantation proposed in this grant application we will generate the necessary evidence. Once this step will have been accomplished, we’ll contact specific companies that might provide us with the revenue necessary to fund the scale-up process to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPS) derived oligodendrocytes progenitors (OLP). By then we hope to have created strong partnership with the industry in order to be able to generate cells to overcome neural degeneration and developmental disabilities. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Recent data from NASA shows that astronauts present vision, physiological and anatomical changes as well as, intracranial pressure (ICP) and, visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) after long-duration space missions. These changes are unlike any clinical entity previously seen. Yet, the cause(s) of chronically elevated ICP/VIIP and potential consequences are unknown. The main goal of this International Space Station spaceflight proposal is to obtain reference data on the effects of real microgravity (0G) to validate and expand our recent data obtained using simulated microgravity (sim-µG). We want to assess the impact of real microgravity on the cell cycle of human neural stem cells and derived oligodendrocytes (OL) that are the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We now have evidence that sim-µG increases the number of neural progenitors and OL progenitor (OLP) via cell proliferation.  Here we postulate that microgravity-associated VIIP and altered ophthalmic anatomy (papilledema, choroidal folds, etc.) as well as a potential microgravity-associated ICP without visual impairment might be at least in part due to increased cell proliferation in the brain.     <P>
Aims: I. To test the hypothesis that neural stem cells (NSC) and OL progenitors exposed to real microgravity will proliferate faster and will give rise to more progenies than cells grown in 1G.     <P>
II. To test the hypothesis that in real microgravity NSC and OL produce and secrete one or more molecules that may act as regulators of cell proliferation.     <P>
Significance. Neural cells possess intrinsic plasticity that can be modulated by the environment and their response to real microgravity may confirm and even reveal new properties of these cells triggered by it. We also propose to examine molecules secreted by these cells while in space in order to identify potentially unique regulators of cell proliferation. It is known that secretome proteins play a key role in cell signaling and cell migration. These molecules may also hold a potential key for the modulation of normal cell proliferation for future therapeutic interventions for the CNS.     <P>
Approach. Human NSC and OLP will be plated using our proprietary specific culture media in self-contained hardware designed for 0G (Astrium). Control cells will be maintained in 1G.     <P>
Ground based experiments. We will analyze the effects of real microgravity on NSC and OL cell cycle via immunocytochemistry. After landing and recovery of the samples, the conditioned culture medium will be collected, maintained at 4°C and transported to our laboratory to further characterize the secretome of both cell types maintained in real microgravity. Our stem cell culture medium as well as the oligodendrocyte specification medium are both serum-free and contain few proteins, properties that will facilitate the secretome analysis. The characterization of the secretome will include identification of proteins and small molecules that may be produced and secreted in real microgravity only.     <P>
Innovation. This is the first study on the impact of real microgravity on human neural cells. Our data will provide valuable information to better understand the gravitational epigenetic modulation of human neural cells.     <P>
Benefits for Humanity. Confirming that real microgravity increases cell proliferation will move us forward toward a better understanding on the causes of ICP and VIIP in astronauts. Moreover, since long-term missions in space are imminent, the identification of molecules that increase cell proliferation might lead to the design of potential countermeasures to prevent or alleviate the negative effects observed in astronauts exposed to long-term missions in space. Myelin is responsible for the rapid conduction of electrochemical messages to and from the brain. Since there is no cure for myelin disorders our data might also lead to novel therapeutic modalities for myelin repair. <P></td>
