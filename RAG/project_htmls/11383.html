                    <td colspan="3"> Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the "spaceflight syndrome") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.    <P>
Central Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.    <P>
Specific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:    <P>
A. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.    <P>
B. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or "RNA-Seq") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance.    <P>
	This report documents the activities related to “Global transcriptome profiling to identify cellular stress mechanisms responsible for spaceflight-induced antibiotic resistance”. The original grant was to perform the spaceflight experiment “Biological Research in Canisters #21 (BRIC-21), with the aim of understanding how bacterial cells perceive and respond to the human spaceflight environment. We have successfully completed all the original aims and goals of this grant proposal.    <P>
New Objective:  	In 2019, this grant was tasked with a new objective: to develop and test in spaceflight a new sample compartment for use in BRIC-PDFU and/or BRIC-LED hardware. In all previous BRIC experiments, the sample compartment consisted of the bottom half of a standard 60-mm Petri dish. However, during the BRIC-21 experiment we noted that liquid cultures assumed a toroidal shape in spaceflight (FL), in contrast to the disk-shaped ground control (GC) samples. It was hypothesized that this difference in culture geometry might account in part for the measured differences in the transcriptomic responses between FL and GC samples (Morrison, M.D., P. Fajardo-Cavazos, and W.L. Nicholson. 2019. Comparison of Bacillus subtilis transcriptome profiles from two separate missions to the International Space Station. npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0).  	In collaboration with the laboratories of Drs. Mark Weislogel and Titel Jurca, we have conceived and built a new sample compartment designed to mitigate the effects of microgravity on liquid culture geometry in petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Drop-tower and biocompatibility testing of a prototype device was in progress when our labs were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which essentially halted all progress on the project for several months. During the past year (10/01/2020 to 09/30/2021), we have resumed laboratory operations and have completed testing of the new modified Petri dish insert. It is now ready for utilization in spaceflight. <P></td>

						The major factor influencing the behavior of microbes growing in liquids in space is microgravity. We recently measured the transcriptomic response of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis to the microgravity environment inside the ISS in spaceflight hardware called Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs). In two separate experiments in the ISS, dubbed BRIC-21 and BRIC-23, we grew multiple replicates of the same B. subtilis strain in the same hardware, growth medium, and temperature with matching ground control samples (npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0). [Ed. Note: See Cumulative Bibliography listing.] In both experiments, we observed similar responses of the transcriptome to spaceflight. However, we also noted that the liquid cultures assumed a different configuration in microgravity (a toroidal shape) compared with the ground control samples (a flat disk shape), leading us to question whether the transcriptome differences we observed were a direct result of microgravity, or a secondary result of the different liquid geometries of the samples affecting, for example, oxygen availability.    <P>
To mitigate the influence of microgravity on liquid geometry in BRIC canisters, we have designed an insert to replace the standard 60-mm Petri dish in BRIC-PDFU or BRIC-LED sample compartments. In this design, liquid cultures are expected to assume a more disk-like configuration regardless of gravity or its absence. We have: (i) constructed a prototype device by 3D printing; (ii) evaluated different starting materials, treatments, and coatings for their wettability (i.e., hydrophilicity) using contact angle measurements; (iii) confirmed that the device performs as designed by drop-tower testing and; (iv) performed material biocompatibility studies using liquid cultures of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Future microgravity testing of the device in the ISS is planned.  <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the "spaceflight syndrome") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.    <P>
Central Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.    <P>
Specific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:    <P>
A. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.    <P>
B. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or "RNA-Seq") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance. <P></td>

						Introduction:     <P>
	This report documents the activities related to “Global transcriptome profiling to identify cellular stress mechanisms responsible for spaceflight-induced antibiotic resistance.” The original grant was to perform the spaceflight experiment “Biological Research in Canisters #21 (BRIC-21)," with the aim of understanding how bacterial cells perceive and respond to the human spaceflight environment. We have successfully completed all of the original aims and goals of this grant proposal.    <P>
New Objective:  	In 2019, this grant was tasked with a new objective: to develop and test in spaceflight a new sample compartment for use in Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC/PDFU) and/or BRIC-LED (Light Emitting Diode) hardware. In all previous BRIC experiments, the sample compartment has consisted of the bottom half of a standard 60-mm Petri dish. However, during the BRIC-21 experiment it was noted that liquid cultures assumed a toroidal shape in flight (FL), in contrast to the disk-shaped ground control (GC) samples. It was hypothesized that this difference in culture geometry might account in part for the measured differences in the transcriptomic responses between FL and GC samples (Morrison, M.D., P. Fajardo-Cavazos, and W.L. Nicholson. 2019. Comparison of Bacillus subtilis transcriptome profiles from two separate missions to the International Space Station. npj Microgravity 5:1. doi: 10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0).    <P>
	In collaboration with Drs. Mark Weislogel and Titel Jurca, we have conceived and built a new sample compartment designed to mitigate the effects of microgravity on liquid culture geometry in petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Drop-tower and biocompatibility testing of a prototype device was in progress when our labs were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which essentially halted all progress on the project for several months. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the "spaceflight syndrome") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.    <P>
Central Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.    <P>
Specific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:    <P>
A. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.    <P>
B. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or "RNA-Seq") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance. <P></td>

FINAL REPORTING SUMMARY--JULY 2018:     <P>
Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in 60-mm Petri plates in liquid medium in BRIC-PDFU hardware in two experiments to the International Space Station, designated BRIC-21 and BRIC-23. These experiments flew on SpaceX resupply Cargo Resupply (CRS) missions 6 and 9. Growth of samples was initiated onboard, terminated by freezing, and returned to Earth on the same mission. It was noted that frozen samples from space were in a toroidal (doughnut) shape, different from ground controls which were frozen as disks in the bottom of plates. Frozen samples were recovered and total RNA was extracted. RNA was subjected to ribosomal RNA depletion and RNA-sequencing. Data were processed through a standardized bioinformatics pipeline for analysis. Data showed that several sets of genes were up-regulated in space, most notably those encoding biofilm-associated functions. Ground control samples showed evidence of gene expression related to oxygen limitation, possibly related to the different geometries assumed by the liquid cultures in space vs. ground.    <P>
  ANNUAL REPORTING FOR SEPTEMBER 2016-AUGUST 2017, AS OF AUGUST 2017:     <P>
Year 3 activities, BRIC-21 mission to the ISS:    <P>
1. Numbers of Bacillus subtilis viable cells were found not to be significantly different in Flight (FL) vs. Ground Control (GC) samples.    <P>
2. We have completed antibiotic resistance screening of B. subtilis FL and GC samples to a battery of 72 different antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using Omnilog Phenotype Microarray (PM) assays. We found no significant difference in the resistance of FL vs. GC samples to 63 of these compounds. FL samples were more resistant than GC samples to 3 antibiotics, and more sensitive to 6 antibiotics. Of these nine compounds, we further tested FL vs. GC samples for resistance levels by standard broth-dilution assay and found no significant difference in the resistance levels of FL vs. GC samples. These results have been submitted for publication.    <P>
3. We have completed isolation of rifampicin-resistant RifR mutants from the BRIC-21 Flight (FL) and Ground Control (GC) experiments. We found that FL and GC samples mutated to RifR with essentially equal frequencies. We determined the nucleotide sequences of these mutations in the Bacillus subtilis rpoB gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. We found that FL and GC samples exhibited dramatic differences in the spectrum of mutations within rpoB. These results are being prepared for publication and will be submitted before the end of Year 3.    <P>
4. We have completed extraction of total RNA from FL vs. GC samples, have performed RNA-seq, and have received the unprocessed raw data. We are currently analyzing these 12 data sets using standard bioinformatics software. We plan to request a 1-year no-cost extension in order to finish the data analysis and publish the results. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the "spaceflight syndrome") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.    <P>
Central Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.    <P>
Specific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:    <P>
A. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.    <P>
B. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or "RNA-Seq") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance. <P></td>

						Introduction:   	This report documents the second year activities related to the spaceflight experiment informally referred to here as “Biological Research in Canisters #21 (BRIC-21), with the aim of understanding how bacterial cells perceive and respond to the human spaceflight environment, particularly regarding their development of antibiotic resistance.    <P>
Post-experiment sample processing:   	Samples were processed for (i) viable counts; (ii) isolation of rifampicin-resistant (RFMR) mutants; (iii) total RNA isolation; or (iv) Omnilog phenotype microarray profiling.     <P>
	(i) Viable counts. B. subtilis cultures were diluted serially tenfold in PBS buffer, dilutions plated on TSY agar plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours. Viable counts were calculated for Flight (FL) and Ground Control (GC) samples. Because samples were unpaired, non-parametric statistics were applied (Kruskal-Wallis). Conclusion: cells grew to essentially the same concentration in FL and GC samples.    <P>
	(ii) Rifampicin-resistant (RFMR) mutants: The frequency of mutation to RFMR was calculated by dividing the total number of RFMR mutants by the total number of viable cells from each of 3 cultures. Conclusion: FL cultures demonstrated a significantly higher mutation frequency to RFMR than did GC cultures. Individual RFMR mutants have been streak-purified and saved as frozen -70°C glycerol stocks for further characterization by DNA sequencing. We plan to thaw and process additional PDFUs from this experiment to obtain higher numbers of mutants for sequencing analyses.    <P>
	(iii) RNA–seq. B. subtilis cells were thawed on ice, recovered by centrifugation at 0°C, and  immediately processed on ice for total RNA extraction. Three entire cultures from FL and GC were processed. Total RNA was isolated and sent to Hudson Alpha Institute to perform RNA-seq. Hudson Alpha performed QC on the samples and provided the following yield and RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN). Conclusion: Sufficient high-quality RNA was isolated to perform RNA-seq. RNA-seq was performed at Hudson Alpha Institute. Graduate student Michael Morrison has been tasked with analysis of the data. Before meaningful analyses could be performed, Michael developed and used the following pipeline to process the raw data:    <P>
1. Raw data were downloaded from the Hudson Alpha server using the software Cygwin.    <P>
2. Raw data, consisting of 12 raw data files (2 for each sample, corresponding to the Forward and Reverse strands), were uploaded to the UF Galaxy server.    <P>
3. Each file was run through FastQ Groomer, to ensure that the sequences were all in the correct format for further processing.    <P>
4. Each file was run through FastQ Trimmer, which removed random sequences from the first 12 bases of the 5’ end of each sequence.    <P>
5. Files were run through FastQC; Read QC to identify low-quality sequences.    <P>
6. If low-quality sequences were detected, the file was run through Steps 4 and 5 again.     <P>
7. Paired files were run through Bowtie2, which mapped the sequences to the most- recently annotated B. subtilis genome sequence.    <P>
8. The Bowtie2 results were run through the program “sam-stats” for quality control on the alignments.    <P>
9. The Bowtie2 files were then run through the program “htseq”, which counted the number of alignments which mapped to each gene.    <P>
10. All of the ‘htseq’ count files were compiled into a master Excel spreadsheet for further comparison and analysis.    <P>
Conclusion: analysis of processed data is currently in progress.    <P>
	(iv) Omnilog phenotype microarrays: frozen samples were thawed, washed once in Phosphate-Buffered Saline, diluted to the appropriate cell concentration in Inoculating Fluid, and inoculated into PM-11, PM-12, and PM-13 plates containing various concentrations of 72 different antibiotics. Plates were incubated at 37°C in the Omnilog instrument (Biolog, Inc.) and plate images recorded at 15-min intervals for 24 hours. Antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between FL and GC samples for significant differences.     <P>
	FL and GC samples showed no difference in susceptibility to nearly all of the antibiotics tested, with the exceptions of enoxacin and nalidixic acid (NOTE: 6-mercaptopurine is an immunosuppressant anti-cancer drug, not an antibiotic). It is interesting to note that both enoxacin and nalidixic acid belong to the class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which act by inhibiting DNA gyrase. Closer inspection of the resistance patterns to these two antibiotics in FL vs. GC samples confirmed that FL samples were more resistant than GC samples. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the "spaceflight syndrome") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.    <P>
Central Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.    <P>
Specific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:    <P>
A. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel BRIC canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.    <P>
B. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or "RNA-Seq") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance. <P></td>

Strains used:  	Bacillus subtilis WN1532 (trpC2) from the PI’s strain collection and Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA USA. Medium used throughout was Trypticase Soy Yeast Extract (TSY) medium containing (g/L): Tryptone, 15; Soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; Yeast Extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; final pH 7. For semisolid plates, agar was added to TSY at 15.0 g/L. As appropriate, the antibiotic rifampicin (RFM) (Sigma-Aldrich) was each added to TSY at a final concentration of 5 µg/mL.     <P>
Sample preparation:  	B. subtilis spores were prepared by cultivation in Schaeffer Sporulation Medium and purified as described previously (Nicholson and Setlow 1990). Spores were determined by phase-contrast microscopy to be >99% free of cell debris and unsporulated cells, and were stored at 4°C in deionized water. The working suspension of spores contained 10^8 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. S. epidermidis cells were prepared by overnight growth in TSY liquid medium and a calibration curve was constructed relating Optical Density at 660 nm (OD660) to viable cell titer. Overnight cultures were diluted to in TSY to a working concentration of 10^8 colony forming units (CFU) per mL prior to use. Aliquots of 0.1 mL (~10^7 CFU) of each suspension were applied to the bottoms of sterile 60-mm diameter Petri dishes (Falcon Cat. No. 1007) and air-dried for 48-72 h at room temperature prior to use.    <P>
BRIC spaceflight hardware:  	The experiments described here utilized Dual-Chamber Biological Research in Canisters (DC-BRIC) spaceflight hardware, which has been described in detail previously (Paul and others 2012).  BRIC canisters hold six 60-mm diameter Petri plates in small sub-compartments called Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs). Each PDFU allows external actuation of the experiment via medium addition without manipulating the samples. For flight (FL) experiments we were allocated four BRIC canisters and 20 total PDFUs. The PDFUs occupied 5 slots in each BRIC canister, and the sixth position in each canister was occupied by a HOBO temperature data logger. Post-flight asynchronous ground control (GC) experiments were conducted using the same hardware and configuration as in the flight experiment. Each PDFU was loaded with a Petri dish containing air-dried cells or spores and each Dual Chamber piston was loaded with 17 mL of sterile TSY medium. To prevent contamination, all reagents and equipment used were sterilized prior to use and PDFUs were assembled within a sterilized laminar flow hood. To maintain airspace in the PDFUs, each chamber was inoculated with only 8.5 mL of TSY medium upon actuation.     <P>
Spaceflight (FL) timeline:  	The BRIC-21 hardware payload was launched on the sixth SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the ISS (SpaceX-6) on 14 April 2015, using the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule configuration. The Dragon capsule docked with the ISS on 17 April 2015, the four BRIC canisters were transferred to the ISS, and stowed in the US laboratory module. Actuation of all 4 canisters (i.e., injection of growth medium) was performed on 20 April 2015 by European Space Agency (ESA) Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti at 0800 EDT and samples were incubated at ISS ambient temperature until 21 April 2015 at 0900 EDT, resulting in a total incubation time of 25 h. The experiment was terminated by transfer into the onboard -80°C MELFI freezer. The Dragon capsule returned to Earth on 21 May 2015 and samples were maintained in the frozen state until return to Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Samples were de-integrated at KSC on 1-2 June 2015. BRIC canisters were moved from storage at -80°C to the benchtop at KSC and allowed to warm sufficiently for deintegration such that samples in Petri dishes were still frozen. Frozen Petri dishes were removed from PDFUs, transported to the SLS lab on dry ice, and stored at -70°C until used for further processing.     <P>
Ground control (GC) timeline:  	Asynchronous GC experiments were performed in BRIC canisters. Samples were incubated in the KSC ISS Environmental Chamber following the temperature regime recorded during flight and transferred to a -80°C freezer and stored until further processing. Time and temperature profiles closely mimicked those determined during the FL experiment. GC experiments were initiated on 16 Jun 2015 and deintegrated on 6-7 Aug 2015.    <P>
Post-experiment sample processing:  	Frozen cell samples were transferred to the benchtop and partially thawed. The partially frozen cell slurry was transferred using a sterile disposable rubber spatulas into sterile 50-mL conical centrifuge tubes and placed immediately on ice. The culture volume recovered was recorded for later calculations. Samples were further processed for (i) viable counts; (ii) isolation of rifampicin-resistant (RFM^R) mutants; (iii) total RNA isolation; or (iv) Omnilog phenotype microarray profiling.     <P>
	(i) For viable counts, cultures were diluted serially tenfold in TSY medium, dilutions plated on TSY, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours.    <P>
	(ii) To select for RFM^R mutants, cultures were concentrated by centrifugation, plated without dilution onto TSY+RFM (5 µg/mL) plates, and colonies counted after incubation at 37°C for 24 hours. The frequency of mutation to RFM^R was calculated by dividing the total number of RFM^R mutants by the total number of viable cells from each culture. Individual RFM^R mutants were streak-purified and saved as frozen -70°C glycerol stocks for further characterization by DNA sequencing.    <P>
	(iii) For total RNA isolation, cells were recovered by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C) in a benchtop centrifuge. Supernatants were discarded and cell pellets immediately processed on ice for total RNA extraction.  	(iv) For Omnilog phenotype microarray experiments, frozen samples were thawed, washed once in Phosphate-Buffered Saline, diluted to the appropriate cell concentration in Inoculating Fluid, and inoculated into PM-11, PM-12, and PM-13 plates containing various concentrations of 72 different antibiotics. Plates were incubated at 37°C in the Omnilog instrument (Biolog, Inc.) and plate images recorded at 15-min intervals for 24 hours. Antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between FL and GC samples for significant differences.   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Responses of various microorganisms to the spaceflight environment have been examined by numerous studies conducted either in space or on the ground in clinostats. The results clearly show that several microbial behaviors differ in space, but not in a consistent way. The underlying mechanism(s) involved are not explainable by a single model. Exposure to the spaceflight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation) alters a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, lowering convective mass and heat transfer or reducing mechanical shear forces. Changes in such fundamental physical forces affect the rates at which gases, nutrients, signaling molecules, and waste products are exchanged between microbes and their surroundings. Microbes perceive these alterations as environmental stress (i.e., the "spaceflight syndrome") and mount a complex set of stress responses. One consequence of the spaceflight stress response is alteration in their susceptibility to antibiotics. This could be due to mechanisms such as: production of biofilms, alteration of cell surfaces, up-regulation of drug efflux systems, or an increased rate of mutation in genes encoding drug targets. All of these mechanisms have been well documented as outputs of global microbial stress responses. Of particular interest is oxidative stress, which has been shown both to trigger maladaptive responses in higher organisms including astronauts, and to increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics.    <P>
Central Hypothesis: Microorganisms subjected to the integrated spaceflight environment invoke a spectrum of stress responses, some leading to alterations in their antibiotic susceptibility. The underlying mechanisms can be identified using transcriptome profiling of model organisms.    <P>
Specific Aims: We postulate that spaceflight stress responses vary depending on the organism studied because each species of microbe is endowed with its own unique collection of stress response systems. In order to probe the underlying mechanism(s) involved it will be necessary to study spaceflight stress response at the genomic level using model organisms. Specifically we plan to:    <P>
A. Expose the model bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis to: (i) simulated microgravity in the laboratory and (ii) actual spaceflight in 2 parallel BRIC canisters (BRIC-A and BRIC-B) aboard the ISS, with appropriate ground controls. Cells cultivated in BRIC-A will be fixed rapidly with RNA Later and cells in BRIC-B will be frozen in a viable state for return to Earth.    <P>
B. Total RNA will be extracted from cells in BRIC-A and subjected to transcriptome analysis using Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (a.k.a. RNA sequencing or "RNA-Seq") at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (UF-ICBR), to identify the suite of stress responses induced by exposure to spaceflight or simulated microgravity. Cells in BRIC-B will be thawed and immediately assayed for (i) viability, (ii) resistance levels to a battery of antibiotics in the Omnilog system, and (iii) rates of spontaneous mutation to antibiotic resistance.  <P></td>
