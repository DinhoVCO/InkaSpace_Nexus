                    <td colspan="3"> A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increase susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.     <P>
  In short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in "Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration" including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA (NASA Research Announcement). <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.     <P>
Understanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. For example, loss of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma is a commonality abound spaceflight/disuse, aging, Type 2 diabetes, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oxidative stress appears to be at the root of nNOSµ loss in theses muscle myopathies.  Out laboratory seeks to understand the underlying redox mechanisms that leader to perturbation in nNOS function and thus myopathy. <P></td>

						Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that adapts rapidly to changes in mechanical loading by altering its cross-sectional area and mass. The reduced mechanical loading of spaceflight causes postural muscles in the lower extremities and flexors in the upper extremities to lose fiber cross-sectional area and force-generating capacity. Muscle atrophy and weakness may then impede mission objectives, increase the risk of injury, and increase susceptibility to damage upon reloading. Muscular alterations with spaceflight are therefore a critical limitation to performance during spaceflight missions and a serious health concern for astronauts.     <P>
Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is considered an important component of muscle myopathy with unloading. ROS are produced from the mitochondria and non-phagocytic NADPH-oxidases (NOX) in skeletal muscle fibers and thought to contribute to atrophy through activation of proteolytic pathways. In addition, ROS may initiate a signaling pathway that results in disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-complex (DGC). The DGC serves as an interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix and is responsible for the detection and transmittance of load necessary for regulation of various cellular processes. Recent evidence from our laboratory and others indicates that ROS-induced atrophy is related to disruption of the DGC and translocation of the mu(µ)-splice variant of nNOS from the sarcolemma into the cytosol. nNOSµ is then thought to directly stimulate FoxO3a and ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1, atrogin-1), leading to muscle fiber atrophy.    <P>
The purpose of this investigation is to identify oxidant-related mechanisms that lead to disruption of the DGC, translocation nNOSµ, proteolysis, and thus atrophy. Our central hypothesis is that ROS, produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria, cause translocation of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis and suppressing protein synthesis. Our experimental design consists of a series of studies utilizing a rodent hindlimb unloading model of spaceflight to: (1) identify NOX dependent signaling of nNOS translocation, FoxO3a activation, and muscle fiber atrophy, and (2) determine the redox regulatory role in DGC disruption with mechanical unloading and atrophy. In addition, additional investigation has been commenced to better translate these findings to spaceflight, where we have begun to use pharmaceutical (Losartan) and nutraceutical (fish oil + curcumin) interventions to limit unloading-induced atrophy.     <P>
Data that has been collected thus far indicates that: (1) administration of a potent antioxidant, the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134, prevents unloading induced atrophy during a short-term (54  hr) unloading protocol. Reduced atrophy was related to decreased expression of NOX subunits, ROS production, and markers of ROS-related signaling/damage. In addition, nNOS translocation was prevented with EUK-134 administration as well as related activation of proteolysis through FoxO3a dephosphorylation; (2) EUK-134 also prevented unloading induced atrophy during a longer 7-day unloading protocol, an effect also related to decreased ROS production and nNOS translocation as well as activation of anabolic pathways; (3) More specific targeting of ROS production by using a NOX-2 inhibitor, gp91 ds-tat, and mitochondrial ROS inhibitor, SS-31, has also resulted in reduced muscle fiber atrophy following a 7-day unloading protocol. Interestingly, an interaction between these two sources of ROS has also been suggested with our pilot data; and lastly, (4) pharmaceutical inhibition of angiotensin II receptor I (AT1R), and (5) a nutraceutical interventions with fish oil + curcumin, respectively, have demonstrated similar results.     <P>
In summary, inhibition of ROS appears to be effective in limiting skeletal muscle atrophy with mechanical unloading. Inhibition of ROS is related to augmented anabolic and reduced catabolic signaling as well as translocation of nNOS, and the source of ROS production may be from both the mitochondria and Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase. Future studies will focus on finalizing the 7-day EUK-134 interventional study including measurement of fractional synthesis rate; further delineating the mechanisms responsible for reduced atrophy with peptidyl inhibition of ROS using gp91ds-tat to target Nox2 and SS-31 to target mitochondria. We will also utilize a genetic ablation of Nox2 (gp91phox-/-) to further establish its role in unloading induced atrophy; and establishing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical interventions in preventing unloading-induced atrophy. In addition, fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and rate of protein degradation will be assessed in future experiments. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increase susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will Identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.     <P>
  In short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in "Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration" including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA (NASA Research Announcement). <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.     <P>
Understanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. For example, loss of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma is a commonality abound spaceflight/disuse, aging, Type 2 diabetes, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oxidative stress appears to be at the root of nNOSµ loss in theses muscle myopathies.  Out laboratory seeks to understand the underlying redox mechanisms that leader to perturbation in nNOS function and thus myopathy. <P></td>

						A.  The Role of Oxidative Stress in Akt-mTOR Anabolic Signaling in Unloaded Skeletal Muscle    <P>
Skeletal muscles are dynamic mechanical and metabolic machines that adapt quickly to changes in their mechanical environment by altering rates in protein synthesis and protein degradation, and thus mass. Removal of mechanical loading during the microgravity (µG) of spaceflight or bedrest causes rapid atrophy of affected skeletal muscles. Recently, we identified that translocation of the mu-splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSµ) and downstream activation of FoxO3a were redox-sensitive phenomena (Lawler et al., AJP  2014 Apr 1;306(7):R470-82). Here, we tested the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributed to perturbations in Akt-mTOR signaling using the rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) model of microgravity. The superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic EUK-134 (10 mg/kg/day) was used as an antioxidant intervention in a 7-day protocol (n=6/group) using Fischer-344 (F344) rats: control ambulatory (CON), 7 days of hindlimb unloading (HU), and HU + EUK-134 (HUEUK). We found that EUK-134 reduced oxidative stress, dephosphorylation of FoxO3a, and mitigated muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shift from slow to fast-twitch in the rat soleus muscle. Furthermore, Akt phosphorylation (Ser473)/total Akt ratio and phosphorylated mTOR (Ser2448)/total mTOR ratio were greater in the HUEUK group than in HU solei. However, EUK-134 did not rescue p70S6K phosphorylation (Thr389) during HU. Membrane GLUT-4+ staining increased with HU but was abrogated by EUK-134, consistent with a fiber-type shift during HU, and inconsistent with increased insulin resistance by mechanical unloading. Therefore, we conclude that oxidative stress alters both anabolic (Akt-mTOR) and catabolic (FoxO3a) signaling in the unloaded soleus muscle, during a ground µG model.    <P>
  B. Effect of EUK-134 on nNOS translocation and membrane repair proteins regulation in the rat soleus during 7 days of mechanical unloading    <P>
Skeletal muscles exhibit high adaptability in response to mechanical stimuli. Decreases in mechanical loading, such as bedrest or spaceflight, alter the balance between protein synthesis and degradation, resulting in muscle atrophy. Recent studies revealed that oxidative stress contributes to unloading-induced muscle atrophy via translocation of the mu-splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSµ), calpains, and activation of FoxO3a. While the transport system responsible for nNOSµ translocation is unclear, nNOSµ appears to detach during unloading from a-syntrophin and dystrophin, but remains tethered to dysferlin. However, the role of membrane repair proteins in unloading-induced nNOS translocation is unknown. We hypothesized that ROS would affect membrane repair proteins associated with nNOSµ translocation in unloaded skeletal muscle. The superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic EUK-134 (10 mg/kg/day) was used as an antioxidant intervention in a 7-day protocol (n=6/group) using Fischer-344 (F344) rats: control ambulatory (CON), 7 days of hindlimb unloading (HU), and HU + EUK-134 (HUEUK). We used cytosolic and crude membrane protein expression of nNOS to observe translocation of nNOS. We also determined abundance and location of dysferlin and caveolin-3, a caveolar protein that can inhibit nNOS. We found that EUK-134 provided significant protection against loss of nNOS from the crude membrane fraction, with levels greater than the HU group but similar with controls. Conversely, HU caused a significant increase in cytosolic nNOS abundance, while cytosolic nNOS abundance in the HUEUK group was not significantly greater than CON. Caveolin-3 and dysferlin protein levels were higher in the unloaded soleus in both the membrane and cytosolic fractions, while caveolin-3 upregulation was mitigated by EUK-134 intervention. Our results suggest that oxidative stress plays a role in nNOS translocation, possibly guided by dysferlin and caveolin-3.    <P>
  C. Nox2 Inhibition Prevents Skeletal Muscle Atrophy and nNOS Translocation in Hindlimb Unloaded Rats.    <P>
During mechanical unloading (e.g., spaceflight, bedrest), skeletal muscle undergoes an atrophic process, rapidly losing mass and cross-sectional area, with a concomitant decrease in force generating capacity and shift from type I (slow twitch) to type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers. Our research focuses on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during muscle atrophy, and how inhibition of ROS production may help ameliorate the effects of unloading and atrophy on skeletal muscle. We have identified translocation of the mu splice variant of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSµ) into the cell as a signaling event in atrophy.  In addition, upregulation of the membrane bound protein NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) could be a key source of cellular ROS production during mechanical unloading. We hypothesized that use of the selective NOX2 inhibitor gp91ds-tat would prevent the deleterious effects of unloading on skeletal muscle.    <P>
We utilized the rodent hindlimb unloading model as a ground analog for microgravity. Fifteen Fischer-344 rats were divided into three groups (n=5): ambulatory controls (CON), hindlimb unloaded animals (HU), and hindlimb unloaded animals treated with gp91ds-tat (HU-G).    <P>
Treatment with gp91ds-tat had effects on markers of muscle morphology and nNOSµ translocation. Using one-way ANOVA with SNK post hoc test, we determined that gp91ds-tat offered significant protection against atrophy when comparing intervention animals to their unloaded counterparts (p < 0.05), and approached significance. Further, gp91ds-tat prevented nNOSµ translocation, as demonstrated using confocal micrographs, while also ameliorating the nNOS activity inside the muscle cell, as measured using NADPH diaphorase staining (p < 0.05). Based on these results, we conclude that NOX2 plays a role in nNOSµ translocation away from the sarcolemma and muscle atrophy, and that inhibition of this enzyme could be an avenue by which to prevent the harmful effects of unloading on skeletal muscle.     <P>
  D. Effect of Fish Oil and Curcumin Supplementation on Muscle Cross Sectional Area, Anabolic Signaling.     <P>
Skeletal muscle is a highly adaptable tissue capable of remodeling when dynamic stress is altered such as mechanical loading/unloading and stretch. When muscle is subjected to an unloaded state associated with bedrest, immobilization, or microgravity the muscle cross sectional area (CSA), and fiber-type shift from slow to fast, and impairs force production. In addition, muscle fiber-type shifts from slow to fast-twitch fibers. Unloading also results in a downregulation of anabolic signaling and heat shock proteins which further exacerbate these morphological changes. Our lab recently showed reactive oxygen species (ROS) are causal in translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSµ) away from the cell membrane, muscle fiber atrophy, and fiber-type shift. Nutritional supplements fish oil and curcumin improves anabolic signaling, glutathione, and heat shock proteins, respectively. We hypothesized that fish oil, rich in omega-3-fatty acids, combined with polyphenol curcumin protect anabolic (Akt pathway) signaling and heat shock proteins in the rat soleus muscle, concomitant with protection of morphology, as a synergistic countermeasure. For this study C57BL/6 mice were divided into 3 groups (n=6/group): ambulatory controls w/3% corn oil in diet (CON), hindlimb unloading w/3% corn oil in diet (HU), and hindlimb unloading w/3% fish oil and 1% curcumin in diet. Fish Oil and Curcumin (FOC) treatments began 7 days prior to HU and mice were anesthetized following 10 days of HU. FOC mitigated the unloading-induced decrease in CSA and prevented the fiber-type shift normally. FOC also rescued anabolic signaling (Akt phosphorylation, p70S6K phosphorylation) and increased the abundance of HSP70. Therefore, we concluded that FOC prevents muscle atrophy in concert with the ability to boost heat shock proteins and anabolic signaling in an unloaded state.    <P>
  E. AT1 receptor blockade attenuates hindlimb unloading-induced modifications of Nox2, nNOS, and FoxO3a signaling in skeletal muscle.    <P>
Extended duration of reduced mechanical loading results in weakening and atrophy of skeletal muscles. Disuse-induced atrophy is due in part to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). For instance, ROS are causal in key disuse atrophy signaling events such as sarcolemma dislocation of nNOS and activation of FoxO3a. Upregulation of the Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase has been implicated in the disuse-associated increase in ROS production. Evidence indicates that activation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is an upstream event leading to Nox2 complex formation and activity. Here, we used an AT1R blocker (losartan) to test the hypothesis that AT1R activation is an upstream signaling event driving Nox2 complex activity, nNOS dislocation, FoxO3a activation, and thus the slow-to-fast fiber type shift and atrophy in the unloaded soleus. Rats were divided into 4 groups: ambulatory control (CON), ambulatory + Losartan (40 mg/kg/day) (CONL), 7-days hindlimb unloaded (HU), and HU + Losartan (HUL). We report that administration of losartan attenuated unloading-induced phenotypic alterations in the soleus muscle, including the shift in fiber-type and reductions in muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA). Losartan administration ameliorated increased ROS levels and the upregulation and activity of Nox2 following unloading. Furthermore, AT1R blockade during unloading mitigated nNOS dislocation away from the sarcolemma. In addition, losartan treatment during disuse offered significant protection against the increase in nuclear localized FoxO3a. We conclude that AT1R blockade attenuates disuse atrophy by inhibiting Nox2 signaling, thereby lessening the extent of nNOS dislocation related signaling. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increase susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will Identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.     <P>
  In short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in "Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration" including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA (NASA Research Announcement). <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.     <P>
Understanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. For example, loss of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma is a commonality abound spaceflight/disuse, aging, Type 2 diabetes, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oxidative stress appears to be at the root of nNOSµ loss in theses muscle myopathies.  Out laboratory seeks to understand the underlying redox mechanisms that leader to perturbation in nNOS function and thus myopathy. <P></td>

Statement of Progress and Summary Data    <P>
In the original research proposal, two specific aims were listed with specific aim 1 to be completed on years 1 & 2 and specific aim 2 to be completed on years 2 & 3:    <P>
Specific   Aim 1:   Identify   NADPH   oxidase-dependent   signaling   on   nNOS translocation,  FoxO3a  activation,  and  muscle  fiber  atrophy  with  hindlimb  unloading. We hypothesize that NOX inhibition using (a) a peptidyl inhibitor (gp91ds-tat), (b) dissociation of NOX subunits (apocynin), and (c) genetic ablation (gp91phox-/-) will attenuate the disuse phenotype: loss of nNOS from the sarcolemma, activation of NF-?B and FoxO3a, proteolysis, reduced  protein  synthesis,  and  fiber  atrophy.  We  further  postulate  that  inhibition  of  c-abl (imatinib)  and  the  angiotensin  II  pathway  via  angiotensin  receptor  1  blockade  (losartan)  will abrogate atrophy and loss of nNOS.    <P>
Specific   Aim   2:   Determine   redox   regulatory   role   in   DGC   disruption   with mechanical  unloading  and  atrophy.  We  hypothesize  that  unloading-induced  elevation translocation of nNOS as well as muscle fiber atrophy are dependent on oxidative stress near the  sarcolemma.  An  SOD/catalase  mimetic  (EUK-134)  and  novel  mitochondrial-specific antioxidant  peptide  (SS-31)  will  mitigate  caveolin-3  upregulation,  nNOS  translocation,  and proteolysis.  Conversely,  genetic  ablation  of  GPX3  (cytosolic  glutathione  peroxidase)  will enhance unloading-induced atrophy and preserve the slow contractile phenotype. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increase susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will Identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.     <P>
  In short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in "Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration" including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA (NASA Research Announcement). <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.     <P>
Understanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. For example, loss of nNOSµ from the sarcolemma is a commonality abound spaceflight/disuse, aging, Type 2 diabetes, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Oxidative stress appears to be at the root of nNOSµ loss in theses muscle myopathies.  Out laboratory seeks to understand the underlying redox mechanisms that leader to perturbation in nNOS function and thus myopathy. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC, and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increases susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis, and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will Identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.     <P>
  In short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity), or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.     <P>
Understanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. <P></td>

						We have made significant progress on both Specific Aims 1 & 2 over the pass 2 years. This includes completion of the following experiments:    <P>
(1) "Administration of the superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic, Eukarion-134, prevents short-duration (54hr) unloading induced atrophy." We have recently published a paper in the American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative, and Comparative Physiology entitled, “EUK-134 ameliorates nNOSµ translocation and skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during short-term mechanical unloading.” In this paper, we demonstrate that administration of the cell permeable synthetic superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase mimetic, EUK-134, prevents a reduction in Type I fiber cross sectional area following a 2-day (~54 hour) unloading protocol in the absence of changes in soleus muscle mass. In conjunction with a reduction of Type I fiber atrophy, EUK-134 prevented a shift in fiber type from type I to type II, an effect commonly observed with mechanical unloading. In addition, EUK-134 was associated with reduced expression of NOX-2 subunits, ROS production (dihydroethidium assay), and reduced ROS-related signaling/damage (4-hydroxynonenal). The positive effects of EUK-134 may be also related to a reduction in nNOS translocation from the sarcolemma to the cytosol and inactivation of the proteolytic signaling molecule, Fox-O3a.    <P>
(2) "Administration of EUK-134 prevents 7-day unloading induced atrophy." We continued experimentation with EUK-134 to include a longer duration 7-day unloading protocol and expect to finalize this project soon. The findings from this study indicate that EUK-134 is also effective at ameliorating soleus muscle atrophy following 7-days of hindlimb unloading. Consistent with improved soleus muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area was improved relative to the unloaded animals with EUK-134 administration; although, it did remain reduced relative to controls. Similarly to the animals that underwent the 2-day unloading protocol, animals with 7-day EUK-134 treatment had reduced markers of ROS production (3-nitrotyrosine) and inhibited nNOS translocation. For this subset of 7- day EUK-134 treated animals, we also measured expression of proteins involved in protein synthesis including protein kinase b (Akt) and mTOR. Activated (phosphorylated) Akt relative to total Akt was not different from controls with EUK-134 treatment, whereas activated (phosphorylated) mTOR relative to total mTOR and remained unchanged between all groups.    <P>
(3) "Novel, targeted countermeasures to prevent ROS-induced skeletal muscle atrophy with unloading." In addition to study conducted with EUK-134, we have started and hope to complete studies in the near future involving more specific targeting of ROS production. This includes utilizing a NOX-2 inhibitor, gp91 ds-tat, and mitochondrial ROS inhibitor, SS-31. In doing so, we are trying to demonstrate which is the more effective inhibitor of ROS production with unloading as related to skeletal muscle alterations with unloading, determine the predominate source of ROS production, as well as evaluate if an interaction exists between these two sources of ROS. So far, utilizing the SS-31 mitochondrial ROS inhibitor has shown that it limits soleus muscle mass wasting and improves cross sectional area. Interestingly, SS-31 also decreases expression of the NOX-2 subunit, p67phox, suggesting a potential interaction between the two. As far as NOX-inhibition with gp91 ds-tat, we have also observed a decrease in muscle wasting as well as an improvement in muscle fiber cross sectional area. This is in conjunction with a reduction in ROS production (dihydroethidium assay). Future study will focus on combined therapy of gp91 ds-tat and SS-31 as well as delineating pathways responsible for limited atrophy with both treatments independently and combined. The effect of gp91 ds-tat and SS-31 on nNOS translocation will also be determined.    <P>
(4) "Translating findings to spaceflight using nutraceutical and pharmaceutical interventions." Nutraceutical and pharmaceutical interventional studies have been commenced to mimic the effects of the ROS peptide inhibitors while developing more translatable findings. More specifically, we have begun to utilize the angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan, commonly used clinically, which should prevent upstream activation of NOX- 2 by inhibiting angiotensin II signaling. Our preliminary findings suggest that soleus muscle mass is not affected by losartan treatment during unloading; however, fiber cross sectional area was no longer different from control with unloading. In addition, losartan prevented fiber atrophy in type I fibers and a shift in fiber type with unloading. Losartan treatment is also apparently effective in decreasing NOX-2 expression and preventing translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. A nutraceutical intervention with a combined treatment of fish oil and curcumin is also apparently effective in preventing soleus muscle atrophy and improving cross sectional area. Future investigation will further clarify the effectiveness of losartan in treating unloading-induced atrophy as well as the fish oil + circumin intervention.    <P>
(5) "Overall summary of future studies." Future study will focus on finalizing the 7-day EUK-134 interventional study including measurement of fractional synthesis rate; further delineating the mechanisms responsible for reduced atrophy with both gp91ds-tat and SS-31 interventions; utilizing a genetic ablation of NOX-2 (gp91phox-/-) and/or dysferlin to further establish their role in unloading induced atrophy; potentially determining the role of microtubule disruption in unloading induced atrophy and nNOS translocation; and establishing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical interventions in preventing unloading-induced atrophy. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increases susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will Identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.     <P>
  In short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bedrest, casting, and spaceflight cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness as a result of disuse. Prolonged spaceflight presents great challenges to the physical performance and health of astronauts as a result of microgravity, or reduced gravitational forces (i.e., loads). Mechanical unloading and extreme disuse during spaceflight produce rapid and dramatic skeletal muscle and weakness. Prolonged disuse also predisposes skeletal muscle to damage when landing on Mars, in an EVA (extra-vehicular activity) or returning to Earth. Furthermore, chronic disuse also contributes to and exacerbates underlying chronic pathology, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. As a result crew health, safety, and completion of mission objectives are placed in jeopardy.      While the pathways that cause atrophy and weakness due to disuse remain uncertain, proteins that sense changes in forces that skeletal muscles must produce may be the key. One of these proteins is nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is positioned near the muscle cell membrane. During spaceflight as well as aging and some types of muscular dystrophy, nNOS appears to be transported away from the cell membrane where it transforms from a muscle building to a muscle wasting agent. We will focus on oxidative stress, produced by excess free radicals produced by proteins near the cell membrane (ex. NOX) and mitochondria and how they affect nNOS transport as well as skeletal muscle atrophy.     <P>
Understanding how these key membrane proteins are regulated will not only aid us in our treatment of disuse-related atrophy, but also will allow development of new therapeutics combating sedentary lifestyle and possible application to aging, Type 2 diabetes, and muscular dystrophies. Indeed, changes that are altered during spaceflight and ground models of spaceflight also appear to change with aging and diseases that cause skeletal muscle wasting and weakness. <P></td>

						We moved in September and October 2012 to newly renovated facilities in Heldenfels Hall.  While this resulted in 2 months downtime, we have now outstanding facilities, including a BSL-2 room with a Biosafety cabinet and 2 core lab fume hoods. NASA projects will be primarily performed in the new facilities as well as core animal and technology facilities on the Texas A&M campus. We have made significant progress on the NASA Space Biology grant, and that report is below:    <P>
Recent evidence and our new data suggest that oxidative stress produced via mitochondrial and membrane protein (ex. NADPH oxidase or NOX) are sources of oxidative stress that may participate in muscle atrophy and weakness that occurs with spaceflight. We are using a targeted approach to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to the transport of nNOS away from the cell membrane.  We are using highly specific agents that include (a) novel mimetics of the enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase (EUK-134) and (b) a mitochondrial-specific antioxidant SS-31. EUK-134 is non-toxic, removes free radicals producing water and oxygen, and does not affect natural antioxidants in the body.    <P>
Initial experiments used EUK-134 to study the early responses to spaceflight using a ground model with rats.  EUK-134 reduced muscle atrophy significantly during short-term spaceflight simulation.  EUK-134 also slowed a conversion of slow-twitch to fast-twitch muscle fibers that occurs with spaceflight.  Levels of NOX and oxidative stress were reduced by EUK-134 during simulated spaceflight as well.  When EUK-134 reduced oxidative stress, it also preserved the location of nNOS near the cell membrane.    <P>
When nNOS is transported away from the cell membrane, it appears to cause atrophy by turning on proteins that trigger digestion of muscle proteins involved in contractions.  One of those proteins activated by movement of nNOS is called FOXO.  Our initial experiments found that EUK-134 reduces FOXO activation and therefore slows the muscle atrophy that occurs. Therefore, a targeted antioxidant drug like EUK-134 could slow down muscle atrophy that occurs during spaceflight.        <P>
While we don’t understand yet how nNOS is transported away from the muscle cell membrane during spaceflight, one protein that may contribute to a loss of nNOS in Duchenne muscular dystrophy is called caveolin-3.  We found that EUK-134 reduced the increase in caveolin-3 that occurred during spaceflight simulation.  This means that changes in caveolin-3 and nNOS are controlled by oxidative stress during spaceflight.    <P>
The emotional stress and loss of gravitational forces could impair glucose tolerance and uptake of glucose during spaceflight.  This may increase oxidative stress and contribute to the muscle atrophy we see in astronauts during spaceflight.  In order for glucose to be taken in by a muscle cell and transport protein GLUT-4 is attached to glucose to allow entry into the cell.  We conducted a study lasting for 7 days of simulated spaceflight.  A week of spaceflight reduced skeletal muscle mass and muscle fiber thickness.  Intervention with EUK-134 during spaceflight attenuated muscle atrophy. However, we found that GLUT-4 levels at the muscle membrane were higher, rather than lower during our ground simulation. The metabolic regulator AMPK was also higher rather than lower, normalized by EUK-134.  These new findings indicate that skeletal muscles are able to compensate their metabolism with spaceflight and are even more capable of taking up glucose for fuel. The data are also inconsistent with the notion that stress hormones such as cortisol (which oppose insulin) released during reduced gravity are enough to cause insulin resistance and impairment of glucose uptake (diabetes-like).    <P>
We used 2 methods of fluorescence and histological staining to show that oxidative stress contributes to loss of nNOS from the muscle cell membrane after one-week of simulated spaceflight.  Both methods clearly showed that nNOS had been transported away from the muscle cell membrane, and this effect was blunted by administration of EUK-134. We also found that NOX was localized in “hot spots” near the cell membrane, and effect also attenuated by EUK-134 therapy.  We believe that NOX is acting as an amplifier of oxidative stress, perhaps working with mitochondria located near the cell membrane.    <P>
    <P>
  Muscle damage can be caused by stressful situations including excessive exercise, prolonged disuse, and disease.  Heat shock proteins such as HSP70 can reduce muscle atrophy. Combinations of anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants, and nutrients have been shown to prevent or reduce damage and muscle wasting. We were interested in testing the effects of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a lycopene precursor, in protecting against skeletal muscle damage caused by disuse. Further, we want to understand the extent in which GGA induces the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in muscles from middle-age Fischer-344 rats. Heat shock proteins are especially important in muscle mass and integrity because they have been proven to exhibit cytoprotective function including inhibition of apoptosis, and the transcription factor FOXO. To address our first question, we used young and middle aged Fischer rats in a hindlimb unloading experiment, as it is a common model for disuse. We unloaded rats for two days and injected them with GGA daily beginning 24 hours prior to unloading. After the experiment, we dissected the soleus and conducted an assessment of internal/central nuclei assessment and muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Our results from the first part of our study indicate that GGA does play a significant role in protecting and restoring skeletal muscle health. Specifically, our data showed a significant difference in the number of internal and central nuclei between treatment groups, which serve as a marker for damage and repair. Our future research will continue with this study to test GGA’s ability to protect muscle cell protection and regeneration, and its relationship with HSP70 induction.     <P>
Sometimes nitric oxide produced by nNOS or another type of NOS could react with free radicals produced by NOX to form peroxynitrite, which is highly dangerous. We used a stain for 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) as a marker. We found that 3NT was indeed greater with 7 days of simulated spaceflight, particularly near the membrane. Recently, it has been shown that the pro-inflammatory iNOS may participate in unloading-induced atrophy, although how this occurs is unsure.     <P>
As astronauts are usually middle-age (40-55) and are growing older on average, we sought to determine whether oxidative stress was responsible for the reduction in nNOS.  We have shown previously that aging cause a reduction in nNOS including nNOS localized at the sarcolemma.  Lifelong exercise or caloric restriction reduced the amount nNOS loss as well as muscle fiber atrophy.       <P>
  We have recently found that (1) oxidative stress contributes to loss of nNOS from the sarcolemma with disuse and DMD, and (2) reduction of nNOS in aging skeletal muscle is reduced by exercise training while oxidative stress is decreased. We postulated that oxidative stress may be causal in the loss of nNOS from the sarcolemmal in aging skeletal muscle. To test this we used EUK-134. Old Fischer-344 rats were administered EUK-134 for 28 days. Young and middle-age F344 rats were used as additional controls. We dissected and froze the plantaris in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. nNOS was localized using immunohistochemistry with a tyramide signaling amplification. We found that nNOS-positive staining decreased in the plantaris from old rats compared with young and mature rats. EUK-134 provided partial protection from the loss of sarcolemmal nNOS.  Transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) was elevated with age, but attenuated with EUK-134. Another protein that can cause muscle wasting (MMP-9) saw an elevation with age that was suppressed by EUK-134.   To our knowledge this study is the first evidence that age-related loss of nNOS from muscle sarcolemma is dependent on oxidative stress. Future research will focus on (a) the mechanisms of nNOS protection and (b) protection against damage with aging. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> A critical limitation to astronaut performance during spaceflight missions including those to the International Space Station and Mars is the impaired contractile ability of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle is a highly specialized tissue that rapidly adapts to dynamic changes in mechanical loading by modifying its ultrastructure and mass. Detection and transmittance of loading are vital to muscle integrity and protein turnover, with a nexus associated with the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton that includes the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and caveolae. This interface between myocytes and the extracellular matrix confers mechanical integrity and activates cell signaling pathways that regulate protein turnover, mitochondrial, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and fiber phenotype. Mechanical unloading experienced in the microgravity of spaceflight elicits large decrements in force generating capacity via reduction in muscle fiber cross sectional area or atrophy. While unloading-induced atrophy is a function of reduced protein synthesis coupled with increased protein degradation, activation of the transcription factors FoxO3a and nuclear factor-kappaB have drawn significant attention as mediators. Although the upstream triggers are not fully understood, translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the DGC and sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm is a novel signaling event that stimulates proteolysis, and thus atrophy. New clues can be gleaned from Duchenne and many of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, pathologies involving mutations to DGC and other sarcolemmal proteins. Because MDs and microgravity both increases susceptibility of muscles to damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory signaling, a shared root cause is suspected: disruption of the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. New studies and Preliminary Data indicate the importance of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX), a sarcolemmal source of oxidative stress, and caveolin-3 in stimulating myopathy in muscular dystrophy models. NOX may be activated upstream by angiotensin II and c-abl, a tyrosine kinase. Further, our pilot data show that unloading-induced alterations in caveolin-3 and nNOS are redox dependent and linked to atrophy and shift in muscle fiber-type.  Our central hypothesis is that oxidative stress produced by NOX pathways and mitochondria directly contribute to a sarcolemmal loss of nNOS during mechanical unloading, enhancing proteolysis and suppressing protein synthesis. The rodent hindlimb unloading model and novel fractional synthesis and degradation will be used to test our hypotheses.  Specific Aim 1 will Identify NOX-dependent signaling on nNOS translocation and muscle fiber atrophy with hindlimb unloading. Specific Aim 2 will determine directly the role of mitochondrial and cytosolic oxidative stress in movement of nNOS away from the muscle cell membrane and disruption of DGC with mechanical unloading.     <P>

In short, our primary objective is to identify the trigger by which skeletal muscles switch from being an anabolic to a catabolic machine during spaceflight, causing muscle atrophy and weakness. We propose that oxidative stress produced by a NOX pathway and mitochondria move the master switch protein (nNOS) away from the cell membrane, which slows protein synthesis and accelerates breakdown of protein.  Our study would directly address high-priority gaps in Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration including the role of reactive oxygen species in protein balance and maintaining the slow contractile phenotype. Our grant proposal would also forward our understanding of (1) alterations in the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and membrane domains, (2) sensing and transduction of loading and gravity, (3) protein turnover, and (4) regulatory mechanisms that govern alterations in skeletal muscle, all programmatic emphases and goals of the current Space Biology NRA. <P></td>
