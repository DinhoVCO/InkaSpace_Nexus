                    <td colspan="3"> This research proposal is aimed at better understanding the basic bone biological effects of various osteoporosis treatments as therapies for reducing or preventing bone loss due to space flight. The project will study hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, which is a technique that is well established as an effective and informative ground-based analog for studying the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system. In order to better understand the detailed effects of each, the treatments will be studied separately. The four treatments to be examined include two anabolic (bone building) therapies and two anti-resorptive therapies. One anabolic approach will use voluntary exercise and the other a new osteoporosis drug (anti-sclerostin antibody). Anti-resorptive drugs are the most popular for treating clinical osteoporosis and achieve their benefits by preventing bone resorption, which is part of the normal cycle of bone replenishment. Furthermore, the treatments will be used as pre-treatments and only administered prior to HU exposure. This is not realistic for astronauts, but it will allow more in-depth study of the fundamental nature of each treatment, and it will also align with the anticipated requirements of possible follow-up space flight experiments using the same rat animal model. The experiments to be conducted will characterize beneficial effects of pre-treatment upon bone loss due to HU as well as bone recovery following HU and return to weightbearing. Bone properties will be quantified using CT-based analyses, histological techniques for assessing bone cell function, as well as biomechanical testing to measure strength. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Completion of the studies outlined in this research proposal will provide new insights into the basic nature of the effects of exercise and pharmaceutical agents and how these interact with mechanical unloading and recovery therefrom.  Removal of weightbearing through hindlimb unloading is a severe and acute form of mechanical disuse that has been shown to simulate many of the effects of microgravity exposure due to space flight on the musculoskeletal system. Hindlimb unloading also induces many musculoskeletal system changes that are similar to accelerated aging as well as other disuse scenarios such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular impairment.  Thus, insights gained should also help advance basic understanding of the fundamental biology associated with Earth-bound clinical medicine as well as space flight effects.  Future space flight experiments can be designed to replicate the research to be conducted in this proposed project, and comparing results from the two will provide essential and more detailed understanding of the full efficacy, as well as limitations, of the adult rat HU model as a ground-based analog for human space flight.  Studying these treatments separately is not necessarily realistic for actual mission scenarios, but the results will nevertheless provide evidence-based rational data for contemplating and designing possible co-therapies using either combinations (simultaneously) or possible sequential scheduling protocols. <P></td>

						As explained in previous year progress reports, an adjustment was made during year 1 to reverse the order of the two animal experiments.  In the proposal, the first set of animal studies (Experiment 1) was to address Specific Aim 1, which compares two anabolic pre-treatments, but we decided to change this to address Specific Aim 2 first.  A major consideration driving this change was to allow more time to acquire the Sclerostin-Antibody drug.  Four experimental groups were needed for each of the two sets of animal experiments as further described below.    <P>
Anti-Resorptive Pre-Treatment Animal Work: The two anti-resorptive pre-treatments are both bisphosphonate drugs, specifically risedronate and alendronate.  The overall protocol structure can be defined as follows:    <P>
	Pre-treatment (PT) period = days 0 to 28    <P>
	Hindlimb unloading (HU) period = days 28 to 56    <P>
	Ambulating recovery (AR) period = days 56 to 112    <P>
The four groups are defined as follows:    <P>
Control (CON) = normal cage activity for PT, HU, and AR periods    <P>
HU Control (HUC) = normal cage for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR    <P>
Risedronate (RIS) = RIS for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR    <P>
Alendronate (ALN) = ALN for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR    <P>
The animal experiments were conducted in three cohorts of animals due to constraints and considerations associated with animal housing space, animal cages, and personnel requirements.  Each cohort involved 45-50 animals, with the scheduling timetable as follows:    <P>
			Cohort 1 – 27 May 2014 to 9 Oct 2014    <P>
			Cohort 2 – 15 July 2014 to 25 Nov 2014    <P>
			Cohort 3 – 30 Sept 2014 to 10 Feb 2015    <P>
All animal experiments included in vivo measures that were made on all animals every 28 days.  The main assessment conducted was pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans, which are made at the proximal tibia metaphysis (PTM) and tibia diaphysis (TD) of anesthetized animals.  In addition, blood was drawn at 28-day intervals for possible serum analysis of bone activity biomarkers.    <P>
  Anabolic Pre-Treatment Animal Work: The four groups identified for the anabolic pre-treatment studies are defined below along with a schematic depiction of the animal protocols.  The two anabolic pre-treatments are pharmaceutical administration and mechanical loading through exercise.  The specific pharmaceutical agent used was an anti-sclerostin anti-body compound provided by Lilly (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) through a Material Transfer Agreement.  The mechanical loading anabolic treatment consisted of a voluntary rat jumping protocol intended to simulate resistance exercise.    <P>
The overall protocol structure is again defined as follows:    <P>
	Pre-treatment (PT) period = days 0 to 28    <P>
	Hindlimb unloading (HU) period = days 28 to 56    <P>
	Ambulating recovery (AR) period = days 56 to 112    <P>
The four groups are defined as follows:    <P>
Control (CON) = normal cage activity for PT, HU, and AR periods    <P>
HU Control (HUC) = normal cage for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR    <P>
Sclerostin Anti-body (SCL) = SCL for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR    <P>
Exercise (REX) = REX for PT, unloading during HU, normal activity for AR    <P>
The same in vivo measures were made on all animals every 28 days; specifically, pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans were made at the PTM and TD of anesthetized animals, and blood was drawn at 28-day intervals for possible serum analysis of bone activity biomarkers.    <P>
Major milestones for the anabolic pre-treatment portions of the project are summarized as follows:    <P>
July – December 2015: •	Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) completed July 2015 ; •	Receipt of initial shipment of Scl-Ab October 2015    <P>
November – December 2015: •	Pilot study for Scl-Ab dosing ; •	Pilot study for voluntary jumping exercise    <P>
January – September 2016:     <P>
•	Animal work for Scl-Ab drug pre-treatment conducted in 3 cohorts:    <P>
		Cohort 1 – 26 Jan 2016 to 22 June 2016 (20 Scl-Ab; 5 REX)    <P>
		Cohort 2 – 18 Apr 2016 to 31 Aug 2016 (13 Scl-Ab)    <P>
		Cohort 3 – 5 May 2016 to 14 Sept 2016 (12 Scl-Ab)    <P>
September – December 2016: •	Continued refinement of voluntary jumping exercise details and new cages    <P>
January 2017 – April 2018: •	Animal work for voluntary jumping exercise (REX) conducted in 4 cohorts  		Cohort 1 – 10 Jan 2017 to 16 May 2017 (10 REX)    <P>
		Cohort 2 – 13 June 2017 to 14 Nov 2017 (10 REX)    <P>
		Cohort 3 – 13 Sept 2017 to 10 Feb 2018 (10 REX)    <P>
		Cohort 4 – 12 Dec 2017 to 8 Apr 2018 (10 REX)    <P>
As reflected above, a decision was made to stagger the two parts of the anabolic pre-treatment arm of the project.  The Scl-Ab (pharmacologic) pre-treatment part was done first and was completed in September 2016.  The voluntary jumping exercise (REX) pre-treatment part was resumed in January 2017 and continued into to 2018.  Two factors prompted the strategy to stagger the Scl-Ab and REX parts of the study.  First, the duration of the window of availability for the sclerostin anti-body compound was uncertain, so it was deemed best to acquire all of the material that was promised as soon as possible and reasonable.  The second factor was that the voluntary jumping exercise required additional refinements and adjustments in order to make it practical and effective for the remaining 40 animals scheduled to conduct the jumping exercises.  Five animals were included in the first cohort of the Scl-Ab pre-treatment part, and the knowledge gained from that was used to adjust and improve the process.  Most prominently, the customized cages required for acclimating, training, and exercising the animals needed to be redesigned and new ones constructed.  Consequently, the first of the four remaining REX cohorts was not started until January 2017.  In addition, the labor-intensive nature of the jumping exercise training protocol dictates a maximum of 10 animals per cohort, as reflected in the summary above.    <P>

Two PhD students are finishing their dissertations in fall 2019 (Jessica Brezicha) and spring 2020 (Scott Lenfest).  These dissertation research projects focus on the two anabolic pre-treatments, sclerostin anti-body and voluntary jumping exercise, respectively.  Because of the sequential and inter-dependent nature of the animal experiments, outcome measures gathered, and subsequent data analyses, dissemination through journal articles has been delayed.  Publications should be readily forthcoming from the completed dissertation work of these two PhD students.  Publication of the earlier results for the two bisphosphonate drug pre-treatments is also being coordinated with publication of the anabolic pre-treatment results to permit detailed comparisons and more in-depth consideration. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research proposal is aimed at better understanding the basic bone biological effects of various osteoporosis treatments as therapies for reducing or preventing bone loss due to space flight. The project will study hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, which is a technique that is well established as an effective and informative ground-based analog for studying the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system. In order to better understand the detailed effects of each, the treatments will be studied separately. The four treatments to be examined include two anabolic (bone building) therapies and two anti-resorptive therapies. One anabolic approach will use voluntary exercise and the other a new osteoporosis drug (anti-sclerostin antibody). Anti-resorptive drugs are the most popular for treating clinical osteoporosis and achieve their benefits by preventing bone resorption, which is part of the normal cycle of bone replenishment. Furthermore, the treatments will be used as pre-treatments and only administered prior to HU exposure. This is not realistic for astronauts, but it will allow more in-depth study of the fundamental nature of each treatment, and it will also align with the anticipated requirements of possible follow-up space flight experiments using the same rat animal model. The experiments to be conducted will characterize beneficial effects of pre-treatment upon bone loss due to HU as well as bone recovery following HU and return to weightbearing. Bone properties will be quantified using CT-based analyses, histological techniques for assessing bone cell function, as well as biomechanical testing to measure strength. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Completion of the studies outlined in this research proposal will provide new insights into the basic nature of the effects of exercise and pharmaceutical agents and how these interact with mechanical unloading and recovery therefrom.  Removal of weightbearing through hindlimb unloading is a severe and acute form of mechanical disuse that has been shown to simulate many of the effects of microgravity exposure due to space flight on the musculoskeletal system. Hindlimb unloading also induces many musculoskeletal system changes that are similar to accelerated aging as well as other disuse scenarios such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular impairment.  Thus, insights gained should also help advance basic understanding of the fundamental biology associated with Earth-bound clinical medicine as well as space flight effects.  Future space flight experiments can be designed to replicate the research to be conducted in this proposed project, and comparing results from the two will provide essential and more detailed understanding of the full efficacy, as well as limitations, of the adult rat HU model as a ground-based analog for human space flight.  Studying these treatments separately is not necessarily realistic for actual mission scenarios, but the results will nevertheless provide evidence-based rational data for contemplating and designing possible co-therapies using either combinations (simultaneously) or possible sequential scheduling protocols. <P></td>

						The primary focus of effort during the current year has been on:  (a) maintaining progress on the second set of animal experiments, and (b) continuing to conduct and complete analysis of data and interpretation of results.  With reference to the experiments and specific aims as originally proposed (overviewed above), the order was reversed, and the anti-resorptive pre-treatment portion of the study was done first.  The animal work for the anabolic pre-treatment portion of the project was originally scheduled to start in Spring of 2015, but this was delayed significantly due to acquisition of the sclerostin anti-body agent and establishment of proper dosing.  Considerable time and effort were expended during year 2 on this task, and a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) was finally executed with Lilly near the very end of Year 2 (on July 24, 2015).  Accordingly, the focus of animal work during Year 3 and the current year has been on the anabolic pre-treatment part of the project.  Animal groups and generic timelines are summarized in the schematic below.    <P>
Anabolic Pre-Treatment Animal Study:   Four experimental groups are specified for each of the two sets of animal experiments.  The two anabolic pre-treatments are pharmaceutical and mechanical.  Specifically, the pharmaceutical agent used was an anti-sclerostin anti-body compound provided by Lilly (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) through a Material Transfer Agreement.  The mechanical anabolic consists of a voluntary rat jumping protocol intended to simulate resistance exercise.  The four groups for this part of the study are:    <P>
	Ambulating Control (CON) ; 	HU Control (HUC) ; Sclerostin Anti-body (SAB)	; Exercise (REX)    <P>
In vivo measures were made on all animals every 28 days.  These consist primarily of pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans conducted on anesthetized animals at the proximal tibia metaphysis (PTM) and at the tibia diaphysis (TD), or midshaft.  In addition, blood serum samples have been acquired at each 28-day interval and stored for possible future analysis of bone activity biomarkers.  A host of additional analyses are conducted ex vivo on bone specimens harvested from the animals following euthanasia at each of the time 28-day time points.    <P>
Ex Vivo Endpoint Measures:      <P>
      Densitometry and microstructure by microCT (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN); ~ trabecular microarchitecture, vBMD, BMC, TMD, etc.     <P>
     Static and dynamic histomorphometry (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN); ~ trabecular, cortical, MS/BS, MAR, BFR, etc.    <P>
     Bone Strength (tibia metaphysis RPC, midshaft; femur midshaft, FN); ~ ultimate load, stiffness, ultimate strength, elastic modulus, toughness, etc.    <P>

  Major Milestones:   Milestones are shown below summarizing the tasks and timing of effort for the current year, with some overlap going back to the latter portion of Year 3 for context and continuity.    <P>
Jan. – Sep. 2016: •	Animal work for Scl-Ab drug pre-treatment conducted in 3 cohorts:   		Cohort 1 – 26 Jan 2016 to 22 June 2016 (20 Scl-Ab; 5 REX) ; Cohort 2 – 18 Apr 2016 to 31 Aug 2016 (13 Scl-Ab) ; Cohort 3 – 5 May 2016 to 14 Sept 2016 (12 Scl-Ab)    <P>
Sep. – Dec. 2016: •	Continuing refinement of voluntary jumping exercise details and new cages ;   •	Ex Vivo analyses (pQCT, microCT, mechanical testing, histomorphometry)     <P>
Jan. – Sep. 2017: •	Animal work for voluntary jumping exercise (REX) to be conducted in 4 cohorts:   		Cohort 1 – 10 Jan 2017 to 16 May 2017 (10 REX) ; Cohort 2 – 13 June 2017 to 14 Nov 2017 (10 REX) ; Cohort 3 – 13 Sept 2017 to 10 Feb 2018 (10 REX) ; Cohort 4 – 12 Dec 2017 to 8 Apr 2018 (10 REX)    <P>
As reflected above, a decision was made to stagger the two parts of the anabolic pre-treatment arm of the project.  The Scl-Ab (pharmacologic) pre-treatment part was done first and was completed in September 2016 (the start of the current year).  The voluntary jumping exercise (REX) pre-treatment part was resumed in January 2017 and will continue into the next year (September 2017 to August 2018).  A no-cost extension is being requested to maintain spending capabilities for ordering animals and housing costs in order to complete all of the needed animal experiments.  All funds have already been received (as of April 2017).    <P>
Two factors prompted the strategy to stagger the Scl-Ab and REX parts of the study.  First, the duration of the window of availability for the sclerostin anti-body compound was uncertain, so it was deemed best to acquire all of the material that was promised as soon as possible and reasonable.  The second factor is that the voluntary jumping exercise required additional refinements and adjustments in order to make it practical and effective for the remaining 40 animals scheduled to conduct the jumping exercises.  Five animals were included in the first cohort of the Scl-Ab pre-treatment part, and the knowledge gained from that was used to adjust and improve the process.  Most prominently, the customized cages required for acclimating, training, and exercising the animals needed to be redesigned and new ones constructed.  Consequently, the first of the four remaining REX cohorts was not started until January 2017.  Further, the labor-intensive nature of the jumping exercise training protocol dictates a maximum of 10 animals per cohort, as reflected in the summary above.  The animal numbers shown above for Cohorts 1-4 of the exercise anabolic part are for the REX groups only.  There will be at least 10 more animals per cohort in order to populate additional ambulating controls (CON) and hindlimb unloaded controls (HUC) groups.  Thus, additional costs will be incurred beyond the current year end date of August 31, 2017, as follows:    <P>
•	Purchase of 40-45 more adult male rats for Cohorts 3 and 4 ; Animal housing for the remainder of Cohort 2 and all of Cohorts 3 and 4. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research proposal is aimed at better understanding the basic bone biological effects of various osteoporosis treatments as therapies for reducing or preventing bone loss due to space flight. The project will study hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, which is a technique that is well established as an effective and informative ground-based analog for studying the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system. In order to better understand the detailed effects of each, the treatments will be studied separately. The four treatments to be examined include two anabolic (bone building) therapies and two anti-resorptive therapies. One anabolic approach will use voluntary exercise and the other a new osteoporosis drug (anti-sclerostin antibody). Anti-resorptive drugs are the most popular for treating clinical osteoporosis and achieve their benefits by preventing bone resorption, which is part of the normal cycle of bone replenishment. Furthermore, the treatments will be used as pre-treatments and only administered prior to HU exposure. This is not realistic for astronauts, but it will allow more in-depth study of the fundamental nature of each treatment, and it will also align with the anticipated requirements of possible follow-up space flight experiments using the same rat animal model. The experiments to be conducted will characterize beneficial effects of pre-treatment upon bone loss due to HU as well as bone recovery following HU and return to weightbearing. Bone properties will be quantified using CT-based analyses, histological techniques for assessing bone cell function, as well as biomechanical testing to measure strength. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Completion of the studies outlined in this research proposal will provide new insights into the basic nature of the effects of exercise and pharmaceutical agents and how these interact with mechanical unloading and recovery therefrom.  Removal of weightbearing through hindlimb unloading is a severe and acute form of mechanical disuse that has been shown to simulate many of the effects of microgravity exposure due to space flight on the musculoskeletal system. Hindlimb unloading also induces many musculoskeletal system changes that are similar to accelerated aging as well as other disuse scenarios such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular impairment.  Thus, insights gained should also help advance basic understanding of the fundamental biology associated with Earth-bound clinical medicine as well as space flight effects.  Future space flight experiments can be designed to replicate the research to be conducted in this proposed project, and comparing results from the two will provide essential and more detailed understanding of the full efficacy, as well as limitations, of the adult rat HU model as a ground-based analog for human space flight.  Studying these treatments separately is not necessarily realistic for actual mission scenarios, but the results will nevertheless provide evidence-based rational data for contemplating and designing possible co-therapies using either combinations (simultaneously) or possible sequential scheduling protocols. <P></td>

						The primary focus of effort during year 3 was on conducting (and completing) the second set of animal experiments.  With reference to the experiments and specific aims as originally proposed (overviewed above), the order was reversed, and the anti-resorptive pre-treatment portion of the study was done first (Year 2).  Accordingly, the focus for year 3 was on the anabolic  Animal groups and timelines are summarized below.    <P>
Anabolic Pre-Treatment Animal Study:   Four experimental groups are specified for each of the two sets of animal experiments.  The two anabolic pre-treatments are pharmaceutical and mechanical.  Specifically, the pharmaceutical agent used was an anti-sclerostin anti-body compound provided by Lilly (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) through a Material Transfer Agreement.  The mechanical anabolic consists of a voluntary rat jumping protocol intended to simulate resistance exercise.  The four groups for this part of the study are thus:    <P>
Control (CON)    ;     HU Control (HUC)  Sclerostin Anti-body (SAB)    ;    Exercise (REX)    <P>
In vivo measures were made on all animals every 28 days.  These consist primarily of pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans conducted on anesthetized animals at the proximal tibia metaphysis (PTM) and at the tibia diaphysis (TD), or midshaft.  In addition, blood serum samples have been acquired at each 28-day interval and stored for possible future analysis of bone activity biomarkers.  A host of additional analyses are conducted ex vivo on bone specimens harvested from the animals following euthanasia at each of the time 28-day time points.    <P>
Ex Vivo Endpoint Measures:          Densitometry and microstructure by microCT (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN):   	~ trabecular microarchitecture, vBMD, BMC, TMD, etc.     <P>
     Static and dynamic histomorphometry (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN):   	~ trabecular, cortical, MS/BS, MAR, BFR, etc.    <P>
     Bone Strength (tibia metaphysis RPC, midshaft; femur midshaft, FN):  	~ ultimate load, stiffness, ultimate strength, elastic modulus, toughness, etc.    <P>
     Muscle Weights (hindlimb posterior crural muscles):   	~ wet weights for gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris    <P>
The animal work for the anabolic pre-treatment portion of the project was originally scheduled to start in Spring of 2015, but this was delayed significantly due to acquisition of the anti-sclerostin anti-body agent and establishment of proper dosing.  Considerable time and effort were expended during year 2 on this task, and a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) was finally executed with Lilly near the very end of Year 3 (on July 24, 2015).  Milestones are shown below highlighting the tasks and timing of effort for Year 3.  The first several months were devoted to two pilot studies:    	(1)  to determine proper doses for efficacy of the rat version of this drug for the strain, age, and gender (male) animals being used in this project; and   	(2)  to continue development of jumping exercise protocol details.    <P>
Both of these pilot studies were successful and laid the necessary groundwork for planning and conducting the primary animal studies.  The dose suggested by Lilly (1 x per week 25mg/kg body weight) proved to be effective over 28 days of pre-treatment.  The pilot studies did not include any hindlimb unloading (HU) periods; that is, they ended after 28 days of pre-treatment.  The main focus of the exercise pilot study was to establish details for the minor food restriction needed to train the animals.  The voluntary training protocol relies on slight food restriction in order to enhance the effectiveness of food "treats" as the positive reinforcement.  The goal was to establish the amount of treats needed for effective training while also making sure the animals maintained healthy body weights.    <P>
Following the pilot studies, a decision was made to to stagger the animal experiments for the drug (Scl-Ab) and for the exercise.  This was based on a combination of several factors.  First, this project specifies adult male Sprague-Dawley rats 5.5 to 6 months old, and the vendor requires considerable lead time in order to provide aged animals, especially considering that a total of 140-150 animals are needed.  Further, the jumping exercise is very labor intensive and still needed more pilot work for additional refinement and finalizing of procedural details, particularly for establishing efficacy during HU exposure following pre-treatment.  In addition, the logistical arrangements with Lilly necessitated acquiring and using the Scl-Ab drug early in calendar year 2016.  Consequently, all of the animal work for the Scl-Ab pre-treatment was done first and in 3 cohorts.  The first of these cohorts included 5 animals for finalizing the jumping exercise pre-treatment protocol and generation of proof-of-concept data.  Because of the cumulative delays in conducting the anabolic pre-treatment arm of the project, a request was made and granted for a 1-year no-cost extension.  The end date of the project is now August 31, 2017.  Accordingly, the milestones for Year 3 can be summarized as follows:    <P>
Major Milestones for Year 3    <P>
Oct. 2016:    Receipt of initial shipment of Scl-Ab    <P>
Nov. – Dec. 2016:    Pilot study for Scl-Ab dosing;    Pilot study for voluntary jumping exercise    <P>
Jan. – Sep. 2016:    Animal work for Scl-Ab drug pre-treatment conducted in 3 cohorts-- Cohort 1 – 26 Jan 2016 to 22 June 2016 (20 Scl-Ab; 5 REX);  Cohort 2 – 18 Apr 2016 to 31 Aug 2016 (13 Scl-Ab);  Cohort 3 – 5 May 2016 to 14 Sept 2016 (12 Scl-Ab)    <P>
May 2016:  No-Cost Extension Granted (1 year)    <P>
Throughout the duration of year 3 progress was also maintained on ex vivo measures and analyses for the first part of the project, the anti-resorptive drug pre-treatment arm. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research proposal is aimed at better understanding the basic bone biological effects of various osteoporosis treatments as therapies for reducing or preventing bone loss due to space flight. The project will study hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, which is a technique that is well established as an effective and informative ground-based analog for studying the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system. In order to better understand the detailed effects of each, the treatments will be studied separately. The four treatments to be examined include two anabolic (bone building) therapies and two anti-resorptive therapies. One anabolic approach will use voluntary exercise and the other a new osteoporosis drug (anti-sclerostin antibody). Anti-resorptive drugs are the most popular for treating clinical osteoporosis and achieve their benefits by preventing bone resorption, which is part of the normal cycle of bone replenishment. Furthermore, the treatments will be used as pre-treatments and only administered prior to HU exposure. This is not realistic for astronauts, but it will allow more in-depth study of the fundamental nature of each treatment, and it will also align with the anticipated requirements of possible follow-up space flight experiments using the same rat animal model. The experiments to be conducted will characterize beneficial effects of pre-treatment upon bone loss due to HU as well as bone recovery following HU and return to weightbearing. Bone properties will be quantified using CT-based analyses, histological techniques for assessing bone cell function, as well as biomechanical testing to measure strength. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Completion of the studies outlined in this research proposal will provide new insights into the basic nature of the effects of exercise and pharmaceutical agents and how these interact with mechanical unloading and recovery therefrom.  Removal of weightbearing through hindlimb unloading is a severe and acute form of mechanical disuse that has been shown to simulate many of the effects of microgravity exposure due to space flight on the musculoskeletal system. Hindlimb unloading also induces many musculoskeletal system changes that are similar to accelerated aging as well as other disuse scenarios such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular impairment.  Thus, insights gained should also help advance basic understanding of the fundamental biology associated with Earth-bound clinical medicine as well as space flight effects.  Future space flight experiments can be designed to replicate the research to be conducted in this proposed project, and comparing results from the two will provide essential and more detailed understanding of the full efficacy, as well as limitations, of the adult rat HU model as a ground-based analog for human space flight.  Studying these treatments separately is not necessarily realistic for actual mission scenarios, but the results will nevertheless provide evidence-based rational data for contemplating and designing possible co-therapies using either combinations (simultaneously) or possible sequential scheduling protocols. <P></td>

						The primary focus of effort during year 2 was on conducting (and completing) the first set of animal experiments.  With reference to the experiments and specific aims as originally proposed (overviewed above), the order was reversed, and the anti-resorptive pre-treatment portion of the study was done first.  Animal groupings and timelines are summarized below.    <P>
  Anti-Resorptive Pre-Treatment Animal Study    <P>
Four experimental groups are specified for each of the two sets of animal experiments.  The two anti-resorptive pre-treatments are both bisphosphonate drugs, specifically risedronate and alendronate.  The four groups for this part of the study were thus:    <P>
Control (CON),   HU Control (HUC),   Risedronate (RIS),   Alendronate (ALN).    <P>
The general framework for the experimental animal protocols consists of four 28-day periods.  During the first 28-day period, animals in the RIS and ALN groups are treated with the respective bisphosphonate anti-resorptive drug.  Animals in the HUC, RIS, and ALN groups undergo hindlimb unloading during the second 28-day period.  Animals in all four groups resume normal weightbearing for the final two 28-day periods.    <P>
These experiments were conducted in three cohorts of animals due to constraints and considerations associated with animal housing space, animal cages, and personnel requirements.  Each cohort involved 45-50 animals, with the timetable as follows:    <P>
			Cohort 1 – 27 May 2014 to 9 Oct 2014 ; Cohort 2 – 15 July 2014 to 25 Nov 2014; Cohort 3 – 30 Sept 2014 to 10 Feb 2015.    <P>
In vivo measures are being made on all animals every 28 days.  The main assessment conducted was pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans, which were made at the proximal tibia of anesthetized animals.  In addition, blood serum samples have been acquired at each 28-day interval and stored for possible future analysis of bone activity biomarkers.  A host of additional analyses will be conducted ex vivo on bone specimens harvested from the animals following sacrifice at each of the time 28-day time points.  Selected results have been generated to date, but most of these will require additional time for completion.  As outlined in the original research proposal, the following ex vivo results will be generated:    <P>
Ex Vivo Endpoint Measures:     <P>
     Densitometry and microstructure by microCT (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN)  	~ trabecular microarchitecture, vBMD, BMC, TMD, etc.     <P>
     Static and dynamic histomorphometry (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN)  	~ trabecular, cortical, MS/BS, MAR, BFR, etc.    <P>
     Bone Strength (tibia metaphysis RPC, midshaft; femur midshaft, FN)  	~ ultimate load, stiffness, ultimate strength, elastic modulus, toughness, etc.    <P>
     Muscle Weights (hindlimb posterior crural muscles)  	~ wet weights for gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris    <P>
  Anabolic Pre-Treatment Animal Study    <P>
The anabolic pre-treatments to be compared consist of a pharmacological agent (anti-sclerostin anti-body) and a resistance exercise protocol.  Accordingly, the four groups are as follows:    <P>
Control (CON), HU Control (HUC), Scl Antibody (SAB), Resistance Exercise (REX).    <P>
The animal work for the anabolic pre-treatment portion of the project was originally scheduled to start in Spring of 2015, but this is now planned for Fall of 2015.  The main reason for the delay has been acquisition of the anti-sclerostin anti-body agent.  Considerable time and effort have been expended during year 2 on this task, and a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) has finally been executed with Lilly on July 24, 2015.  The process can now move forward to order animals and schedule the start of the animal experiments.  Four cohorts of animals will be used for this phase of the study (instead of three as before) due to the labor-intensive nature of the resistance exercise protocol.  The research plan specifies adult male Sprague-Dawley rats 5.5 to 6 months old, and the vendor requires considerable lead time in order to provide aged animals, especially considering that a total of 140-150 animals are needed.  Determination of the precise start date for the animal work will depend on these factors plus the actual delivery date for the drug. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research proposal is aimed at better understanding the basic bone biological effects of various osteoporosis treatments as therapies for reducing or preventing bone loss due to space flight. The project will study hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, which is a technique that is well established as an effective and informative ground-based analog for studying the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system. In order to better understand the detailed effects of each, the treatments will be studied separately. The four treatments to be examined include two anabolic (bone building) therapies and two anti-resorptive therapies. One anabolic approach will use voluntary exercise and the other a new osteoporosis drug (anti-sclerostin antibody). Anti-resorptive drugs are the most popular for treating clinical osteoporosis and achieve their benefits by preventing bone resorption, which is part of the normal cycle of bone replenishment. Furthermore, the treatments will be used as pre-treatments and only administered prior to HU exposure. This is not realistic for astronauts, but it will allow more in-depth study of the fundamental nature of each treatment, and it will also align with the anticipated requirements of possible follow-up space flight experiments using the same rat animal model. The experiments to be conducted will characterize beneficial effects of pre-treatment upon bone loss due to HU as well as bone recovery following HU and return to weightbearing. Bone properties will be quantified using CT-based analyses, histological techniques for assessing bone cell function, as well as biomechanical testing to measure strength. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Completion of the studies outlined in this research proposal will provide new insights into the basic nature of the effects of exercise and pharmaceutical agents and how these interact with mechanical unloading and recovery therefrom.  Removal of weightbearing through hindlimb unloading is a severe and acute form of mechanical disuse that has been shown to simulate many of the effects of microgravity exposure due to space flight on the musculoskeletal system. Hindlimb unloading also induces many musculoskeletal system changes that are similar to accelerated aging as well as other disuse scenarios such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or neuromuscular impairment.  Thus, insights gained should also help advance basic understanding of the fundamental biology associated with Earth-bound clinical medicine as well as space flight effects.  Future space flight experiments can be designed to replicate the research to be conducted in this proposed project, and comparing results from the two will provide essential and more detailed understanding of the full efficacy, as well as limitations, of the adult rat HU model as a ground-based analog for human space flight.  Studying these treatments separately is not necessarily realistic for actual mission scenarios, but the results will nevertheless provide evidence-based rational data for contemplating and designing possible co-therapies using either combinations (simultaneously) or possible sequential scheduling protocols. <P></td>

						Most of the effort during the first several months of the project was spent seeking final and complete approvals from the university IACUC and laboratory safety offices.  Orders for the animals could not be placed until these approvals were secured.  Further delays ensued due to the number of animals needed and the age required.  The research plan specifies adult male Sprague-Dawley rats 5.5 to 6 months old, and the vendor requires considerable lead time in order to provide aged animals, especially considering that a total of 140-150 animals are needed for each of the two sets of animal protocols.  Given these constraints, the first cohort of animals did not arrive until late May of 2014, which was nearly 9 months into year 1 of the project.    <P>
Another adjustment made during year 1 was to reverse the order of the two animal experiments.  In the proposal, the first set of animal studies (Experiment 1) was to address Specific Aim 1, which compares two anabolic pre-treatments, but we have decided to change this to address Specific Aim 2 instead.  One major consideration in this change is simply to allow more time to acquire the Sclerostin-Antibody drug, which will be the pharmacological anabolic treatment (with exercise being the other anabolic).  Contacts have been initiated with one pharmaceutical company to this end.    <P>
  Anti-Resorptive Pre-Treatment Animal Work:   Four experimental groups are needed for each of the two sets of animal experiments.  The two anti-resorptive pre-treatments are both bisphosphonate drugs, specifically risedronate and alendronate.  The four groups are defined as follows: Control (CON), HU Control (HUC), Risedronate (RIS), Alendronate (ALN).    <P>
The general framework for the experimental animal protocols consists of four 28-day periods.  During the first 28-day period, animals in the RIS and ALN groups will be treated with the respective bisphosphonate anti-resorptive drug.  Animals in the HUC, RIS, and ALN groups will undergo hindlimb unloading during the second 28-day period.  Animals in all four groups will resume normal weightbearing for the final two 28-day periods.    <P>
These experiments have already started and are being conducted in three cohorts of animals due to constraints and considerations associated with animal housing space, animal cages, and personnel requirements.  Each cohort involves 45-50 animals, and the timetable is as follows: Cohort 1 – 27 May 2014 to 9 Oct 2014; Cohort 2 – 15 July 2014 to 25 Nov 2014; Cohort 3 – 30 Sept 2014 to 10 Feb 2015.    <P>
In vivo measures are being made on all animals every 28 days.  The main assessment being conducted is pQCT (peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans, which are made at the proximal tibia of anesthetized animals.  These data are being compiled as generated and will be analyzed as the number of animals in each group increases with each cohort.  In addition, blood is being drawn at 28-day intervals for possible serum analysis of bone activity biomarkers.    <P>
Anabolic Pre-Treatment Animal Work:   The animal work for the first set of animal experiments will conclude in February of 2015, and shortly after this, the animal studies will be initiated for the second set of experiments (anabolic pre-treatments).  Details of these protocols and schedules are already being planned and established.  In this case, one of the anabolic pre-treaments will be pharmacological (sclerostin antibody drug) and the other will utilize a resistance exercise protocol.  Accordingly, the four groups to be studied will be defined as follows: Control (CON), HU Control (HUC), Scl Antibody (SAB), Resistance Exercise (REX).    <P>
Once again, three different cohorts of animals will be used to complete these animal experiments.  The first cohort will start in February or March of 2015.    <P>
All animal work is currently progressing smoothly and without excessive complications.  We therefore do not anticipate any more delays of any significance or consequence.  It should be pointed out, however, that many of the analyses will be conducted ex vivo on bone specimens harvested from the animals following euthanasia, so there will be a commensurate time lag following the completion of animal work for both of the two sets of experiments.  As outlined in the original research proposal, the following results will be generated:    <P>
Ex Vivo Endpoint Measures:          Densitometry and microstructure by microCT (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN):   	~ trabecular microarchitecture, vBMD, BMC, TMD, etc.     <P>
     Static and dynamic histomorphometry (tibia and femur; metaphyses, midshaft, FN):   	~ trabecular, cortical, MS/BS, MAR, BFR, etc.    <P>
     Bone Strength (tibia metaphysis RPC, midshaft; femur midshaft, FN):   	~ ultimate load, stiffness, ultimate strength, elastic modulus, toughness, etc.    <P>
     Muscle Weights (hindlimb posterior crural muscles):   	~ wet weights for gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research proposal is aimed at better understanding the basic bone biological effects of various osteoporosis treatments as therapies for reducing or preventing bone loss due to space flight. The project will study hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, which is a technique that is well established as an effective and informative ground-based analog for studying the effects of space flight on the musculoskeletal system. In order to better understand the detailed effects of each, the treatments will be studied separately. The four treatments to be examined include two anabolic (bone building) therapies and two anti-resorptive therapies. One anabolic approach will use voluntary exercise and the other a new osteoporosis drug (anti-sclerostin antibody). Anti-resorptive drugs are the most popular for treating clinical osteoporosis and achieve their benefits by preventing bone resorption, which is part of the normal cycle of bone replenishment. Furthermore, the treatments will be used as pre-treatments and only administered prior to HU exposure. This is not realistic for astronauts, but it will allow more in-depth study of the fundamental nature of each treatment, and it will also align with the anticipated requirements of possible follow-up space flight experiments using the same rat animal model. The experiments to be conducted will characterize beneficial effects of pre-treatment upon bone loss due to HU as well as bone recovery following HU and return to weightbearing. Bone properties will be quantified using CT-based analyses, histological techniques for assessing bone cell function, as well as biomechanical testing to measure strength. <P></td>
