                    <td colspan="3"> NNX15AB45G was funded in 2014 in response to section B.7 - Special topic - ISS Rodent Tissue Sharing Opportunity announced as part of NRA (NASA Research Announcement) NNH14ZTT001N.   NASA indicated that a total of 20 mice were planned to be flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and 40 mice would serve as ground controls.  Four immunization treatment groups were part of the experimental protocol that was designed to assess the in vivo antibody responses during spaceflight.  In particular, the antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each of the treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatments.  Our group (Pecaut and Chapes) proposed to collect mouse liver, bone marrow, kidney/adrenal glands, and thymus to accomplish two specific aims.      <P>
1.  Specific Aim 1:  Collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  These tissues would have been used to assess short- and long-term stress to the flight animals.       <P>
2.  Specific Aim 2:  Collect liver and bone marrow.   These tissues would be used for the preparation of RNA to allow for a comparative analysis of B cell IgH usage between lymphoid compartments.      <P>
With the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and > or = 2 year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved to modify the aims of NNX15AB45G as follows:      <P>
1.  Obtain liver tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research 1 (RR1) verification flight.  Preflight verification tests done as part of NNX15AB45G have shown that usable RNA cannot be obtained from bone marrow from frozen carcasses (using the freezing procedure currently used on ISS).  Therefore, we proposed to focus on liver tissue.  Liver RNA was available from the liver tissue (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 AEM ground controls).  We proposed to do MiSeq next generation sequencing on a group of flight and ground samples.  In addition, NASA GeneLab had done HiSeq next generation sequencing on some of the liver tissue flown on RR1.  We proposed to obtain those data. We proposed to determine IgH usage of the liver B cells in the mice (flight vs. ground controls).  One of our goals is to determine if there is tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.      <P>
2.  An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) was proposed to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight (This experiment will be done as part of NNX13AN34G).  In this protocol, mice will be subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice will be immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS, CpG only, tetanus toxoid (TT) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections will be intraperitoneal (i.p.). Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we will obtain liver tissue from those mice.  We will directly assess the changes in IgH usage caused by immunization ± adjuvant (CpG) and will address the impact of skeletal unloading. One of our original goals was to examine the impact of spaceflight on host B cell responsiveness in different tissue compartments.  Therefore, this experiment was expected to partially fulfill the goals of Aim 1 of the original grant by using AOS as a spaceflight model.  We proposed to  compare the impact of skeletal unloading using AOS on host responsiveness to antigen challenge and address the issue of tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.       In addition to the IgH usage studies, we proposed to collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  The data obtained from these tissue analyses will be used to assess short- and long-term stress to AOS animals. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Spaceflight offers a unique environment that impacts many physiological systems. This occurs not only in humans but also in rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.  Among these systems, bone and the immune response are connected and are known to be significantly altered by the skeletal unloading of spaceflight.  B lymphocytes are one of the cells that develop in the bone marrow.  They make antibodies in response to infection or immunization with vaccines.  Moreover, the B cells that protect people from disease after receiving immunizations localize to the bone marrow as well as other lymphoid organs.  We will obtain valuable information about what changes occur in the B-cell populations that develop in lymphoid organs such as liver and compare the development of these B-cell populations found in other lymphoid compartments.  This understanding will tell us if more precautions are necessary on Earth when people are skeletally unloaded.  On Earth, skeletal unloading occurs to individuals that are bedridden for long periods of time, wheel-chair bound, or lose the ability to stand for long periods of time.  Therefore, the space environment provides an accelerated view of what will happen to individuals that must endure these prolonged periods of skeletal unloading.   This experiment will have direct relevance to individuals on Earth. <P></td>

						Work Completed to accomplish Specific Aim 1    <P>
Analysis of Rodent Research 1 liver data      <P>
We analyzed GeneLab data sequencing data that was available from the GeneLab data base, GLDS-47, GLDS-48.  The number of immunoglobulin reads (either heavy or light chain) were quite low, less than 1% of what we had obtained in preliminary analysis of spleen cells and tissue.  We first attributed this low yield to short sequencing reads from the HiSeq sequencing method that the GeneLab did and provided in the database.  Therefore, we sequenced both splenic (funded by another grant) and liver RNA from the Rodent Research 1 (RR1) validation flight, which was made available by the NASA Ames Research Center (n=3 ground, n=3 flight). RNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (275bp, 2x) at the Kansas State Integrated Genomics Facility. Sequencing data was quality trimmed using CLC genomics workbench and mapped to reference libraries obtained from ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database. Datasets were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for CDR3 characterization.       <P>
The analysis of liver vs. spleen reads indicated that liver immunoglobulin gene reads range from 0.26% of spleen immunoglobulin gene reads to 0.91%.  The number of reads ranges from less than 100 to no greater than 622, depending on the sample.  Although useful, publishable data from the spleen was obtained (data presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, Poster #120, and presented in the GeneLab workshop by Chapes and Ward) and the liver sequencing did not provide much usable meaningful immunoglobulin gene data, even when the more comprehensive MiSeq next generation sequencing platform is used to sequence.  The liver data that we did obtain was published in our publication on the RR1 flight (Life Sciences in Space Research, 2018--See Bibliography section below).  Other data from the MiSeq NGS data sets will be useful for other data mining attempts and was made available to the GeneLab.  Therefore, these sequencing runs will provide a rich data source.        <P>
Assessment of the bone marrow B-cell repertoire    <P>
Because our specific aim to examine the liver for IgH V, D, and J gene segment usage and IgL for V and J gene segment was not successful, we received permission to assess bone marrow.  Bone marrow is an important, essential immune compartment for the storage of B cell plasma and memory cells (Erickson, Lin et al. 2003; Cariappa, Chase et al. 2007).  Although preflight verification tests indicated that sequence quality RNA could not be obtained from bone marrow from frozen carcasses (using the freezing procedure currently used on ISS), usable, bone marrow RNA was obtained from the mice used in the AOS experiment.      <P>
We used skeletal unloading with the antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) model to simulate some of the physiological effects associated with spaceflight. Loaded and unloaded animals were challenged with tetanus toxoid (TT) and/or CpG, an adjuvant.  Two weeks after challenge, bone marrow was collected and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq 2x300 platform. The resulting antibody repertoire was characterized, including V-, D- (heavy only), and J-gene segment usage, constant region usage, CDR3 length, and V(D)J combinations. We detected changes in gene-segment usage in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatment in both the heavy and light chains. Additionally, changes were seen in the class-switched VH-gene repertoire. Alterations were also detected in V/J pairing for both the heavy and light chains, and changes in CDR3 length. We also detected lower levels of CDR3 AA overlap than detected in the splenic repertoire. These results demonstrate that AOS, TT, and CpG altered the bone marrow antibody repertoire.     <P>
When we compared the bone marrow repertoire to the spleen B cell repertoire, there appear to be some differences in the bone marrow repertoire compared to the spleen.  However, there was no evidence to suggest that AOS has a significant negative impact on the natural B cell responses or the Ig rearrangements that normally occur in response to antigen treatment in the bone marrow.  Additional spleen and bone marrow comparisons are planned in the future and some antigen specific VDJ gene combinations that are necessary for TT-specific responses will also be assessed in the future.    <P>
A manuscript entitled “Effects of skeletal unloading on the bone marrow antibody repertoire of tetanus toxoid and/or CpG treated C57BL/6J mice” is in preparation at the time of the submission of this report and will be submitted in March 2019.      <P>
Assessment of the mouse B-cell repertoire in normal mice flown to the ISS     <P>
As part of our RR1 work and specific aim 1, we utilized high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the ISS during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals; however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Ig (kappa) gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that spaceflight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.  Therefore, we successfully completed our modified specific aim one and we were able to successfully characterize immunoglobulin gene segment usage and junctional diversity within the antibody repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6Tac mice flown aboard the ISS.   Although individual gene segment usage remained similar among animals within and among treatment groups, with the most abundant gene segments being conserved across all animals, gene segment combinations and CDR3 sequences were highly varied, demonstrating the combinatorial diversity of the antibody repertoire, but that variation reflects the dynamics of individualized selection of Ig molecules and not any impact of spaceflight. A larger sample size would help solidify this conclusion, but these data provide preliminary suggestions that the recombinatorial processes that lead to the diverse Ig repertoires in mice are not affected by a short trip to and stay on the ISS. These data do not preclude that differences in the Ig repertoires of ground and flight animals might occur during during active immunization or in younger, possibly more recombinatorily active mice.    <P>
Work Completed to accomplish Specific Aim 2    <P>
Completion of Antiorthostatic Suspension Experiment    <P>
An AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during spaceflight (Chapes, Mastro et al. 1993) (Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]; Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we obtained both spleen and liver tissue from those mice.  This protocol was followed so that when mice are flown to ISS in the future, we will have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables.     <P>
Understanding the normal, C57BL/6J mouse B-cell repertoire    <P>
In preparation for the AOS, to understand the normal repertoire of the C57BL/6 mouse we studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presented a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.     Work completed for Specific Aims 1 and 2      <P>
We completed studies to validate methods to handle tissues from ISS, validate bioinformatics work flow, and the validation using next generation sequencing without amplification.  This work was necessary for the completion of Aims 1 and 2.      <P>
Validation of methods to assess the immunoglobulin gene repertoire in tissues obtained from mice on the International Space Station    <P>
Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools were available to assess antibody repertoires.  We could identify immunoglobulin gene-segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. However, due to limitations on the ISS, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed.   Therefore, some of our work had to validate that we could obtain usable biological material to complete our analyses.  To this end, our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. We also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Ig (kappa) variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq (data from RR1 mice from GeneLab) and MiSeq datasets, which we generated ourselves, and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and we produced a data set that provided other data mining options. We validated our workflow by comparing our normal mouse MiSeq data to existing murine antibody repertoire studies validating it for future antibody repertoire studies.    <P>
Characterization of the naive murine antibody repertoire using unamplified high-throughput sequencing    <P>
Sequencing of the antibody repertoire has steadily become cheaper and easier for researchers. These sequencing methods rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. In an effort to eliminate potential biases and create data sets that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs. total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission.  We determined that the use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase or primer usage had no statistical effects on read count.  Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. We also determined that although the unique CR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, it detected most of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> NNX15AB45G was funded in 2014 in response to section B.7 - Special topic - ISS Rodent Tissue Sharing Opportunity announced as part of NRA NNH14ZTT001N.   NASA indicated that a total of 20 mice were planned to be flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and 40 mice would serve as ground controls.  Four immunization treatment groups were part of the experimental protocol that was designed to assess the in vivo antibody responses during spaceflight.  In particular, the antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each of the treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatments.  Our group (Pecaut and Chapes) proposed to collect mouse liver, bone marrow, kidney/adrenal glands, and thymus to accomplish two specific aims.      <P>
1.  Specific Aim 1:  Collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  These tissues would have been used to assess short- and long-term stress to the flight animals.       <P>
2.  Specific Aim 2:  Collect liver and bone marrow.   These tissues would be used for the preparation of RNA to allow for a comparative analysis of B cell IgH usage between lymphoid compartments.      <P>
With the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and > or = 2 year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved to modify the aims of NNX15AB45G as follows:      <P>
1.  Obtain liver tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research 1 (RR1) verification flight.  Preflight verification tests done as part of NNX15AB45G have shown that usable RNA cannot be obtained from bone marrow from frozen carcasses (using the freezing procedure currently used on ISS).  Therefore, we proposed to focus on liver tissue.  Liver RNA was available from the liver tissue (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 AEM ground controls).  We proposed to do MiSeq next generation sequencing on a group of flight and ground samples.  In addition, NASA Gene Lab had done HiSeq next generation sequencing on some of the liver tissue flown on RR1.  We proposed to obtain those data. We proposed to determine IgH usage of the liver B cells in the mice (flight vs. ground controls).  One of our goals is to determine if there is tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.      <P>
2.  An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) was proposed to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight (This experiment will be done as part of NNX13AN34G).  In this protocol, mice will be subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice will be immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS, CpG only, tetanus toxoid (TT) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections will be intraperitoneal (i.p.). Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we will obtain liver tissue from those mice.  We will directly assess the changes in IgH usage caused by immunization ± adjuvant (CpG) and will address the impact of skeletal unloading. One of our original goals was to examine the impact of spaceflight on host B cell responsiveness in different tissue compartments.  Therefore, this experiment was expected to partially fulfill the goals of Aim 1 of the original grant by using AOS as a spaceflight model.  We proposed to  compare the impact of skeletal unloading using AOS on host responsiveness to antigen challenge and address the issue of tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.       In addition to the IgH usage studies, we proposed to collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  The data obtained from these tissue analyses will be used to assess short- and long-term stress to AOS animals. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Spaceflight offers a unique environment that impacts many physiological systems. This occurs not only in humans but also in rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.  Among these systems, bone and the immune response are connected and are known to be significantly altered by the skeletal unloading of spaceflight.  B lymphocytes are one of the cells that develop in the bone marrow.  They make antibodies in response to infection or immunization with vaccines.  Moreover, the B cells that protect people from disease after receiving immunizations localize to the bone marrow as well as other lymphoid organs.  We will obtain valuable information about what changes occur in the B-cell populations that develop in lymphoid organs such as liver and compare the development of these B-cell populations found in other lymphoid compartments.  This understanding will tell us if more precautions are necessary on Earth when people are skeletally unloaded.  On Earth, skeletal unloading occurs to individuals that are bedridden for long periods of time, wheel-chair bound, or lose the ability to stand for long periods of time.  Therefore, the space environment provides an accelerated view of what will happen to individuals that must endure these prolonged periods of skeletal unloading.   This experiment will have direct relevance to individuals on Earth. <P></td>

						Analysis of Rodent Research 1 data.      <P>
We analyzed gene lab sequencing data that was available from the data base, GLDS-47, GLDS-48.  The number of immunoglobulin reads (either heavy or light chain were low; less than 1% of spleen cells and tissue).  We first attributed this low yield to short sequencing reads from the HiSeq sequencing method that the GeneLab did and provided in the database.  Therefore, we sequenced both splenic (funded by another grant) and liver RNA from the Rodent Research 1 (RR1) validation flight, which was made available by the NASA Ames Research Center (n=3 ground, n=3 flight). RNA was sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (300bp, 2x) at the Kansas State Integrated Genomics Facility. Sequencing data was quality trimmed using CLC genomics workbench and mapped to reference libraries obtained from ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene database. Datasets were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for CDR3 characterization.  The analysis of liver vs. spleen reads indicated that liver immunoglobulin gene reads range from 0.26% of spleen immunoglobulin gene reads to 0.91%.  These data were presented in more detail in a previous progress report.  The number of reads ranged from less than 100 to no greater than 622, depending on the sample.  Although useful, publishable data from the spleen can be obtained (preliminary data presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, 2016, Poster #120 and presented in the GeneLab workshop by Chapes and Ward) that the liver sequencing did not provide a very useful data set, even when the more comprehensive MiSeq next generation sequencing platform was used to sequence.  Of the data obtained, the liver kappa chain V-gene repertoire did correlate some with the usage in the spleen and probably reflects circulating B-cell Ig expression but we decided to switch our focus to the bone marrow (see below).  The liver experiment was a component in a paper recently submitted for publication.  Although the liver data turned out to be of minimal value for doing tissue comparisons.  Other data from the MiSeq NGS data sets will be useful for other data mining attempts and will be made available to the GeneLab by the end of September 2017.  Our bioinformatics analyses of these data sets and the description of our bioinformatics workflow was published in Gravitational Space Research, 5(1):2-23, 2017.  This work was also highlighted on the cover of GSR ( <a target="_blank" href="http://gravitationalandspacebiology.org/index.php/journal">http://gravitationalandspacebiology.org/index.php/journal</a>  ).    <P>
An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) was proposed to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during space flight (This experiment was  done in conjunction with Dr. Pecaut, NNX13AN34G).  Mice were subjected to AOS.  Two weeks after the start of unloading, mice were immunized (i.p.) in 1 of 4 ways; PBS, CpG only, tetanus toxoid (TT) only, and TT with CpG.  Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we obtained liver tissue from those mice.  We proposed to assess the changes in immunoglobulin gene usage caused by immunization ± adjuvant (CpG) and wanted to address the impact of skeletal unloading.  One of our original goals was to examine the impact of spaceflight on host B cell responsiveness in different tissue compartments.  Spleen tissue was to be analyzed.  Therefore, this experiment (NNX15AB45G) was proposed to attempt to see how using AOS as a space flight model would affect host responsiveness to antigen challenge and would have allowed a comparison of spleen and liver tissue (tissue specificity).       <P>
Progress    <P>
Completion of Antiorthostatic Suspension (AOS) Experiment.  The AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during space flight (Chapes, Mastro et al. 1993) (Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 [5 mice per treatment group] ; Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we obtained both spleen and liver tissue from those mice.  This protocol was followed so that when mice are flown to ISS in the future, we will have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables.  Some of these data were recently presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (Poster #67).  Our original aims were to determine if there was tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage along with assessing the impact of space flight on immunoglobulin gene usage.  Bone marrow is an important, essential immune compartment for the storage of B cell plasma and memory cells (Erickson, Lin et al. 2003; Cariappa, Chase et al. 2007).  Therefore, we were approved to shift our efforts to examine the bone marrow that was collected from an AOS mouse experiment that was done as part of another project NNX13AN34G.  Bone marrow RNA has been isolated from AOS samples and RNA has been submitted for sequencing at the Integrated Genomics Facility at Kansas State University.  These sequences are now being completed and analyzed and we were able to identify Ig sequences in the bone marrow suitable for analysis.   32-bone marrow samples will be sequenced and analyzed in the coming months.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> NNX15AB45G was funded in 2014 in response to section B.7 - Special topic - ISS Rodent Tissue Sharing Opportunity announced as part of NRA NNH14ZTT001N.   NASA indicated that a total of 20 mice were planned to be flown to the International Space Station (ISS) and 40 mice would serve as ground controls.  Four immunization treatment groups were part of the experimental protocol that was designed to assess the in vivo antibody responses during spaceflight.  In particular, the antibody response and the B cell immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) repertoire would be determined in the splenic B cells from each of the treatment groups and compared among flight and ground treatments.  Our group (Pecaut and Chapes) proposed to collect mouse liver, bone marrow, kidney/adrenal glands, and thymus to accomplish two specific aims.      <P>
1.  Specific Aim 1:  Collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  These tissues would have been used to assess short- and long-term stress to the flight animals.       <P>
2.  Specific Aim 2:  Collect liver and bone marrow.   These tissues would be used for the preparation of RNA to allow for a comparative analysis of B cell IgH usage between lymphoid compartments.      <P>
With the loss of astronaut work time assigned to Space Biology and > or = 2 year delay in the transport of mice to the International Space Station, we were approved to modify the aims of NNX15AB45G as follows:      <P>
1.  Obtain liver tissue/RNA from the mice flown on Rodent Research 1 (RR1) verification flight.  Preflight verification tests done as part of NNX15AB45G have shown that usable RNA cannot be obtained from bone marrow from frozen carcasses (using the freezing procedure currently used on ISS).  Therefore, we proposed to focus on liver tissue.  Liver RNA was available from the liver tissue (10 mice; 5 flight and 5 AEM ground controls).  We proposed to do MiSeq next generation sequencing on a group of flight and ground samples.  In addition, NASA Gene Lab had done HiSeq next generation sequencing on some of the liver tissue flown on RR1.  We proposed to obtain those data. We proposed to determine IgH usage of the liver B cells in the mice (flight vs. ground controls).  One of our goals is to determine if there is tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.      <P>
2.  An antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) was proposed to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading that occurs during spaceflight (This experiment will be done as part of NNX13AN34G).  In this protocol, mice will be subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice will be immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS, CpG only, tetanus toxoid (TT) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections will be intraperitoneal (i.p.). Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS, we will obtain liver tissue from those mice.  We will directly assess the changes in IgH usage caused by immunization ± adjuvant (CpG) and will address the impact of skeletal unloading. One of our original goals was to examine the impact of spaceflight on host B cell responsiveness in different tissue compartments.  Therefore, this experiment was expected to partially fulfill the goals of Aim 1 of the original grant by using AOS as a spaceflight model.  We proposed to  compare the impact of skeletal unloading using AOS on host responsiveness to antigen challenge and address the issue of tissue specificity in B cell IgH usage.       In addition to the IgH usage studies, we proposed to collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines.  The data obtained from these tissue analyses will be used to assess short- and long-term stress to AOS animals. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Spaceflight offers a unique environment that impacts many physiological systems. This occurs not only in humans but also in rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.  Among these systems, bone and the immune response are connected and are known to be significantly altered by the skeletal unloading of spaceflight.  B lymphocytes are one of the cells that develop in the bone marrow.  They make antibodies in response to infection or immunization with vaccines.  Moreover, the B cells that protect people from disease after receiving immunizations localize to the bone marrow as well as other lymphoid organs.  We will obtain valuable information about what changes occur in the B-cell populations that develop in lymphoid organs such as liver and compare the development of these B-cell populations found in other lymphoid compartments.  This understanding will tell us if more precautions are necessary on Earth when people are skeletally unloaded.  On Earth, skeletal unloading occurs to individuals that are bedridden for long periods of time, wheel-chair bound, or lose the ability to stand for long periods of time.  Therefore, the space environment provides an accelerated view of what will happen to individuals that must endure these prolonged periods of skeletal unloading.   This experiment will have direct relevance to individuals on Earth. <P></td>

						Assessment of the Light Chain Antibody Repertoire in RR1 Validation Flight Liver Tissue    <P>
B cells can facilitate host response to pathogens through cell surface expression and secretion of antibodies. In both mice and humans, B cell development first occurs in the fetal liver and later migrates to the fetal bone marrow where B cell development will continue throughout adulthood. While many studies have assessed the antibody repertoire within the fetal liver, little is known about the B cell population in an adult liver. In order to assess the antibody repertoire, our lab examined the composition of gene segments that are joined together to form a heterodimer of heavy and light chains that make up an antibody. Heavy chains are comprised of one Variable (V), one Diversity (D), one Joining (J) gene segment in addition to a constant region, while light chains lack the diversity region. We characterized the antibody repertoire of adult mouse liver through the use of data and samples collected from the RR1 validation flight.  Rodent Research 1 included two separate mouse studies: NASA (N=7 ground; N=7 flight, 37 days in orbit) and CASIS (N=3 ground; N=3 flight, 21-22 days in orbit).  Illumina HiSeq data (50 bp, 1x) from liver RNA was provided by the NASA GeneLab. Additionally, Illumina MiSeq sequencing was performed on RNA isolated from the liver and spleen of CASIS mice at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility for Illumina MiSeq sequencing (2x, 275-800bp). Illumina sequencing data was imported into CLC Genomics Workbench and quality cleaned. Reads were then mapped to reference variable gene segment sequences obtained from ImMunoGenetics (IMGT) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene database. Fasta files for reads mapping to reference sequences were then submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for junctional analysis. Sequences obtained from HiSeq were not compatible with HighV-Quest due to the short sequence length and as a result only the variable gene segment composition can be assessed within these datasets. HighV-Quest output files from MiSeq sequences were cleaned to remove duplicates resulting from mapping bi-directional sequencing reads and gene segment composition was assessed.     <P>
The composition of V gene segment usage obtained from HiSeq reads was assessed by ground and flight conditions for both ground and flight conditions for both NASA and CASIS cohorts. Differences in gene segment usage were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Briefly, both cohorts exhibited a change in light chain variable gene segment usage, while only the CASIS cohort shown a difference between heavy chain V gene segment usage (abstract submitted for the 2016 ASGSR annual meeting).    <P>
At present, the MiSeq data is available for CASIS flight animals and CASIS ground samples are currently being sequenced.  We have discovered that a significant challenge of assessing the antibody repertoire of liver is the low abundance of sequenced reads mapping to variable gene segments. For example, 1.9% and 2.5% of CASIS flight Illumina MiSeq sequencing reads obtained from the spleen mapped to heavy and light chain references respectively, while both HiSeq and MiSeq reads mapped 0.005-0.1% to reference sequences. Upon IMGT submission and removal of duplicate reads in MiSeq data, just under 200 Kappa light chain V gene segments and less than 30 Lambda chain V gene segments could be identified.     <P>
The impact of spaceflight on the repertoire of antibody light chains can be assessed upon the completion of ground control MiSeq sequencing, adding to HiSeeq data. In addition to the comparison of ground control and flight spleen samples, we will also be able to assess whether the antibody populations vary by tissue using RNA isolated from spleen tissue of the same animals; however, findings may be inconclusive due to the limited population of light chain gene segments identified in the liver. Previously described assessments utilize unimmunized mice; however, our lab will have the opportunity to assess the impact of spaceflight-like conditions in immunized mice using a ground based suspension model. We anticipate completing RR1 comparisons this fall.    <P>
  Assessment of the Heavy Chain Antibody Repertoire in RR1 Validation Flight Liver Tissue    <P>
NASA Mice: The most common V gene segment used among all three groups is V3-01 totally over 50% of the flight repertoire and 40% of the ground repertoire. V1-16 was the next most common with just under 10% of the repertoire for both groups followed by V1-56, which comprised around 5% of the repertoire for both groups. The most common constant region was IgG2b totaling almost 40% of the flight mouse and over 50% of the ground mouse repertoire. IgE comprised 17% and 12% of the repertoire of flight and ground mice respectively, with IgG3 as the next most common at 13% and 11% of the flight and ground animals, respectively.     <P>
CASIS Hi-Seq: The most common V gene segment used was V3-1, with an overall usage around 20% for all groups. The next most common was V1-16 with 11% of the repertoire for the basal group and around 8% for both the flight and ground groups. V1-56 the third most common V gene segment comprising between 7-8% of all groups. IgG2b was the most common constant region with over 40% of the repertoire for the ground control, 50% for the basal control, and almost 60% for the flight group. IgM was the next most highest with 20% of the ground control group, 15% for the basal group, and less than 10 for the flight group. All other isotypes were below 10% for all groups.    <P>
Casis MiSeq: The resequencing of the CASIS animals has yielded very low liver results. While spleens from these same animals using the same techniques are reaching over 20,000 sequences, flight animal 1 had 40 results, flight two had 48, and flight 3 had only 20 productive sequences.  One hypothesis for the low numbers of reads could be because the adult liver does not have many B cells in situ residence or trafficking through in the vasculature.  We have completed sequencing the ground control animals but these have yet to be analyzed.  For flight animals, the most common V gene segment used was V3-6 with 18%, 29%, and 19% of the total repertoire in flight 1, flight 2, and flight 3 respective. V13-2 was the next most common with 8% for flight 1 and 3% for flights 2 and 3. V1-69 was the next most common with 4%, 2%, and 7% of the repertoire. D1-1 was the most common D gene used at around 20% for all animals, however an average of 40% of the D gene segments used were unable to be identified. The J gene segments are fairly balanced in usage among all animals with J2 and J4 being the most common. Due to low read numbers, constant region data are relatively unreliable with as few as two constant regions identified for some animals. IgM was the most common with 65% to 100% of constant regions identified. The average CDR3 length is between 11 and 12 amino acids and no CDR3 overlap was detected among the three groups.  We anticipate completing the ground analyses in the next couple of months to complete comparisons between flight and ground mice and assessing the differences/similarities among MiSeq and HiSeq data.      <P>
  Antiorthostatic Suspension Study    <P>
The AOS was done to skeletally unload mice to simulate the skeletal unloading and stress that occurs during space flight (Experiment 1 took place in March 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]; Experiment 2 took place in May 2016 [5 mice per treatment group]). In this protocol, female, 8-week-old mice were subjected to AOS.  Two weeks later the mice were immunized in 1 of 4 ways; PBS (buffer control), CpG only (adjuvant), tetanus toxoid (TT; antigen) only, and TT with CpG.  Injections were done by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Two weeks after immunization and continued AOS (28 day total unloading), we obtained both spleen and liver tissue from those mice.  This protocol was followed so that when mice are flown to ISS in the future, we will have the AOS as a comparison group with parallel variables.      <P>
Liver samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA was purified using Trizol and isopropanol precipitation methods.  We have obtained 80 liver samples from these mice and over 80% of the RNA samples have RINS = 8.0.  Sequencing and data analyses will proceed during the next project period.  We will assess the changes in IgV (heavy and light chain) usage caused by immunization ± adjuvant (CpG) and will address the impact of skeletal unloading.      <P>
Impact of immunization and antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) on stress markers.      <P>
Preliminary analysis of the stress marker, corticosterone, suggest that while there was an impact of unloading on circulating corticosterone, there was no impact of TT or CpG.   We also assessed thymus mass on the AOS mice to assess long-term stress on the mice.  We do see a significant decrease in mass due to HLU, which is consistent with the corticosterone response. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The Aims of this project will be to collect mouse liver, bone marrow, thymus, and adrenal glands (as part of the kidney). Our group is interested in the impact of spaceflight on the B cell response to tetanus toxoid antigen immunization. Although we will have access to blood and spleen tissues for analyses on the SX6/ISS (SpaceX 6/International Space Station) mission ( <a target="_blank" href="https://taskbook.nasaprs.com/Publication/index.cfm?action=public_query_taskbook_content&TASKID=9351">https://taskbook.nasaprs.com/Publication/index.cfm?action=public_query_taskbook_content&TASKID=9351</a>  ), NASA did not provide access to bone, kidney/adrenals, and thymus tissue, although we requested them as secondary science in the original application. Therefore, this tissue-sharing opportunity will allow us to obtain those tissues to provide additional data and strengthen the primary scientific mission. Thymus and adrenals will be used for the assessment of stress on the animals. In addition, spaceflight also impacts lymphocyte responses in an organ-specific manner. Therefore, we propose to collect liver and bone marrow to make comparative analyses of IgH gene usage to the already planned spleen analysis.    <P>
These tissues will be used to accomplish the following two specific aims:    <P>
1. Specific Aim 1: Collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines. These tissues will be used to assess short- and long-term stress to the flight animals.    <P>
2. Specific Aim 2: Collect liver and bone marrow. These tissues will be used for the preparation of RNA to allow for a comparative analysis of B cell IgH usage between lymphoid compartments.    <P>
This project will be done by a multi-disciplinary team of experts. Dr. Chapes is an infectious disease immunologist (Kansas State University) who has almost 100 publications, including results from multiple space shuttle missions, spaceflight, and immunology. Drs. Pecaut and Gridley (Loma Linda University) are both well-published in the spaceflight- and radiation-immunology fields with over 50 and 150 peer reviewed publications, respectively. Similarly, We have worked together for more than 10 years, establishing a strong working relationship. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Spaceflight offers a unique environment that impacts many physiological systems. This occurs not only in humans but also in rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.  Among these systems, bone and the immune response are connected and are known to be significantly altered by the skeletal unloading of spaceflight.  B lymphocytes are one of the cells that develop in the bone marrow.  They make antibodies in response to infection or immunization with vaccines.  Moreover, the B cells that protect people from disease after receiving immunizations localize to the bone marrow as well as other lymphoid organs.  We will obtain valuable information about what changes occur in the B-cell populations that develop in lymphoid organs such as liver and compare the development of these B-cell populations found in other lymphoid compartments.  This understanding will tell us if more precautions are necessary on Earth when people are skeletally unloaded.  On Earth, skeletal unloading occurs to individuals that are bedridden for long periods of time, wheel-chair bound, or lose the ability to stand for long periods of time.  Therefore, the space environment provides an accelerated view of what will happen to individuals that must endure these prolonged periods of skeletal unloading.   This experiment will have direct relevance to individuals on Earth. <P></td>

						1.  We learned that NASA would freeze these tissues in space in partially dissected carcasses.  Therefore, we assessed various methods to recover tissues from frozen carcasses.  Bone marrow, liver, thymus, and kidneys were the focus of these validation studies.    <P>
2.  Carcasses were frozen by NASA using ISS protocols and shipped to KSU (Kansas State University).  We optimized our dissection techniques and assessed the RNA quality from liver and bone marrow from these NASA samples.  A protocol for obtaining high-quality RNA from liver was validated.  High quality bone marrow RNA was not obtainable from any of the methods we assessed.  Thymus was able to be thawed and weighed for size assessment (as a measure of stress).  Kidneys could be obtained and refrozen for future analyses. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The Aims of this project will be to collect mouse liver, bone marrow, thymus, and adrenal glands (as part of the kidney). Our group is interested in the impact of space flight on the B cell response to tetanus toxoid antigen immunization. Although we will have access to blood and spleen tissues for analyses on the SX6/ISS mission ( <a target="_blank" href="https://taskbook.nasaprs.com/Publication/index.cfm?action=public_query_taskbook_content&TASKID=9351">https://taskbook.nasaprs.com/Publication/index.cfm?action=public_query_taskbook_content&TASKID=9351</a>  ), NASA did not provide access to bone, kidney/adrenals, and thymus tissue, although we requested them as secondary science in the original application. Therefore, this tissue-sharing opportunity will allow us to obtain those tissues to provide additional data and strengthen the primary scientific mission. Thymus and adrenals will be used for the assessment of stress on the animals. In addition, space flight also impacts lymphocyte responses in an organ-specific manner. Therefore, we propose to collect liver and bone marrow to make comparative analyses of IgH gene usage to the already planned spleen analysis.    <P>
These tissues will be used to accomplish the following two specific aims:    <P>
1. Specific Aim 1: Collect thymus to weigh the tissue to compare relative thymic atrophy among treatment groups and adrenal glands to assess catecholamines. These tissues will be used to assess short- and long-term stress to the flight animals.    <P>
2. Specific Aim 2: Collect liver and bone marrow. These tissues will be used for the preparation of RNA to allow for a comparative analysis of B cell IgH usage between lymphoid compartments.    <P>
This project will be done by a multi-disciplinary team of experts. Dr. Chapes is an infectious disease immunologist (Kansas State University) who has almost 100 publications, including results from multiple space shuttle missions, spaceflight and immunology. Drs. Pecaut and Gridley (Loma Linda University) are both well-published in the spaceflight- and radiation-immunology fields with over 50 and 150 peer reviewed publications, respectively. Similarly, We have worked together for more than 10 years, establishing a strong working relationship. <P></td>
