                    <td colspan="3"> Beneficial microbes play a significant role in the normal development of animal tissues. Through the formation of healthy stable associations between host and symbiont, particularly during post-embryonic development, carefully regulated developmental pathways can be induced.    <P>
In this experimental research plan, we propose to examine the impact of microgravity on the normal molecular interactions between host and symbiont. To examine these effects we propose to use the model system between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. For over two decades this squid-vibrio model has served as an ideal ecosystem to examine the influences of mutualistic bacteria on animal development. To simulate microgravity, rotating bioreactors called high-aspect-ratio rotating wall vessel bioreactors (HARVs) will be used to provide a low-shear environment for both the host and symbiont, thereby simulating microgravity. Specifically, we propose the following:    <P>
Objective 1. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.    <P>
Objective 2. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria exposure under microgravity conditions.    <P>
Objective 3. Develop a flight-ready microtiter plate for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis in this new hardware.    <P>
The proposed work has several implications for the field of space biology. First, by examining how normal healthy symbioses are initiated and maintained under microgravity conditions, we can begin to determine the sensitivity of these ecosystems to perturbations in the space environment. Secondly, we can assess the genetic and metabolic responses to gravity in the presence and absence of symbiosis, potentially identifying previously unknown triggers or cues associated with post-embryonic animal development. <P></td>

						A. Project Overview – This project examined the impact of microgravity on commensal, non-pathogenic microbes that associate with animal tissues. To address this issue we conducted an integrative study in which the responses of both animal host and microbe were examined in situ under simulated microgravity conditions. The long-term goal of the research was to assess whether those interactions between animal cells and mutualistic bacteria undergo a significant alteration in cell-cell communication, immune response, and physiology under microgravity conditions. The overall objective of this proposal was to examine the genomic expression patterns of a host symbiotic squid Euprymna scolopes in response to the luminescent bacterial symbiont, Vibrio fischeri. The results of this study helped identify those genetic pathways that are differentially regulated in the host animal in the presence and absence of mutualistic bacteria under simulated microgravity conditions, thereby improving our understanding of human health in the space environment.     <P>
B. Major Findings and Outcomes of Research    <P>
1. The symbiotic V. fischeri appear to modulate the host innate immune and oxidative stress response of the host light organ during modeled microgravity conditions. Using RNA-seq we analyzed the transcriptome of the host light organ (i.e., the site of symbiosis) of the squid in the presence (symbiotic) and absence (aposymbiotic) of beneficial V. fischeri under simulated microgravity conditions. At 12 h post inoculation both the symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with hemocyanin, oxidative stress, and the innate immune system. However, by 24 h post inoculation only the aposymbiotic animals exhibited an upregulated stress response, whereas those animals exposed to V. fischeri no longer showed the stress response suggesting that V. fischeri is helping to modulate the host response. Results were published in Casaburi et al., 2017 – See cumulative bibliography for citation; reported in FY2018 report.    <P>
2. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shedding by V. fischeri is increased under simulated microgravity conditions. Under modeled microgravity conditions V. fischeri releases a statistically higher amount of the virulence factor LPS, known to cause apoptosis and inflammation in both mutualistic and pathogenic microbes. The LPS production is primarily associated with flagellar movement and by knocking out flagellar production and motion the amount of LPS produced under both microgravity and gravity conditions was reduced. However, even with the removal of the flagella, the LPS shedding was still statistically higher in modeled microgravity conditions compared to gravity conditions. We have ascertained that under modeled microgravity the V. fischeri membrane integrity is compromised and is more susceptible to antibiotic treatment. We are examining whether we can further inhibit the differential shedding of LPS under modeled microgravity conditions.    <P>
3. Sequencing and closure of the Euprymna scolopes genome revealed two evolutionary mechanisms for symbiotic organ evolution.  Using the RNA-seq data generated during this project we generated a reference transcriptome for the host animal and use that as a scaffold to close the genome of E. scolopes. Although this task was not originally part of our project goals the data was invaluable in providing a closed genome for the squid-vibrio research community. Analysis of the genome and reference transcriptome revealed that there are two distinctive evolutionary processes associated with the origin of symbiotic organs in animals. A manuscript is currently in press at PNAS.    <P>
4. Modeled microgravity alters the innate immune pathway of host squid. Using the new technique NanoString, we complemented the previously generated transcriptomes by analyzing the differential gene expression along additional time points (0, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24 h) and have generated a new model of the receptor and signal cascade of the innate immune system. We have also determined that modeled microgravity impacts the expression of the innate immune genes and we have identified key parts of the pathway that are being disrupted. (Publication in preparation.)    <P>
5. Modeled microgravity does not significantly alter the transcriptome of the symbiont V. fischeri; however, the global regulatory gene hfq is critical to regulate the bacterial stress responses in low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). The transcriptome of the bacterial symbiont was examined during both exponential and stationary phase growth and results indicated that modeled microgravity had no significant impact on gene expression at 12 and 24 h. However, when the global regulator gene hfq was deleted from the bacteria, there was a pronounced change in gene expression under LSMMG conditions. There was a dramatic increase in the number of transcripts associated with TCA cycling and stress responses suggesting that the Hfq protein serves as a critical regulator for the bacteria under modeled microgravity conditions.

                    <td colspan="3"> Beneficial microbes play a significant role in the normal development of animal tissues. Through the formation of healthy stable associations between host and symbiont, particularly during post-embryonic development, carefully regulated developmental pathways can be induced.    <P>
In this experimental research plan, we propose to examine the impact of microgravity on the normal molecular interactions between host and symbiont. To examine these effects we propose to use the model system between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. For over two decades this squid-vibrio model has served as an ideal ecosystem to examine the influences of mutualistic bacteria on animal development. To simulate microgravity, rotating bioreactors called high-aspect-ratio rotating wall vessel bioreactors (HARVs) will be used to provide a low-shear environment for both the host and symbiont, thereby simulating microgravity. Specifically, we propose the following:    <P>
Objective 1. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.    <P>
Objective 2. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria exposure under microgravity conditions.    <P>
Objective 3. Develop a flight-ready microtiter plate for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis in this new hardware.    <P>
The proposed work has several implications for the field of space biology. First, by examining how normal healthy symbioses are initiated and maintained under microgravity conditions, we can begin to determine the sensitivity of these ecosystems to perturbations in the space environment. Secondly, we can assess the genetic and metabolic responses to gravity in the presence and absence of symbiosis, potentially identifying previously unknown triggers or cues associated with post-embryonic animal development. <P></td>

4. Research Progress:    <P>
Task 1. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria under microgravity conditions.    <P>
RNAseq - Generating transcriptomic libraries to animal host. We completed this task in 2016 and published the first paper on the transcriptome in 2017. However, the transcriptomes under gravity and microgravity conditions have served as a rich resource to begin to look at the molecular mechanisms associated the effects of microgravity on a beneficial symbiosis.    <P>
A. New peptidoglycan receptor identified in host animal -- Data mining of the host transcriptome has identified a novel peptidoglycan receptor (PRPG) that responds to V. fischeri peptidoglycan, a key molecule for the activation of the host immune system. Although there was a statistically significant increase in the expression of the PRPG in symbiotic animals compared to animals without bacteria, there wasn’t a difference between gravity and microgravity conditions at 12 and 24 h. We are in the process of examining earlier time points to assess whether there is differential expression under microgravity conditions.    <P>
B. Genome assembly of host Euprymna scolopes – In addition to the microgravity studies, the results of this project are being used to generate an assembled transcriptome of the host organism Euprymna scolopes. The transcriptome was assembled earlier this year and has now served as a scaffold to assemble the E. scolopes genome. The genome is now 96% complete, which is the highest for any mollusk, and we are in the process of completing the bioinformatic analyses and preparing this work for publication. Additionally, once the paper has been submitted we will generate an online portal for researchers to access the data and compare the results to the E. scolopes database.     <P>
Task 2. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.    <P>
Bacterial transcriptomes under simulated microgravity and gravity conditions – This aspect of the project was completed in 2016. However, the results provided some interesting insight into the onset of the apoptotic cell death.    <P>
A. LPS shedding by V. fischeri is accelerated under simulated microgravity conditions. Our analyses have revealed that under microgravity conditions there is an increase in the shedding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the surface of V. fischeri. LPS is a virulence factor known to induce the immune systems of animals. We are currently characterizing this shedding by studying the production of outer membrane vesicles (OMV) formed due to flagellar activity of the microbes. We are in the process of ascertaining wither the LPS is associated with the OMV by examining several mutants of V. fischeri that have no or hyperflagellar activity during microgravity conditions.     <P>
B. Elucidating the apoptosis cascade within the bacteria-induced development of the host. Based on the results obtained in Task 1, we are now examining the potential bacterial-induced apoptosis cascade in the host animal and how this might be linked to the immune response. Through bioinformatic data mining and PCR we have not identified the presence of numerous apoptosis genes and are in the process of trying to ascertain if they are differentially expressed under simulated microgravity.    <P>
Task 3. Delineate the flight hardware for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis during flight.    <P>
Techshot Fluid Processing Cassette – We have been working with Dave Reed of Techshot to assess the viability of the host organisms in the Techshot Fluid Processing Cassette (FPC) hardware. We assessed the biocompatibility of the Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bags and the Pharmed BPT tubing as well as the population loading of the bags and found the animals can survive with no additional nutrients or feeding for a total of five days. We are currently working on engineering solution to bring in new seawater and potential nutrients to extend this to a minimum of two weeks. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Beneficial microbes play a significant role in the normal development of animal tissues. Through the formation of healthy stable associations between host and symbiont, particularly during post-embryonic development, carefully regulated developmental pathways can be induced.    <P>
In this experimental research plan, we propose to examine the impact of microgravity on the normal molecular interactions between host and symbiont. To examine these effects we propose to use the model system between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. For over two decades this squid-vibrio model has served as an ideal ecosystem to examine the influences of mutualistic bacteria on animal development. To simulate microgravity, rotating bioreactors called high-aspect-ratio rotating wall vessel bioreactors (HARVs) will be used to provide a low-shear environment for both the host and symbiont, thereby simulating microgravity. Specifically, we propose the following:    <P>
Objective 1. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.    <P>
Objective 2. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria exposure under microgravity conditions.    <P>
Objective 3. Develop a flight-ready microtiter plate for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis in this new hardware.    <P>
The proposed work has several implications for the field of space biology. First, by examining how normal healthy symbioses are initiated and maintained under microgravity conditions, we can begin to determine the sensitivity of these ecosystems to perturbations in the space environment. Secondly, we can assess the genetic and metabolic responses to gravity in the presence and absence of symbiosis, potentially identifying previously unknown triggers or cues associated with post-embryonic animal development. <P></td>

						Task 1. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria under microgravity conditions.    <P>
RNAseq - Generating transcriptomic libraries. We exposed host animals, in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria, to modeled microgravity conditions and generated transcriptomic libraries to each treatment (with gravity controls). Total RNA was extracted from the light organs (i.e., the site of symbiosis) and cDNA libraries were generated in triplicate. A total of 24 cDNA libraries were sequenced using the NextSeq500 generating over 100 GB of sequencing data. The libraries were generated and sequenced in YR2; however, the analysis of the data was completed in YR3. In YR 2 an analysis pipeline was developed to annotated and compare the sequenced derived from the RNAseq analysis as described in the previous report. In YR3 we have completed the analyses of the data and have identified the following effects associated with microgravity and host-microbe interactions:     <P>
1. Microbes appear to regulate host immune response in squid-vibrio association in modeled microgravity. Although the RNAseq analysis revealed several hundred significantly differentiated genes associated with modeled microgravity, there was a pronounced increase in the number of innate immune system related genes associated with aposymbiotic animals (i.e., animals that did not have their symbiotic bacteria) exposed to microgravity. These results suggest that microbes might be playing an important regulating the immune system of their host organisms during microgravity conditions.    <P>
	In addition to genes associated with the innate immune system there were also differentially regulated genes associated with oxidative stress (e.g., SOD1, superoxide dismutase), light organ remodeling and development (e.g., PCDHGB 6, 2, protocadherins; chymotryposins). A manuscript describing a full overview of the differentially expressed genes in the presence of microgravity is being submitted to Nature Microgravity in the next month.    <P>
 2. Transcriptome assembly of host Euprymna scolopes – In addition to the microgravity studies, the results of this project are being used to generate an assembled transcriptome of the host organism Euprymna scolopes. The genome of E. scolopes is not currently available and the assembled transcriptome will help all researchers working on this model organism to improve their annotation and understanding of the host organisms. We are in the process of generating an online portal for researchers to access the data and compare the results to the E. scolopes database. In YR3 we used a state-of-the-art sequencing platform called PacBio Isoseq to expand our transcriptome data base and improve the quality and coverage of the host E. scolopes transcriptome. We generated 83,000 unique isoforms (i.e., genes) and are working in collaboration with the E. scolopes community genome project to help them improve the assembly of the squid genome.      <P>
Task 2. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.    <P>
A. Analysis of symbiont transcriptome in the presence and absence of the RNA-binding protein Hfq: Cultures of wild-type Vibrio fischeri and a mutant strain of V. fischeri defective in the gene hfq were exposed to simulated microgravity conditions using a High-aspect ratio bioreactor chambers. The gene hfq was targeted as previous research on known pathogens have identified this gene as a global regulator that is significantly down-regulated during simulated microgravity and actual space flight conditions. In YR2, total RNA was isolated from each treatment and then processed to remove ribosomal RNA. We then generated cDNA libraries to the remaining message RNA and then sequenced the libraries using a NextSeq Illumina platform. There were eight individual treatments and libraries were generated in triplicate for the treatments for a total of 24 cDNA libraries. In YR3 we have identified the expression of several Microbe-Associated Molecular Pattern (MAMPs) molecules such as lipopolysaccharide synthesis genes that appear to be upregulated in the absence of Hfq.     <P>
B. Screening of V. fischeri mutant library to determine which genes are essential for microgravity and if they activate the host immune response. In addition to analyzing the V. fischeri transcriptome we have screened a transposon mutant library for any genes that may be essential for V. fischeri to live in microgravity conditions.     <P>
 Although not part of the original project, we had the opportunity to work with Dr. Mark Mandel of Northwestern University, who generated the library and we used the HARV reactor systems purchased through this Space Biology award. Essentially insertion sequencing was used to identify putative microgravity essential genes in V. fischeri. Transposon mutagenesis was performed in V. fischeri and this “input library” was then passaged under microgravity conditions twice. These libraries will be sequenced to identify which of the genes were critical for growing in a microgravity environment.     <P>
Task 3. Delineate the flight hardware for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis during flight.    <P>
Techshot Fluid Processing Cassette – Over the past three years I have met with numerous flight hardware companies about whether their hardware would be optimal for flying the squid-vibrio symbiosis. To conduct a flight experiment we need three compartments in which we can add animal hosts, the bacterial symbiont, and either RNAlater or a glutaraldehyde fixative. Based on these requirements I have narrowed down the best option for this system as the Techshot Fluid Processing Cassette (FPC). I have worked with Dave Reed of Techshot regarding the FPC and we have assessed the biocompatibility of the Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) bags and the Pharmed BPT tubing as well as the population loading of the bags. Currently, the FPC system seems to be the most ideal hardware for replicating many of these ground experiments in high quality microgravity conditions.     <P>
During our no cost extension we plan to continue these experiments to optimize the number of host animal replicates within the FEP bags as well as how long the animals can be maintained within the hardware. <P>

						Task 1. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria under microgravity conditions.    <P>
A.  RNAseq - Generating transcriptomic libraries. We exposed host animals, in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria, to modeled microgravity conditions and generated transcriptomic libraries to each treatment (with gravity controls). Total RNA was extracted from the light organs (i.e., the site of symbiosis) and cDNA libraries were generated in triplicate. A total of 24 cDNA libraries were sequenced using the NextSeq500 generating over 100 GB of sequencing data. The data is currently under analysis as described in the next section.    <P>
B. Bioinformatic analysis. A new pipeline was developed to annotate and compare the sequenced derived from the RNAseq analysis. The recovered sequences were assembled using the de novo assembly program Trinity and annotated using Trinotate. The quality of the assemblies was evaluated using Detonate and the abundance of the different reads were estimated using Bowtie/RSEM. The results were statistically compared using the differential expression analysis program EdgeR.     <P>
1. Modeled microgravity-specific changes in host animal. RNAseq analysis revealed several hundred significantly differentiated genes associated with modeled microgravity.  A direct comparison of the different genes expressed in the symbiotic and aposymbiotic (i.e., without bacteria) was conducted.  Results show numerous genes that are differentially regulated in both apo and symbiotic conditions, such as superoxide dismutase and the respiratory protein hemocyanin.    <P>
2. Transcriptome assembly of host Euprymna scolopes – In addition to the microgravity studies, the results of this project are being used to generate an assembled transcriptome of the host organism Euprymna scolopes. The genome of E. scolopes is not currently available and the assembled transcriptome will help all researchers working on this model organism to improve their annotation and understanding of the host organisms. We are in the process of generating an online portal for researchers to access the data and compare the results to the E. scolopes database.     <P>
The analyses of the data derived from Task 1 has led to the development of an R package that visualizes the interactions of these various data sets. We are in the process of preparing the package for publication.    <P>
Task 2. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity    <P>
A) Generation of the symbiont transcriptome: Cultures of wild-type Vibrio fischeri and a mutant strain of V. fischeri defective in the gene hfq were exposed to simulated microgravity conditions using High-aspect ratio bioreactor chambers. The gene hfq was targeted as previous research on known pathogens has identified this gene as a global regulator that is significantly down-regulated during simulated microgravity and actual space flight conditions. Total RNA was isolated from each treatment and then processed to remove ribosomal RNA. We then generated cDNA libraries to the remaining message RNA and then sequenced the libraries using a NexSeq Illumina platform. There were eight individual treatments and libraries were generated in triplicate for the treatments for a total of 24 cDNA libraries.    <P>
B) Bioinformatic analysis.  We have received the sequences and are now completing the bioinformatic analysis and comparison of the libraries to assess which genes were differentially expressed in the symbiotic bacteria under simulated microgravity conditions. We have assessed the impact microgravity had on gene expression on mutants defective in the global regulator hfq. Importance of this task: This work will provide a key base of target genes to explore in greater detail to potentially identify candidates genes that may be altering the host immune responses. For example we will be looking for the expression of various Microbe-Associated Molecular Pattern (MAMPs) molecules such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan.    <P>
Task 3. Delineate the flight hardware for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis during flight.   Work associated with Task 3 will be the focus of YR3. Efforts using different styles of hardware (e.g., NanoRacks microtiter plate, BioServe Fluid Mixing Apparatus) will be used to assess the required condition needed to keep the host animals and bacteria alive during flight operations. <P>

						Task 1. Develop a flight-ready microtiter plate for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis in this new hardware.    <P>
A prototype has been constructed to house six replicate juvenile squid that includes both activation and deactivation chambers. The prototype hardware is estimated to be available by October 1, 2014 for testing with the animals to ensure its effectiveness.    <P>
Task 2. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria under microgravity conditions.    <P>
We have divided this task into two primary projects: A) examine the symbiont transcriptome in the presence or absence of gravity; and B) examine the host transcriptome. In YR1 we have completed the first component.     <P>
A) Examining the symbiont transcriptome: Cultures of wild-type Vibrio fischeri and a an hfq defective mutant V. fischeri were exposed to simulated microgravity conditions using High-aspect ratio bioreactor chambers. The gene hfq was targeted as previous research on known pathogens has identified this gene as a global regulator that is significantly down-regulated during simulated microgravity and actual space flight conditions.    <P>
Total RNA was isolated from each treatment and then processed to remove ribosomal RNA. We then generated cDNA libraries to the remaining message RNA and then sequenced the libraries using a NexSeq Illumina platform. There were eight individual treatments and libraries were generated in triplicate for the treatments for a total of 24 cDNA libraries. We have received the sequences and are now completing the bioinformatic analysis and comparison of the libraries to assess which genes were differentially expressed in the symbiotic bacteria under simulated microgravity conditions. We will also assess the impact microgravity had on gene expression on mutants defective in the global regulator hfq. We anticipate differences will be present in the relative abundance of virulence genes.   Importance of this task: this work will provide a key base of target genes to explore in greater detail and potentially generate mutants to assess if there is a microgravity phenotype associated with V. fischeri.    <P>
B) Examining the host transcriptome: A postdoc was hired in July 2014 to begin this task. We have begun the exposure of host animals in the presence and absence of the bacteria and started to accumulate enough tissue for RNA extraction. We are also in the process of optimizing the RNA extraction protocol for the host tissue. Currently, we can extract 1 microgram of total RNA from 10 juvenile light organs (i.e., the site of symbiosis in the host squid). We are trying to improve on this so that we can reach the same concentration with three animals as that the prototype flight hardware will only house six animals per plate.    <P>
Task 3. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity.    <P>
Work on this task is just beginning as a new graduate student was been assigned to this research objective in July of 2014 and is completing her coursework. This task will be a primary focus of YR2.   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Beneficial microbes play a significant role in the normal development of animal tissues. Through the formation of healthy stable associations between host and symbiont, particularly during post-embryonic development, carefully regulated developmental pathways can be induced.     <P>
In this experimental research plan, we propose to examine the impact of microgravity on the normal molecular interactions between host and symbiont. To examine these effects we propose to use the model system between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. For over two decades this squid-vibrio model has served as an ideal ecosystem to examine the influences of mutualistic bacteria on animal development. To simulate microgravity, rotating bioreactors called high-aspect-ratio rotating wall vessel bioreactors (HARVs) will be used to provide a low-shear environment for both the host and symbiont, thereby simulating microgravity. Specifically, we propose the following:    <P>
Objective 1. Examine the mechanism(s) associated with the delay of bacteria-induced immune cell trafficking that occurs in simulated microgravity    <P>
Objective 2. Characterize the changes in the transcriptome of the host squid in the presence and absence of symbiotic bacteria exposure under microgravity conditions.    <P>
Objective 3. Develop a flight-ready microtiter plate for future flight experiments and optimize the conditions needed to initiate and maintain the symbiosis in this new hardware.    <P>
The proposed work has several implications for the field of space biology. First, by examining how normal healthy symbioses are initiated and maintained under microgravity conditions, we can begin to determine the sensitivity of these ecosystems to perturbations in the space environment. Secondly, we can assess the genetic and metabolic responses to gravity in the presence and absence of symbiosis, potentially identifying previously unknown triggers or cues associated with post-embryonic animal development. <P></td>
