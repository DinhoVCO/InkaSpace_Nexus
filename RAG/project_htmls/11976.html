            <td colspan="3"> September 2023 report: Key personnel on the original grant application are unchanged. This includes co-Principal Investigator (PI) Cheryl Nickerson and her team Jennifer Barrila (co-I) and Jiseon Yang (originally a postdoc, now Research Assistant Professor) at Arizona State University (ASU), as well as C Mark Ott (co-I) at NASA Johnson Space Center (NASA-JSC). Two additional participants, Sandhya Gangaraju and Richard Davis at Arizona State University (ASU) are also participating. Due to the expertise of our team, we performed all the necessary microscopy and will not require external collaborators as originally considered. In the PI’s lab at Texas State (TxST), Starla Thornhill was a master's degree student as the grant was being written. She successfully defended her MS thesis in 2016 and completed her PhD in 2020 on work directly related to this grant. She continued as a postdoc during 2021 and along with Sandhya Gangaraju and Jiseon Yang (from ASU), completed all the postflight microscopy. As well, we have added Alistair McLean as an unpaid collaborator. He works as a software engineer and wrote a program that helps us enumerate bacterial populations from microscopy images. Finally, as a result of discussions during the flight readiness review, we have been asked to consult with metallurgical experts from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA-MSFC) to assist our team in interpreting microbial corrosion information. We agree to this request as it will greatly enhance the science and benefits to NASA and our team. The specific metallurgical expert(s) are being identified by S. Gorti at NASA-MSFC.<br/></td></tr>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bacteria and other microorganisms have been shown to grow as surface-adherent biofilm communities in the microgravity environment during spaceflight. Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. As a result of supplemental funding, we are now able to gather genetic data on the mechanisms by which mixed bacterial species are able to form biofilms in microgravity conditions. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth. <P></td>

The third sample returned with Crew-1 on May 2, 2021. We encountered two major issues that have led us to request a reflight (which has been approved). One issue was media contamination, rendering our data interpretation as inconclusive. A second issue (needlestick injury to a space crewmember) resulted in some of our samples incubating for 117 days on the International Space Station (ISS) rather than the planned 4 days. While that caused a potential loss of some transcriptome data (described in the Task Progress section), a really positive development from the extended incubation resulted in enhanced microbial corrosion data, as well as the return of viable microorganisms that can now be investigated for genetic changes as a consequence of prolonged spaceflight. We are now pursuing an active study of experimental evolution in collaboration with the microbiology lab at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) (Co-I Mark Ott, Sarah Wallace, and their team). Another major positive development is the initiative to develop a machine learning computational approach to identify microbial-induced corrosion (MIC). MIC represents an estimated annual global economic loss of $500B and detection is a key need. We anticipate that our analytical approach in this area will have major economic benefits, far beyond the space program. Once our reflight occurs, we will be able to complete all of our original objectives easily within a year of getting our samples. <P></td>

						Our overall objectives for this proposal are to study surface-adherent bacterial growth (biofilm formation) on stainless steel materials used for the water recovery system on the International Space Station, with a mixed bacterial population and its potential contributions to stainless steel corrosion during spaceflight, and compare these effects to those seen on Earth-based studies (ground controls). Included in these studies were tests to investigate the role of a potential silver-based disinfectant in controlling biofilm formation and associated corrosion. At the outset, we proposed to study biofilms using light and electron microscopy during spaceflight as well as with identical experiments on Earth (ground controls). We have since expanded these techniques, and more importantly, the rigor of the microscopy investigations by developing a computer analysis approach for quantitative analysis of the light microscopy results.    <P>
During the current year (2022-2023), we began the process of developing an artificial intelligence-based approach to measure microbial corrosion using electron microscopy. We also obtained approval from NASA to include analysis of genetic activity (officially termed transcriptome analysis) so that we would be able to determine the activities of the microorganisms during spaceflight and ground experiments in the presence and absence of silver disinfectants. Our initial flight experiment launched on SpaceX CRS-21 in December 2020, and most of our samples were returned in mid-January 2021. A later set of samples, containing living bacteria, returned in May 2021. Just prior to the December 2020 launch, we learned that one of the commercially-supplied ingredients of our bacterial growth media was contaminated, so while we obtained results from the initial experiments, we were unable to determine whether any effects were due to the spaceflight conditions or due to the contamination. As a result, we have been approved for a reflight, which is currently scheduled for March 2024. The goal of the reflight will be to conduct and analyze our original experiments related to biofilm growth, potential control by silver disinfection, and its role in microbial corrosion of stainless steel. One unexpected positive opportunity arose from our delayed sample (returned in May 2021) as we were able to culture living bacteria, that had been incubated in orbit for 117 days. We also have ground control bacteria that incubated for the same duration, and with the assistance of the microbiology team at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), we are able to sequence these organisms, as well as the original “ancestral bacteria” (cultures preserved prior to experimentation) and see whether spaceflight induces any unique mutations in these organisms, a scientific approach referred to as experimental evolution. These two studies (experimental evolution and developing artificial intelligence to diagnose microbial corrosion) have been our most active areas of research during the 2022-23 period.    <P>
In summary, while the original contamination event and reflight scheduling has been quite challenging, we have obtained some unexpected bonus science in computer-aided image analysis of biofilms and corrosion, as well as an unexpected and highly meaningful opportunity to investigate whether spaceflight affects bacterial evolution. With a future successful reflight, we anticipate a highly successful scientific outcome. <P>

            <td colspan="3"> October 2021 report: Key personnel on the original grant application are unchanged. This includes co-Principal Investigator (PI) Cheryl Nickerson and her team Jennifer Barrila (co-I) and Jiseon Yang (originally a postdoc, now Research Assistant Professor) at Arizona State University (ASU), as well as C Mark Ott (co-I) at NASA Johnson Space Center (NASA-JSC). Two additional participants, Sandhya Gangaraju and Richard Davis at Arizona State University (ASU) are also participating. Due to the expertise of our team, we performed all the necessary microscopy and will not require external collaborators as originally considered. In the PI’s lab at Texas State (TxST), Starla Thornhill was a master's degree student as the grant was being written. She successfully defended her MS thesis in 2016 and completed her PhD in 2020 on work directly related to this grant. She continued as a postdoc during 2021 and along with Sandhya Gangaraju and Jiseon Yang (from ASU), completed all the postflight microscopy. As well, we have added Alistair McLean as an unpaid collaborator. He works as a software engineer and wrote a program that helps us enumerate bacterial populations from microscopy images. Finally, as a result of discussions during the flight readiness review, we have been asked to consult with metallurgical experts from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA-MSFC) to assist our team in interpreting microbial corrosion information. We agree to this request as it will greatly enhance the science and benefits to NASA and our team. The specific metallurgical expert(s) are being identified by S. Gorti at NASA-MSFC.<br/></td></tr>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bacteria and other microorganisms have been shown to grow as surface-adherent biofilm communities in the microgravity environment during spaceflight. Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. As a result of supplemental funding, we are now able to gather genetic data on the mechanisms by which mixed bacterial species are able to form biofilms in microgravity conditions. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth. <P></td>

The third sample returned with Crew-1 on May 2, 2021. We encountered two major issues that have led us to request a reflight (that decision is currently pending). One issue was media contamination, rendering our data interpretation as inconclusive. A second issue (needlestick injury to a space crewmember) resulted in some of our samples incubating for 117 days on the International Space Station (ISS) rather than the planned 4 days. While that caused a potential loss of some transcriptome data (described in the Task Progress section), a really positive development from the extended incubation resulted in enhanced microbial corrosion data, as well as the return of viable microorganisms that can now be investigated for genetic changes as a consequence of prolonged spaceflight. While data analysis will continue, our preliminary results suggest that corrosion might be enhanced during spaceflight. <P></td>

						Our flight experiment was authorized in June 2020 and our experiment, entitled “Bacterial Adhesion and Corrosion” (BAC) launched to the ISS on Space X-21 (CRS-21) on 12/6/2020. Our objectives were to: examine and compare mixed culture bacterial biofilm growth on Earth and during spaceflight; investigate susceptibility of biofilms to a proposed silver-based disinfectant; measure corrosion due to biofilm growth; and measure gene expression that would indicate bacterial responses to the various growth conditions (microgravity on the ISS, full gravity on Earth, and the presence or absence of silver disinfectant). Experimental materials for spaceflight and ground control studies were prepared at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) prior to launch. The ground control experiments were conducted using the same protocols as were done in space. Our original plan was to sample three time points (4 days, 14 days, and 24 days). All three samples were incubated on the ISS as scheduled, but due to crew time limitations only two of the samples (14-day and 24-day) were processed and returned with CRS-21 on 1/14/2021. The third sample (originally planned for a 4-day incubation) returned with the Crew-1 payload on 5/2/2021 (total incubation 117-days).    <P>
After the experiment was loaded onto the rocket and just prior to launch, we were informed that one component of our growth media components (an amino acid solution) had failed the manufacturer’s sterility test. When we analyzed our ground control samples and compared those to previous samples incubated under identical conditions, there were significant differences. Further testing with media prepared with the contaminated amino acid showed a different bacterial growth profile when compared to bacterial growth in uncontaminated media. Analysis of biofilm colonization images from all three time points (14-day and 24-day, returned on CRX-21; and 117-day, returned on Crew-1) showed no significant difference between spaceflight and ground control samples in the absence of silver disinfection. However, differences were observed between spaceflight and ground control biofilm samples grown in the presence of silver disinfectant. However, given the presence of an unknown media contaminate we cannot attribute whether the biofilm images seen are due to spaceflight or attributable to media contamination.    <P>
The unexpected change in our third sample (originally planned for 4-days, returned after 117-days) resulted in some changes to our available data. While we did not get the initial high yield of RNA (anticipated with a 4-day culture), our cultures were returned without fixation and as a result a number of viable organisms were obtained. These cultures will represent a unique opportunity to investigate the role of long-term culture (i.e., 117-days) on microgravity-grown, when compared to ground-controls (i.e., grown in full gravity). We also have the original ancestral bacteria available and plan on sequencing these organisms in the near future to take advantage of this unique opportunity. Examination of microbial corrosion of the stainless steel used in our experiments showed enhanced results that would not have been available in shorter-term trials. Statistical analysis of the corrosion data is ongoing and initial impressions (subject to validation) imply an enhancement of corrosion in microgravity.    <P>
In summary, while we obtained some very interesting results, the media contamination is a real concern, so we are unable to accurately interpret the data from the Bacterial Adhesion and Corrosion (BAC) mission. Nevertheless, our unexpected long-term (117-day) sample provides some unexpected positive benefits with enhanced corrosion results and also the return of viable long-term spaceflight grown cultures that can be sequenced to identify genetic changes that might occur due to spaceflight. As stated earlier, we have requested a reflight due to the media contamination concerns (and have adopted contingency plans to avoid this). In the event that a reflight is not approved, we will request a no-cost extension so that we can complete our genetic (transcriptome) analysis, since those funds were just released. <P>

This includes co-Principal Investigator (PI) Cheryl Nickerson and her team (Jennifer Barrila (co-I) and Jiseon Yang (originally a postdoc, now Research Assistant Professor) at Arizona State University, as well as C Mark Ott (NASA-Johnson Space Center-JSC). Two additional participants, Sandhya Gangaraju and Richard Davis at Arizona State University are also participating. Due to the expertise of our team, we are able to do all the necessary microscopy and will not require external collaborators as originally considered. Starla Thornhill was a masters' student as the grant was being written. She successfully defended her MS thesis in 2016 and is now doing her PhD on work directly related to this grant. I had one MS student, Quentin DiPasquale (now graduated), who did modeled microgravity work that is peripheral to the NASA-funded project. With Quentin's graduation, I have another new MS student, Calvin Tran along with a newly recruited undergraduate, Ashtin Hardin, who are continuing the microgravity work to see if aquatic organisms preferentially grow in simulated microgravity. As well, we have added Alistair McLean as an unpaid collaborator. He works as a software engineer and wrote a program that helps us enumerate bacterial populations from microscopy images. Finally, as a result of discussions during the flight readiness review, we have been asked to consult with metallurgical experts from Marshall Space Flight Center to assist our team in interpreting microbial corrosion information. We agree to this request as it will greatly enhance the science and benefits to NASA and our team. The specific metallurgical expert(s) are being identified by S. Gorti at NASA-MSFC.<br/></td></tr>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bacteria and other microorganisms have been shown to grow as surface-adherent biofilm communities in the microgravity environment during spaceflight. Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. As a result of supplemental funding, we are now able to gather genetic data on the mechanisms by which mixed bacterial species are able to form biofilms in microgravity conditions. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> In work accomplished to date, we have successfully shown that mixtures of different bacteria can grow and form aggregates on surfaces and in liquid (bacterial biofilms), when grown under conditions that mimic the water recycling equipment on the ISS. Our experiments involved using the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). As well, we inserted genes that code for fluorescent proteins into each of these organisms so that we can identify and distinguish them using a microscope as E. coli will fluoresce red and P. aeruginosa will fluoresce green. We developed a software program that can be used to count and analyze differently stained bacteria in microscopy images. This program is intended to be freely available to the scientific community.    <P>
The two experimental organisms, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, are often found in wastewater recycling systems and our future work will let us determine whether they need to grow together in a microgravity environment, and does one organism protect another if a disinfectant is used. That protection appears to occur in several microbial fouling environments on Earth and one benefit of the proposed work will be to investigate how reduced gravity affects bacterial protection against a proposed silver-based disinfectant. Through additional funding, we are now able to do genetic analysis of the two bacteria under microgravity conditions and so gain insight as to the mechanisms by which they are able to form biofilms and the effect of the disinfectant on these mechanisms, in comparison to full-gravity control experiments done on Earth.    <P>
We have also completed tests and observed that biofilm growth by the E. coli and P. aeruginosa microorganisms can cause some slight corrosion of stainless steel. We have completed all the ground-based investigations including the experimental verification tests (EVT), and have passed flight readiness review. We now await our flight experiment (and associated ground controls), tentatively planned for Space X21. Due to launch delays, our project has been extended an extra year, during which time we will be doing all post flight analysis of our flight samples and associated ground controls. <P></td>

						The microbiology culturing protocols in preparation for the flight experiment and accompanying ground control studies have been completed. These include protocols for media preparation and determination of stability; the preparation and delivery of the bacterial test strains and ensuring their viability; the protocols and selection of time points to be used for experimental activation during flight; the longevity of the experiments during flight; and the preservation and stability of the samples following flight experiments. Silver-based disinfection is also planned and the parameters associated with the preparation, stability, and effectiveness of the disinfection was also performed. In prior years, we determined that the microscopy examination of surface-adherent bacteria (biofilms) would need to be performed post-flight (i.e., once the samples had been returned to Earth), and a considerable amount of effort was done during years 3 and 4 to refine and optimize these tasks. Although not anticipated, we also developed a backup protocol to enhance the fluorescent signals from bacteria within surface-adherent (biofilm) populations, using an antibody-based treatment. This backup protocol is intended for use in the event there would be a considerable delay in the return of samples to the investigators. Two other microscopy stains that enable us to detect specific organic matrix components of biofilms have also been incorporated. Finally, we also incorporated and refined a newly-developed computer program (micro counter) to obtain numerical data related to our microscopy images.  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques on our samples were also refined during year four. SEM enables higher resolution imaging of bacterial surface colonization (low vacuum-SEM) or detailed high-resolution studies of corrosion (high vacuum-SEM) and accompanying elemental analysis (energy dispersive X-ray analysis) to identify specific changes in iron, nickel, and chromium (primary components of stainless steel).    <P>
We also obtained supplemental funding to perform measurements of gene expression (transcriptome analysis) of biofilm samples from flight and ground-control studies. This data would be intended for use in future investigations by ourselves and other research groups. The protocols were developed and verified.    <P>
The major final accomplishment during year four was the performance of the Experimental Verification Test (EVT) to confirm that our protocols worked. Following successful completion of EVT, we passed a flight readiness review and are now cleared to launch our experiment. Logistical details for flight preparation are being conducted involving our research team, Bioserve (University of Colorado), and appropriate NASA personnel, including personnel at Kennedy Space Center. <P>

This includes co-Principal Investigator (PI) Cheryl Nickerson and her team (Jennifer Barrila and Jiseon Yang) at Arizona State University, as well as C Mark Ott (NASA-Johnson Space Center-JSC). Two additional participants, Sandhya Gangaraju and Richard Davis at Arizona State University are also participating. Due to the expertise of our team, we are able to do all the necessary microscopy and will not require external collaborators as originally considered. Starla Thornhill was a masters' student as the grant was being written. She successfully defended her MS thesis in 2016 and is now doing her PhD on work directly related to this grant. I had one MS student, Quentin DiPasquale (now graduated), who did modeled microgravity work that is peripheral to the NASA-funded project. With Quentin's graduation, I have another new MS student, Calvin Tran, who is continuing the microgravity work to see if aquatic organisms preferentially grow in simulated microgravity. As well, we have added Alistair McLean as an unpaid collaborator. He works as a software engineer and is writing a program that will help us enumerate bacterial populations from microscopy images.<br/></td></tr>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bacteria and other microorganisms have been shown to grow as surface-adherent biofilm communities in the microgravity environment during spaceflight. Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. As a result of supplemental funding, we are now able to gather genetic data on the mechanisms by which mixed bacterial species are able to form biofilms in microgravity conditions. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> In work accomplished to date, we have successfully shown that mixtures of different bacteria can grow and form aggregates on surfaces and in liquid (bacterial biofilms), when grown under conditions that mimic the water recycling equipment on the ISS. Our experiments involved using the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). As well, we have just inserted genes that code for fluorescent proteins into each of these organisms so that we can identify and distinguish them using a microscope as E. coli will fluoresce red and P. aeruginosa will fluoresce green. We are also developing a software program that can be used to count and analyze differently stained bacteria in microscopy images. This program is intended to be freely available to the scientific community.    <P>
These two organisms, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, are often found in wastewater recycling systems and our future work will let us determine whether they need to grow together in a microgravity environment, and does one organism protect another if a disinfectant is used. That protection appears to occur in several microbial fouling environments on Earth and one benefit of the proposed work will be to investigate how reduced gravity affects bacterial protection against a proposed silver-based disinfectant. Through additional funding, we are now able to do genetic analysis of the two bacteria under microgravity conditions and so gain insight as to the mechanisms by which they are able to form biofilms and the effect of the disinfectant on these mechanisms, in comparison to full-gravity control experiments done on Earth.    <P>
We have also completed some tests and observed that biofilm growth by the E. coli and P. aeruginosa microorganisms can cause some slight corrosion of stainless steel. In planned experiments during the coming year, we will investigate if gravity or reduced gravity has an influence on this process. <P></td>

						In the first year of the grant, we purchased necessary equipment for conducting simulated weightlessness (modeled microgravity) experiments in the lab. We tested a number of bacterial strains to identify two representative bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). While the P. aeruginosa strain PAO-1 had been grown successfully in several ground-based modeled microgravity and flight-based studies, the E. coli strains (originally associated with urinary tract infections) had never been studied, although there is at least one incident (Apollo 13) in which an astronaut had a urinary infection, so the choice of an organism with that infection potential is quite relevant. From 12 candidate E. coli strains, we selected one, E. coli strain F11, which had originally been isolated from a patient with a first episode of a bladder infection. The criteria for selection was the ability of these two strains to grow in a modified artificial urine medium (mAUM) under modeled microgravity (MMG) at ambient temperature (25C), which mimics conditions on the ISS. Based on the ability of these bacteria to grow as biofilms in mAUM in modeled microgravity, we selected our bacterial strains (P. aeruginosa PA01 and E. coli F11). The P. aeruginosa strain contained the gene for the green fluorescent protein (gfp) and we inserted a gene for a red-fluorescing protein (mCherry) into the E. coli F11 strain so that these two bacteria could be distinguished by microscopy as green- and red-fluorescing cells.    <P>
During year two, we progressed towards getting flight readiness. Much of our experimental work has been done in concert with Bioserve at the University of Colorado, who are doing the hardware (Biocell) preparation that will be used for flight experiments. Variations in flight hardware were tested with the key issues being biological reproducibility and the ability of the specimens to be analyzed by confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy is designed to acquire a three-dimensional image of biological structures and the individual bacteria could be identified on the basis of the green- and red-fluorescing proteins. We also obtained different stains that could identify surface materials (slime) produced by the two bacteria. When we first started the project, we had planned on using microscopy facilities available on the ISS. However, we learned that the ISS confocal microscope would not be able to illuminate one of the key fluorescent proteins (gfp) and so had to adjust our planning and experimentation to preserve the bacteria upon completion of the experiment during flight, and then doing all microscopy after the completion of the flight.    <P>
During year three (current report), we finalized the flight hardware design, and identified the three time points for data collection. Initial difficulties with the stainless steel component of the flight hardware were fixed with the help of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA-MSFC). We were fortunate to get some modest additional support that now enables us to do genetic analysis of our samples and identify mechanisms by which bacteria are able to form mixed-species biofilms in microgravity in the presence and absence of a disinfectant. We were able to finalize the experimental conditions and identify some restrictions (such as stability of the media and microorganisms prior to experimentation, and the stability of the fluorescent signal and genetic material (RNA) following experimentation)). One notable success is our microscopy. We are now able to do all the necessary microscopy (both confocal microscopy and electron microscopy). At the conclusion of year three, we were in a position to do an overall evaluation of the entire procedure (called an Experimental Verification Test (EVT)) using materials and equipment intended for use by the space crew.    <P>
Ongoing work for year four:    <P>
EVT planning and experimentation (now completed); Establishing a timeline for experimentation (now completed); Training of additional team members for microscopy (in progress); Flight experiment (our experiment has been delayed until likely Space X-21) and planning is in progress for that as well as post-flight microscopy and genetic analysis, and overall data analysis. <P>

Two collaborators at JSC (Mayra Nelman and Simon Clemett) will be involved primarily on post-flight analysis.  Starla Thornhill was a masters' student as the grant was being written. She successfully defended her MS thesis in 2016 and is now doing her PhD on work directly related to this grant. I have one new MS student, Quentin DiPasquale, who is doing modeled microgravity work that is peripheral to the NASA-funded project. As well, we have added Alistair McLean as an unpaid collaborator. He works as a software engineer and is writing a program that will help us enumerate bacterial populations from microscopy images.<br/></td></tr>

Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth. <P></td>

Our experiments involved using the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). As well, we have just inserted genes that code for fluorescent proteins into each of these organisms so that we can identify and distinguish them using a microscope as E. coli will fluoresce red and P. aeruginosa will fluoresce green. We are also developing a software program that can be used to count and analyze differently stained bacteria in microscopy images. This program is intended to be freely available to the scientific community.    <P>
These two organisms, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, are often found in water recycling systems and our future work will let us determine whether they need to grow together in a microgravity environment, does one organism protect another if a disinfectant is used. That protection appears to occur in several microbial fouling environments on Earth and one benefit of the proposed work will be to investigate how reduced gravity affects bacterial protection against disinfectants.     <P>
In future planned work, we will also be doing some tests to see whether the E. coli and P. aeruginosa microorganisms may cause corrosion of stainless steel and if gravity or reduced gravity has an influence on this process. <P></td>

						In the first year of the grant, we purchased necessary equipment for conducting simulated weightlessness (modeled microgravity) experiments in the lab. In our investigations the plan was to use two representative bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). While the P. aeruginosa strain PAO-1 had been grown successfully in several ground-based modeled microgravity and even flight-based studies, the E. coli strains (originally associated with urinary tract infections) had never been studied, although there is at least one incident (Apollo 13) in which an astronaut had a urinary infection, so the choice of an organism with that infection potential is quite relevant. To this end, we obtained 12 E. coli strains that had been associated with a variety of urinary tract infections from three labs with extensive background in urinary infection research; the University of Michigan ((Principal Investigator (PI) – HLT Mobley)), Baylor College of Medicine (PI – R Hull), and the University of Montreal (PI – J Harel) in Canada. These strains were evaluated for potential growth in a modified artificial urine medium (mAUM) under modeled microgravity (MMG) at ambient temperature (25C), which mimics conditions on the ISS. Based on the ability of these bacteria to grow as biofilms in mAUM in modeled microgravity, we selected our bacterial strains (P. aeruginosa PA01 and E. coli F11). The P. aeruginosa strain contained the gene for the green fluorescent protein (gfp) and we inserted a gene for a red-fluorescing protein (mCherry) into the E. coli F11 strain so that these two bacteria could be distinguished by microscopy as green- and red-fluorescing cells.    <P>
For year two, we are progressing towards getting flight readiness. Much of our experimental work is being done in concert with Bioserve at the University of Colorado, who is doing the hardware (Biocell) preparation that will be used for flight experiments.    <P>
	Objectives and achievements during the second year of the grant were:     <P>
1.	Finalized media formulation – Fluids list has been forwarded to Bioserve    <P>
2.	Finalized Biocell design and cleaning / sterilization protocol – Shared with Bioserve    <P>
3.	We can get biofilms growing reproducibly on stainless steel in Biocells    <P>
4.	We can image biofilms, although due to limitations of excitation wavelength of LMM (light microscopy module) microscope, will do all imaging post-flight – Explained below    <P>
5.	Fluorescent image improved with post-flight processing (adding anti-gfp antibodies) – TBD influence of this processing on structure    <P>
6.	Worked out ratio of bacteria (Ec-Pa) to send as frozen inoculum – TBD stability of frozen inoculum, which would be relevant with mission scrubs.    <P>
Work in progress:    <P>
7.	Stability of fixed biofilm samples in different fixative (paraformaldehyde (PFA)) concentrations    <P>
8.	Effective concentrations of Ag for biofilm control    <P>
9.	Selection of sample time points.    <P>
Details of progress:    <P>
	The media formulation and culture conditions allow us to reproducibly grow biofilms on the Biocell flight hardware devices (objectives 1-4). The Biocells have 12 wells which include a stainless steel coupon, mounted on a pedestal and the chambers are covered with teflon. Two issues that were resolved were: A) the preparation and cleaning of the stainless steel, and B) the final design of the Biocells including the 2 mm distance between the stainless steel coupon and the teflon membrane. Repeated tests have shown that reproducible biofilms are grown in this device (objectives 2 and 3).    <P>
For imaging (objective 4), our fluorescent molecules Gfp and mCherry require excitation spectra of 395 nm and 587 nm, respectively. The current laser for confocal microscopy on the ISS light microscopy module (LMM) has a 532 nm wavelength, which would weakly image the mCherry molecule on E. coli F11 but would not detect the Gfp molecule on P. aeruginosa PA01. Confocal microscopy is necessary to remove background light during biofilm imaging as we do get biofilm growth on both the teflon membrane as well as the stainless steel coupons. As a result, we will not use the LMM on the ISS but rather conduct all microscopy post-flight.     <P>
Work in progress (near completion):    <P>
We are optimizing protocols to enhance signals using post-flight treatments with fluorescently-tagged antibodies to the reporter molecules Gfp and mCherry (objective 5). As well, we are confirming the protocol to send cultures to launch so as to accommodate potential launch scrubs and associated delays (objective 6). As well, we are testing the stability of biofilms in varying lengths of fixation and concentrations of paraformaldehyde (PFA) (objective 7). Culture and biofilm stability will also be an essential aspect of selecting the time points (objective 9) for imaging during flight. <P>

Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth. <P></td>

Our experiments involved using the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). As well, we have just inserted genes that code for fluorescent proteins into each of these organisms so that we can identify and distinguish them using a microscope as E. coli will fluoresce red and P. aeruginosa will fluoresce green.     <P>
These two organisms are often found in water recycling systems and our future work will let us determine whether they need to grow together in a microgravity environment, does one organism protect another if a disinfectant is used. That protection appears to occur in several microbial fouling environments on Earth and one benefit of the proposed work will be to investigate how reduced gravity affects bacterial protection against disinfectants.     <P>
In future planned work, we will also be doing some tests to see whether the E. coli and P. aeruginosa microorganisms may cause corrosion of stainless steel and if gravity or reduced gravity has an influence on this process. <P></td>

						In the first year of the grant, we purchased necessary equipment for conducting simulated weightlessness (modeled microgravity) experiments in the lab. In our investigations the plan was to use two representative bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). While the P. aeruginosa strain had been grown successfully in several ground-based modeled microgravity and even flight-based studies, the E. coli strains (originally associated with urinary tract infections) had never been studied, although there is at least one incident (Apollo 13) in which an astronaut had a urinary infection, so the choice of an organism with that infection potential is quite relevant. To this end, we obtained 12 E. coli strains that had been associated with a variety of urinary tract infections from three labs with extensive background in urinary infection research--the University of Michigan (PI HLT Mobley), Baylor College of Medicine (PI R Hull), and the University of Montreal in Canada (PI J Harel).    <P>
Our overall objective for the first year of the grant was to investigate: 1) whether our representative bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) could grow under modeled microgravity by themselves or when mixed together, 2) select the strain of E. coli that would be the best suited for modeled microgravity, 3) introduce a gene into the two organisms that would allow them to be identified and distinguished with a microscope, and 4) see whether we get biofilm formation on stainless steel under modeled microgravity conditions.    <P>
We have met all four year-one objectives.      <P>
Objective 1: All of our bacterial strains tested will grow in both normal gravity (1-g) and MMG conditions. In co-culture, E. coli strain F11 (associated with bladder infections) grew the best both in pure culture and when mixed with P. aeruginosa.    <P>
Using a lab-based bioreactor, we are able to get our organisms growing in modeled microgravity. P. aeruginosa by itself or when mixed with individual E. coli strains would form suspended biofilms.    <P>
Objectives 2 and 3: We introduced a gene causing red fluorescence into each strain of E. coli. Of the various E. coli strains tested, strain F11, provided the best results. This strain was also subjected to being frozen and thawed (to mimic conditions that would likely occur prior to the organisms being sent into orbit). Strain F11 showed the best survival-- the fluorescent gene was stable and barring any unforeseen circumstances will be the strain used in our flight experiments.    <P>
Objective 4: Demonstration of biofilm formation on steel under modeled microgravity. These experiments are currently in progress. So far we have identified a strategy for keeping small stainless steel objects suspended in our bioreactors under modeled microgravity conditions. As well, we have been able to image and differentiate the two bacterial species (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) adherent to the stainless steel spheres in modeled microgravity.     <P>
We are currently at a point where we will need the flight hardware to begin that phase of testing. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Bacteria and other microorganisms have been shown to grow as surface-adherent biofilm communities in the microgravity environment during spaceflight. Organisms within biofilms are quite resistant to traditional antimicrobial chemicals and can foul water treatment filters resulting in potential risk to the astronauts. The biofilms on International Space Station (ISS) consist of many species, yet studies to date have only tested single-species biofilms. There is growing evidence that mixed-culture biofilms behave quite differently from pure culture biofilms, and we anticipate this phenomenon to occur in the microgravity environment of ISS. Through this study we will investigate the structure by which two-species, mixed-culture biofilms form under microgravity on stainless steel used to construct Environmental Controls and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) on the ISS. As well, we will explore the efficacy by which mixed-culture biofilms can be controlled, and whether microgravity-grown mixed-culture biofilms cause corrosion on stainless steel. Our results are designed to both enable future spaceflight missions and translate into information for the general scientific community on Earth. <P></td>
