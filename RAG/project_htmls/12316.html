            <td colspan="3"> Final report August 2021: The COVID-19 pandemic continued to hinder progress on this grant. Pandemic-imposed travel restrictions at the Noble Research Institute prevented us from traveling to the Microgravity Simulation Support Facility (MSSF) to complete several  experiments proposed in specific aims 1 and 3. In addition to the problems brought about by COVID-19, the Noble Research Institute leadership discontinued its programs on plant science, plant breeding and laboratory-based science research. A fallout from this decision was the termination of all external grants that were not aligned with the new focus of the Institute on regenerative ranching. This NASA grant was one of several federal grants at the Noble Research Institute that were asked to be discontinued. Furthermore, the PI (Blancaflor) and Co-I (Nakashima) ended their employment at the Noble Research Institute in March and May, respectively, as a result of the decision to terminate basic plant science research. Therefore, on March 2021, a request was made to NASA to transfer remaining work on this grant to Dr. Simon Gilroy at the University of Wisconsin. 
Once the grant is transferred to Wisconsin, a no cost extension (NCE) will be requested so that remaining tasks in aims 1 and 3 could be completed. PI change: Dr. Simon Gilroy  will be the new PI at Wisconsin). Other key personnel change Dr. Sabrina Chin (former postdoctoral fellow at Noble who will continue as a postdoc in the Gilroy lab at Wisconsin).<br/></td></tr>

                    <td colspan="3"> Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent "omics" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal aims to gain a better mechanistic understanding of how plant roots function at the cellular and molecular levels. A primary focus of the proposed work is to ask how the microgravity environment modulates the directionality of root growth. Because roots are essential for the uptake of water and nutrients, knowledge gained from successful implementation of the proposed work will be crucial in guiding pre-breeding efforts aimed toward the development of crops with improved productivity through better and more efficient root systems. Thus, agriculture on Earth is one beneficial outcome of this project.    <P>
Innovative technologies developed through this grant include lines of new model plants such as barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) and purple false brome (Brachypodium distachyon) expressing genetically-encoded sensors to the cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic calcium.

						Although progress was made on all 3 specific aims of this proposal, it was limited because of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and closure of the PI's laboratory at the Noble Research Institute. Below we summarize progress for each aim.    <P>
For aim 1, most of our progress was made on processing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings for immunocytochemistry. Because we were not able to travel to the Microgravity Simulation Support Facility (MSSF) at the Kennedy Space Center in 2020, we focused our work activities in this aim using a custom-made 2D clinostat. Four-day old seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the light and dark were mounted on the clinostat, and rotated in an axial direction for 2-weeks. Corresponding 1-g controls were included in the experiment. A 2-week clinorotation regimen was selected to approximately mirror the period of time seedlings in our previous Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) BRIC-16 and Advanced Plant Experiments (APEX) APEX-03-1 experiments were exposed to microgravity on the space shuttle and International Space Station (ISS), respectively. Each treatment condition had four 10 cm x 10 cm square Petri dishes. After 2 weeks of growth, at least 5 seedlings for each condition (i.e., clinorotated and 1-g controls) were preserved in an aldehyde solution and processed for flat embedded in LR White resin. The remaining seedlings were kept in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Because of the closure of the PI’s lab at Noble, embedded and PBS-stored samples were shipped to the laboratory of Dr. Simon Gilroy (University of Wisconsin). Future studies in the Gilroy lab upon transfer of the grant will involve sectioning the embedded seedlings and subsequent immunocytochemistry of selected non-cellulosic cell wall components.    <P>
For specific aim 2, we have  successfully generated lines of Brachypodium distachyon (a model grass) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged microtubule and actin reporters. We expect that these live cell cytoskeletal reporters in a model grass species will advanced studies of grass cell biology. Through past and current NASA support, we have now generated plant lines in Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Brachypodium distachyon expressing live cell microtubule and actin reporters. All these lines have been sent to the Gilroy lab in Wisconsin for use in future studies of microgravity- and clinorotated-induced changes in the cytoskeleton.     <P>
Most of our progress for aim 3 has been on characterizing  actin cytoskeletal-related mutants that we isolated from previous NASA-funded research (APEX 03-1). Two peer-reviewed articles relevant to this aim were published during this reporting period. One noteworthy accomplishment during this reporting period was completing detailed cell biological studies on the recessive Arabidopsis thaliana hypersensitive to LatB2 (hlb2) mutant. Through map-based cloning, we found that the mutation in hlb2 had a 10 base pair deletion in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene.  AT1G03060 encodes a protein called SPIRRIG (SPI), a 3,571 amino acid long protein with N-terminally located armadillo (ARM) and concanavalin A (ConA)-like lectin domains and C-terminally-located pleckstrin homology (PH), beige and Chediak Higashi (BEACH) and WD40 repeat domains. BEACH domain-containing proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are known to function in membrane dynamics, vesicle transport, apoptosis and receptor signaling.     <P>
In a recent paper published in The Plant Cell, we studied root hair development in the hlb2/spi mutant. Root hairs are tip growing cells (i.e., cell expansion is confined to the apical-most domain of the cell) that extend the effective radius of a root to enable plants to optimize water and nutrient absorption. In previous spaceflight studies, we found that root hair development is impaired in microgravity. Root hair development is a complex process that involves the actin cytoskeleton and a multitude of proteins that specify the position of root hair emergence, and drive tip-focused growth. To gain an in-depth understanding of the role of actin during root hair development, it is important to be able to visualize the dynamics of proteins that may directly or indirectly modulate actin organization during this process. Visualizing protein dynamics in living cells is typically accomplished by tagging with a fluorescent protein such as GFP. However, some proteins that modulate root hair development are large and of low abundance, and therefore more challenging to analyze when tagged with fluorescent proteins. SPI is one such protein as it is 3,571 amino acids long. In the absence of SPI, root hair tip growth and the position of root hair emergence is stunted suggesting that this protein is a major modulator of root hair development.     <P>
In the aforementioned Plant Cell publication, we generated a fully functional fluorescent protein for SPI using a technique called recombineering in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. Expressing the SPI protein fusion in the hlb2/spi mutant drove normal root hair development and localized to the tip-most domain of rapidly elongating root hairs. The root hair tip localization of SPI was correlated with tip-focused filamentous-actin (F-actin) meshwork . Our work also revealed a link between SPI and selected components of the actin nucleating promoting complex WAVE/SCAR (W/SCR). For example, a fully functional BRICK1 (BRK1) fluorescent protein fusion (BRK1-mRuby3), a subunit of W/SCR, marked the position of root hair emergence. Live cell microscopy of BRK1-YFP and SPI-YPet revealed contrasting spatial and temporal dynamics, with the former intensifying and the latter dissipating as root hairs elongated. To observe BRK1 and SPI simultaneously within the same root hair, we generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and BRK1-mRuby3. BRK1-mRuby3 labeled the site in which a new root hair emerged and dissipated as the root hair bulge expanded. Within the same root hair cell, SPI-YPet fluorescence at the tip intensified as BRK1-mRuby3 dissipated. The weakening of BRK1-mRuby3 fluorescence coinciding with SPI-YPet accumulation provides indirect evidence that SPI might play a role in mediating BRK1 stability or localized clustering at the plasma membrane at the position of root hair emergence. Although it is unknown why BRK1-YFP signal persists in spi, we speculate that SPI might modulate BRK1 via protein degradation pathways .Our work on HLB2/SPI provides new insights that contribute to our understanding of actin-mediated root hair development, and point to potential functional relationships among HLB2/SPI and actin nucleation proteins during root hair development. For the future, we plan to evaluate genetic interactions between SPI and components of actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3)-W/SCR complex.     <P>
The live cell actin reporters we generated through NASA funding has also resulted in productive research collaborations with external Institutions. One noteworthy collaboration that made extensive use of our live cell actin reporters was with the group of Dr. Yangdou Wei at the University of Saskachewan, Canada. Using Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing the GFP-ABD2-GFP live cell actin reporter,  new details on how plants defend themselves against the powdery mildew fungal pathogen was discovered. It was shown that one of the earliest responses of plants to powdery mildew was the formation of actin patches beneath the fungal invasion sites. The assembly of this actin patch is facilitated by the ARP2/3-W/SCR complex and another actin nucleating protein called formin.    <P>
NOTE: The PI (Blancaflor) and Co-I (Nakashima) ended their employment at the Noble Research Institute in March and May, respectively, as a result of the Noble decision to terminate basic plant science research. Therefore, on March 2021, a request was made to NASA to transfer remaining work on this grant to Dr. Simon Gilroy at the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Gilroy will be new PI for this work. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent "omics" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth. <P></td>

A primary focus of the proposed work is to ask how the microgravity environment modulates the directionality of root growth. Because roots are essential for the uptake of water and nutrients, knowledge gained from successful implementation of the proposed work will be crucial in guiding pre-breeding efforts aimed toward the development of crops with improved productivity through better and more efficient root systems. Thus, agriculture on Earth is one beneficial outcome of this project.    <P>
Innovative technologies developed through this grant include lines of new model plants such as barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) and purple false brome (Brachypodium distachyon) expressing genetically-encoded sensors to the cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic calcium.

						For this reporting period, we made significant progress with all three aims. An important milestone during this reporting period is the completion of aim 2. For this aim, we used a microgravity simulator called a clinostat to test the hypothesis that a natural plant compound called brassinolide regulates the direction of root growth through its effects on a cellular structure called the cytoskeleton (or cell skeleton). The two major components of the cytoskeleton are microtubules and microfilaments. The latter component is made up of a protein called actin; actins are proteins also found in muscle and nerve cells. From previous NASA-funded research, it has often been hypothesized that actin is major regulator of gravitropism (i.e., the process of shoots growing up and roots growing down).  However, results from this aim, which we published this year, suggest that the role of actin has to do more with regulating autotropism or the straightening of plant organs after completing gravitropism.    <P>
Our task progress during this reporting period also included the use of the Airbus Random Positioning Machine (RPM) and the Space Bio-Laboratories GRAVITE 3-D Clinostat at the Microgravity Simulation Support Facility (MSSF) located at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). We used the RPM and 3-D clinostat to determine if changes in the composition, abundance, and distribution of cell wall components of plant roots were affected by simulated microgravity (aim 1).  The cell wall of plants consists of a carbohydrate-rich network and some proteins embedded within this network. The cell wall is largely responsible for giving plants their rigidity, which allows their shoots to grow upright or roots to penetrate the soil. Our experiments at the MSSF have revealed that simulated microgravity can indeed modify certain cell wall properties in roots. However, the type of changes can differ depending on the type of microgravity simulator used. We also compared cell wall changes triggered by simulated microgravity versus those induced by spaceflight. The latter results were obtained from past NASA spaceflight projects. We found that the RPM mirrored more closely cell wall modifications induced by spaceflight. Plans are underway to repeat microgravity simulator experiments at the MSSL for at least two more times.    <P>
For this reporting period, we also made significant progress with aim 3. For this aim, we evaluated root growth orientation in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, that was disrupted in genes involved in actin function (i.e., actin mutants). Consistent with our results from aim 2, we found that actin mutants would reorient their root growth on a 2-D clinostat more strongly when compared to plants without any actin genes missing. These results further reinforce our conclusions from aim 2 that the actin cytoskeleton is a major regulator of plant autotropism.     <P>
Experiments that we conducted in aim 3 also identified a new component of the cell that participates in maintaining the integrity of actin networks. This protein called SPIRRIG is enriched in parts of the cell where actin- and cell wall-dependent growth is most active, most notably the tips of root hair cells. A peer-reviewed paper that reports on the characterization of this protein is in preparation.    <P>
Finally, we have introduced to the scientific community two Medicago truncatula (a model plant legume) lines that contain fluorescent reporters so their actin cytoskeleton can be studied in real time. These new F-actin reporter lines in M. truncatula could potentially be used to address a number of biological questions in legumes, particularly processes that do not occur in other model plants such as Arabidopsis. With regard to NASA relevance, a future gravitational biology-related study in which these new M. truncatula lines would be of value is the dynamic monitoring of F-actin in various tissues of graviresponding roots or with future light microscopy modules housed on the International Space Station (ISS). <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent "omics" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth. <P></td>

A primary focus of the proposed work is to ask how the microgravity environment modulates the directionality of root growth. Because roots are essential for the uptake of water and nutrients, knowledge gained from successful implementation of the proposed work will be crucial in guiding pre-breeding efforts aimed toward the development of crops with improved productivity through better and more efficient root systems. Thus, agriculture on Earth is one beneficial outcome of this project.    <P>
Potential innovative technologies developed through this grant include lines of new model plants such as barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) and purple false brome (Brachypodium distachyon) expressing genetically-encoded sensors to the cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic calcium. We expect that these new plant lines will significantly advance basic plant biology research on Earth. <P></td>

Specific Aim 1. Immunocytochemistry of selected cell wall components in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on a slowly-rotating clinostat and random positioning machine (RPM).        <P>
Specific Aim 2. Characterize autonomic root straightening in maize roots in response to brassinolide (BL) - and latrunculin B (LatB) - induced actin disruption.     <P>
  Specific Aim 3. Evaluate root growth of selected Arabidopsis actin single and double mutants, and peroxidase mutants on microgravity simulators.    <P>
Progress to date has been made mostly for aims 2 and 3. The experiments outlined in aim 2 have been completed. A peer-reviewed manuscript about the completed work in aim 2 will be submitted on July 31, 2019. Briefly, the experiments in aim 2 made use of a custom made 2-D clinostat to better understand how the actin cytoskeleton contributes to directional root growth. To address this question, we employed a combination of pharmacology and microscopic imaging of the filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton in roots of maize (Zea mays) and Barrel Medic (Medicago truncatula). From previous NASA-funded research, we found that disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton in roots using actin antagonists such as latrunculin B (LatB) caused roots to exhibit enhanced responses to gravity. Such effects were even more dramatic when plants were grown on a 2-D clinostat. Interestingly, the plant hormone brassinolide had roughly similar effects on root gravitropism as LatB, leading us to hypothesize that both compounds have similar effects on F-actin organization and dynamics. We found that brassinolide treatment modified both F-actin organization and global dynamics but such effects were not as dramatic as those observed for LatB-treated roots. High nanomolar (500 nM) to low micromolar concentrations (5 uM) brassinolide were needed to elicit quantifiable effects on F-actin organization in both chemically-fixed and living roots. For LatB, low nanomolar (25-100 nM) was sufficient to trigger both qualitative and quantitative effects on the root F-actin networks and root gravitropism. Taken together, our results from specific aim 2 indicate that brassinolide- and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explain by inhibited autotropic root straightening response, and that brassinolide affects this process by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.     <P>
We have also made substantial progress for the work outlined in aim 3. Most of our progress for aim 3 has been on the successful cloning of Arabidopsis thaliana root mutants identified via forward genetic screens. Mutants of particular interest are those that exhibited differential sensitivity to the actin-disrupting compound mentioned above (i.e., LatB). We are pleased to report that we have successfully cloned the disrupted genes in the hypersensitive to LatB 2 and 3 mutants (hlb2 and hlb3). Both are recessive mutants like our published hlb1 mutant from previous NASA-funded research. Like the HLB1 gene, HLB2 and HLB3 are proteins that link F-actin with the membrane system of plants. We plan to characterize root growth of hlb1, hlb2, and hlb3 mutants in more detail on the clinostat and random positioning machine (RPM) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC)-Microgravity Simulation Support Laboratory (MSSL). Another exciting development regarding this aim is our successful cloning of the causal gene in one mutant that is resistant to LatB (i.e., LatB resistant – LBR1). Unlike the hlb mutants, Lbr1 is dominant and contains a mutation in the ACTIN7 gene. As implied from its name Lbr1 roots are able to grow despite the presence of high nanomolar concentrations of LatB. The ability of Lbr1 to grow on concentrations of LatB that severely inhibit wild type plants is consistent with observations that the actin cytoskeleton of Lbr1 remains intact even in the presence of LatB. We believe that the mutation in the Lbr1 mutant is affecting the ability of LatB to bind monomeric forms of actin, which subsequently makes LatB less toxic. Like the hlb mutants, we plan to evaluate root growth of Lbr1 on a 2-D clinostat and RPM. We hypothesize that like mutants to actin itself, some of these other mutants would exhibit enhanced or dampened root growth directional or skewing responses on microgravity simulators. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent "omics" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth. <P></td>
