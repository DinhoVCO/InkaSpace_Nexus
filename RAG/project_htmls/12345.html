The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will be launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

Since plants will be a necessary part of bioregenerative life support needed to send humans to Mars and beyond, the knowledge obtained from our spaceflight experiments will be critical for developing ways to effectively use plants in the bioregenerative life support systems. These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth. <P></td>

						Using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS), it is possible to study plant growth and development at fractional or reduced gravity levels as would be seen on the Moon or Mars. Improving the knowledge base of these basic processes is important as techniques are developed to use plants in bioregenerative life support systems for future manned missions. In the long term, a better understanding of how plants are affected by these factors helps in the development of strategies to optimize light sensing in plants and modify plant species by using biotechnological approaches to improve crop plants.                    To our knowledge, for the first time in the course of plant space biology, we have information on a physiological response (phototropism) across a continuum of gravity conditions (0.5g, 0.8g, µg, 0.1g, 0.3g, 1.0g). The final outcome of any scientific project is a peer-reviewed publication.  We are pleased to report that 22 papers resulted from NASA funding this project. [Ed.

The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will be launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

Since plants will be a necessary part of bioregenerative life support needed to send humans to Mars and beyond, the knowledge obtained from our spaceflight experiments will be critical for developing ways to effectively use plants in the bioregenerative life support systems. These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth. <P></td>

						The future of space exploration will be contingent upon the use of plants in bioregenerative life support systems. Unfortunately, the microgravity of space can cause stress in plants, which can reduce growth. The Random Positioning Machine (RPM) is a device designed to provide an analogue for the effects of microgravity on Earth by rotating in three dimensions.    <P>
In this study, we compare the results from experiments conducted on the International Space Station with those conducted using the RPM (in the 3D clinostat mode) on the ground. Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype and phytochrome mutants were grown in true microgravity and in the omnidirectional gravity on a rotating RPM on the ground. We found that the RPM treatment caused less stress in the seedlings than did true microgravity.  We also report that phytochromes A and B play roles in phototropic responses to unilateral light and that these roles differ in the two gravitational environments.  Finally, we conclude that while root phototropism in unilateral red and blue differs significantly between the microgravity and omnidirectional stimuli, the RPM can serve as a reasonable analogue of microgravity conditions for assessment of shoot phototropism. <P>

The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will be launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture.

						The Seedling Growth-2 experiment was performed in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The original experiment set-up included two runs, each 6 days long. The experiment resulted in good germination rates for Run 1 and Run 2, and the results were sufficient to a give good science return.  In addition to seed germination, the Principal Investigators (PIs) noted robust growth and phototropic curvature in all runs.    <P>
SG3 was the first experiment to employ the European Space Agency (ESA)-built FixBoxes, and the operations by the astronauts with this new hardware were nominal. Following the landing of SpaceX5, SG3 cassettes with frozen seedlings were recovered and processed at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by the PI team and ARC staff. At the end of this processing, frozen seedlings were removed from the cassettes and were placed into microfuge tubes.  These specimens were shipped to Madrid for RNA extraction and gene profiling studies by F.J. Medina and his group.  In addition, in some cases, seedlings were removed from the FixBoxes and shipped to Spain for further processing.    <P>
After identification of differentially expressed genes by RNAseq methods, a Generally Applicable Gene-Set (GAGE)-Pathway Analysis was conducted between µg and 1g gravity conditions to determine if any molecular pathways were found to be significantly enriched with genes (identified as differentially expressed) to give a more holistic view of the effects of reduced gravity on plant molecular pathways.  GAGE analysis revealed that 8 pathways were found to be significantly enriched (2 upregulated, 6 downregulated; FDR < 0.1) with genes identified as differentially expressed in the µg vs 1g group. These pathways included photosynthesis and photosynthetic antenna proteins as being significantly downregulated.    <P>
We also had some interesting results on reduced or partial gravity from our space experiments on the ISS. Seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 hours. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) tool, gene networks, and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.     <P>
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the replicates. The clustering of the replicates is consistent. There is a very clear separation among the three g-levels in the samples exposed to red light photostimulation (µgrl, Marsrl, and grrrl) but it is not well distinguished between the Marsd and grrd samples.     <P>
To elaborate on this, we have applied two different approaches to perform the comparisons in the transcriptomics data. First, to investigate the effect of different gravity levels on A. thaliana seedlings, we have compared the transcriptomes of samples grown in microgravity or Mars gravity level to the same light condition in 1-g GRR transcriptome as the reference; µgd-grrd, Marsd-grrd, µgrl-grrrl; Marsrl-grrrl. Next, to dissect the effect of red light at different g levels, we have compared the transcriptomes of seedlings grown in the same g levels but in different light conditions; µgrl-µgd, Marsrl-Marsd, grrrl-grrd. In both cases, we have used a q-value < 0.05 and a threshold fold change of Log2 FC +/- 1.5.    <P>
In the gravity level comparisons, more than 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated in µgd, µgrl, Marsrl, whereas in Marsd only half of this number (372). These results show that transcriptomes of the seedlings photostimulated by red light presented a similar number of upregulated DEGs at both gravity levels, but in seedlings grown in dark, twice as many DEGs were upregulated in microgravity than in Mars gravity. Approximately half of the upregulated DEGs are common for each gravity level independently of being exposed to darkness or photostimulation (253 and 175 in microgravity and Mars, respectively). The low number of upregulated genes in the Marsd sample is in accordance with a small size of meristematic nucleoli in this condition, suggesting a reduced rate of protein biosynthesis, meaning that the transcriptome status is reflected at the proteome level. This effect could be a result of the upregulation of Ovate Family Protein 10 (OFP10), a transcription repressor upregulated only in Marsd condition (Log2FC 2; all Log2FC values given in the text are statistically significant; q-value < 0.05).    <P>
In the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we used the total number of upregulated or downregulated DEGs to look for common and specific altered molecular functions in each condition. We observe that, in the upregulated genes, there was a clear clustering of common categories by g-levels rather than by light conditions. Among the categories upregulated in all conditions, response to osmotic stress, wounding, and cellular response to hypoxia could be identified. Photosynthesis categories are highly upregulated in microgravity, but not at Mars g-level.  It is surprising that this category is equally upregulated in both light conditions, the red-light photostimulated sample and seedlings grown in darkness for the last two days. Another strongly upregulated category in microgravity was oxidative phosphorylation. On the other hand, categories specific for Mars conditions (both light treatments) include response to ethylene, drug, defense response, and positive regulation of biosynthetic processes and organ growth.    <P>
The ethylene pathway, together with ethylene response factors (ERFs), are involved in a wide range of stress responses. Although it previously has been suggested that the detection of an ethylene response in spaceflight experiments was an effect of the ethylene accumulated from the previous experiments, any ethylene accumulation during this experiment would have been erased from the hardware by a flushing procedure performed before the initiation of the experiment as well as by constant air flow by a connected gas removal module.     <P>
The dysregulation of different hormonal routes in our samples suggests that, in microgravity, the seedlings do not address the external stress and take the option of growing by activating growth and proliferation-promoting auxin and cytokinin routes. On the other hand, in the Mars-g samples, the growth-promoting routes are inhibited and ABA, ethylene and salicylic acid routes, known for their crucial role in response to osmotic, drought and biotic stresses, are activated. These studies show the utility of spaceflight experiments in making discoveries in the fundamental biology of plants, which will be needed to fully utilize plants in bioregenerative life support systems in space missions.    <P>
Since blue-light phototropism is robust in both roots and shoots, we studied expression of our five candidate genes with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  during this tropism in light-grown wild type (WT) seedlings.  For three of the five genes (MTS, NFL, and ABC), there were changes in gene expression during the time course studies of blue phototropism.     <P>
For microtubules (MTS), the time course of curvature studies suggest that this gene attenuates phototropism in the shoots, and RT-PCR studies show a corresponding decrease in expression of this gene. MTS has been shown to be involved in organ growth and regulation of cell cycle, but this is the first report of it being involved in tropism pathways.    <P>
Like the PIN family, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins have been shown to play a role in gravitropism and phototropism; ABC transporters, are one of the largest superfamily of transmembrane transporter proteins that utilize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to carry out translocation of substrates across membranes. In plants, ABC proteins shuttle a variety of substrates such as lipids, carboxylates, heavy metals, and hormones such as auxin, across a variety of biological membranes.  Our time course of curvature studies suggest that ABC attenuates blue-light phototropism in roots. However, in contrast, RT-PCR experiments suggest that ABC gene expression increases during the same time.    <P>
In some ways, the most important finding of our studies is that a neurofilament light (NFL) protein plays a role in gravitropism and phototropism. NFL proteins are particularly fascinating because of their roles as intermediate filaments (IF).  While the existence of IFs in plants has been debated, new molecular and cytological evidence confirms that IFs do occur in plant cells. The importance of NFL also is suggested by data in the Klepikova Atlas (used in the TAIR database;  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/)">https://www.arabidopsis.org/)</a> , which provides tissue-specific profiling for many genes throughout the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Thus, tissue-specific profiling indicates that NFL shows high expression in the roots of 1-day old seedlings, and moderate expression in aerial tissue. Many studies have shown that microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton play a major role in gravitropism and phototropism, but our space studies raise the possibility that IFs also are involved in these pathways. <P>

The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will be launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth. <P></td>

						The Seedling Growth-2 experiment was performed in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) on board the International Space Station (ISS). The original experiment setup included two runs, each 6 days long. The experiment resulted in good germination rates for Run 1 and Run 2, and the results were sufficient to a give good science return.  In addition to seed germination, the Principal Investigator (PI) teams noted robust growth and phototropic curvature in all runs.     <P>
Seedling Growth-3 (SG3) was the first experiment to employ the European Space Agency (ESA)-built FixBoxes, and the operations by the astronauts with this new hardware were nominal. Following the landing of SpaceX5, SG3 cassettes with frozen seedlings were recovered and processed at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by the PI team and ARC staff. At the end of this processing, frozen seedlings were removed from the cassettes and were placed into microfuge tubes.  These specimens were shipped to Madrid for RNA extraction and gene profiling studies by Co-PI F.J. Medina and his group.  In addition, in some cases, seedlings were removed from the FixBoxes and shipped to Spain for further processing.    <P>
After identification of differentially expressed genes by RNAseq methods, a Generally Applicable Gene-Set (GAGE)-Pathway Analysis was conducted between microgravity and 1g conditions to determine if any molecular pathways were found to be significantly enriched with genes (identified as differentially expressed) to give a more holistic view of the effects of reduced gravity on plant molecular pathways.  GAGE analysis revealed that 8 pathways were found to be significantly enriched (2 upregulated, 6 downregulated; FDR < 0.1) with genes identified as differentially expressed in the microgravity vs 1g group. These pathways included photosynthesis and photosynthetic antenna proteins as being significantly downregulated.    <P>
We also had some interesting results on reduced or partial gravity from our space experiments on the ISS. Seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely microgravity, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 hours. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using GEDI tool, gene networks, and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.     <P>
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the replicates: The clustering of the replicates is consistent. There is a very clear separation among the three g-levels in the samples exposed to red light photostimulation (µgrl, Marsrl and grrrl) but it is not well distinguished between the Marsd and grrd samples.     <P>
To elaborate on this, we have applied two different approaches to perform the comparisons in the transcriptomics data. First, to investigate the effect of different gravity levels on A. thaliana seedlings, we have compared the transcriptomes of samples grown in microgravity or Mars gravity level to the same light condition in 1g GRR transcriptome as the reference; µgd-grrd, Marsd-grrd, µgrl-grrrl; Marsrl-grrrl. Next, to dissect the effect of red light at different g levels, we have compared the transcriptomes of seedlings grown in the same g levels but in different light conditions; µgrl-µgd; Marsrl-Marsd, grrrl-grrd. In both cases, we have used a q-value < 0.05 and a threshold fold change of Log2 FC +/- 1.5.    <P>
In the gravity level comparisons, more than 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated in µgd, µgrl, Marsrl whereas in Marsd only half of this number (372) were upregulated. These results show that transcriptomes of the seedlings photostimulated by red light presented a similar number of upregulated DEGs at both gravity levels, but in seedlings grown in the dark, twice as many DEGs were upregulated in microgravity than in Mars gravity. Approximately half of the upregulated DEGs are common for each gravity level independently of being exposed to darkness or photostimulation (253 and 175 in microgravity and Mars gravity, respectively). The low number of upregulated genes in the Marsd sample is in accordance with a small size of meristematic nucleoli in this condition, suggesting a reduced rate of protein biosynthesis, meaning that the transcriptome status is reflected at the proteome level. This effect could be a result of the upregulation of Ovate Family Protein 10 (OFP10), a transcription repressor upregulated only in the Marsd condition (Log2FC 2; all Log2FC values given in the text are statistically significant; q-value < 0.05).    <P>
In the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we used the total number of upregulated or downregulated DEGs to look for common and specific altered molecular functions in each condition. We observed that, in the upregulated genes, there was a clear clustering of common categories by g-levels rather than by light conditions. Among the categories upregulated in all conditions, response to osmotic stress, wounding, and cellular response to hypoxia could be identified. Photosynthesis categories are highly upregulated in microgravity, but not at Mars g-level.  It is surprising that this category is equally upregulated in both light conditions – the red-light photostimulated sample and the seedlings grown in darkness for two days. Another strongly upregulated category in microgravity was oxidative phosphorylation. On the other hand, categories specific for Mars conditions (both light treatments) include response to ethylene, drug, defense response, and positive regulation of biosynthetic processes and organ growth.  The ethylene pathway, together with Ethylene Response Factors (ERFs), are involved in a wide range of stress responses. Although it has been suggested previously that the detection of an ethylene response in spaceflight experiments was an effect of the ethylene accumulated from the previous experiments, any ethylene accumulation during this experiment would have been erased from the hardware by a flushing procedure performed before the initiation of the experiment, as well as by constant air flow by a connected gas removal module.     <P>
The dysregulation of different hormonal routes in our samples suggests that, in microgravity, the seedlings do not address the external stress and take the option of growing by activating growth and proliferation-promoting auxin and cytokinin routes. On the other hand, in the Mars g samples, the growth-promoting routes are inhibited and abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and salicylic acid routes, known for their crucial role in response to osmotic, drought, and biotic stresses, are activated. These studies show the utility of spaceflight experiments in making discoveries in the fundamental biology of plants, which will be needed to fully utilize plants in bioregenerative life support systems in space missions.    <P>
Since blue-light phototropism is robust in both roots and shoots, we studied expression of our five candidate genes with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during this tropism in light-grown wild type (WT) seedlings.  For three of the five genes (MTS, NFL, and ABC), there were changes in gene expression during the time course studies of blue-light phototropism.     <P>
For MTS, the time course of curvature studies suggests that this gene attenuates phototropism in the shoots, and RT-PCR studies show a corresponding decrease in expression of this gene. MTS has been shown to be involved in organ growth and regulation of cell cycle, but this is the first report of it being involved in tropism pathways.    <P>
Like the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family, ABC proteins have been shown to play a role in gravitropism and phototropism. ATP-BINDING CASSETTE (ABC) transporters are one of the largest superfamily of transmembrane transporter proteins that utilize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to carry out translocation of substrates across membranes. In plants, ABC proteins shuttle a variety of substrates such as lipids, carboxylates, heavy metals, and hormones such as auxin, across a variety of biological membranes.  Our time course of curvature studies suggest that ABC attenuates blue-light phototropism in roots. However, in contrast, RT-PCR experiments suggest that ABC gene expression increases during the same time.  In some ways, the most important finding of our studies is that NFL plays a role in gravitropism and phototropism. NFL proteins are particularly fascinating because of their role as intermediate filaments (IF).  While the existence of IFs in plants has been debated, new molecular and cytological evidence confirms that IFs do occur in plant cells. The importance of NFL also is suggested by data in the Klepikova Atlas (used in the TAIR database;  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arabidopsis.org">https://www.arabidopsis.org</a>  ), which provides tissue-specific profiling for many genes throughout the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Thus, tissue-specific profiling indicates that NFL shows high expression in the roots of 1-day old seedlings, and moderate expression in aerial tissue. Many studies have shown that microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton play a major role in gravitropism and phototropism, but our space studies raise the possibility that IFs also are involved in these pathways. <P>

The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will be launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth. <P></td>

						Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth’s gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses (tropisms) under partial gravity conditions. Here we show results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 hours. RNA was extracted from 20 samples (pools of 10-15 seedlings each) for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.     <P>
Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene across all gravity conditions using false discovery rate (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro-g, the Moon g-level, or the intermediate low-g level (< 0.1g) with 1g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of variations was similar in microgravity and the Moon g-level and increased in the intermediate g-level (< 0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g-level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical, and hormone responses under low-g and a response more related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g-level.    <P>
Plant transcriptional response under blue light stimulation suggests that recently described root blue-phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism on orbit. Competition between tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro-g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. A conspicuous effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling, detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity, can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.    <P>
Our other spaceflight studies show the dysregulation of different hormonal routes in our samples and suggest that, in microgravity, the seedlings do not address the external stress and take the option of growing by activating growth and proliferation-promoting auxin and cytokinin routes. On the other hand, in the Mars-g samples, the growth-promoting routes are inhibited and abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and salicylic acid routes, known for their crucial role in response to osmotic, drought, and biotic stresses, are activated. These studies show the utility of spaceflight experiments in making discoveries in the fundamental biology of plants, which will be needed to fully utilize plants in bioregenerative life support systems in space missions. <P>

See that project for previous reports]     <P>
The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

Since plants will be a necessary part of bioregenerative life support needed to send humans to Mars and beyond, the knowledge obtained from our spaceflight experiments will be critical for developing ways to effectively use plants in the bioregenerative life support systems. These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth. <P></td>

						The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses (tropisms) under partial gravity conditions. Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 hours. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using GEDI (Gene Expression Data Interpreter) tool, gene networks, and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.     <P>
Gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR (false discovery rate) correction (q<0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro-g, low-g level (<0.1g) or the Moon g-level, or the intermediate low-g level (<0.1g)  with 1g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g-level and increased in the intermediate g-level (<0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g-level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low-g and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g-level.    <P>
Plant transcriptional response under blue light stimulation suggests that recently described root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism on orbit. Competition between tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro-g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms. <P>

See that project for previous reports]     <P>
The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

Since plants will be a necessary part of bioregenerative life support needed to send humans to Mars and beyond, the knowledge obtained from our spaceflight experiments will be critical for developing ways to effectively use plants in the bioregenerative life support systems. These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth. <P></td>

						We utilized the condition of microgravity on board the International Space Station (ISS) to identify genes involved in the interaction between light responses (phototropism) and gravity responses (gravitropism) in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings.  Seedlings were grown on the ISS, and RNA was extracted from 7 samples (pools of 10-15 plants) grown in microgravity (µg) or Earth gravity conditions (1.0 g). Transcriptomic analysis of differential gene expression was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq2 RNASeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized by using Pathway Analysis as well as enrichment for Gene Ontology classifications.     <P>
296 genes were found to be significantly differentially expressed between microgravity when compared to 1-g controls (p < 0.05). In addition, Pathway Analysis identified 8 molecular pathways that are significantly affected by reduced gravity conditions. Specifically, light-associated pathways (e.g., photosynthesis-antenna proteins, photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism) show significant downregulation.    <P>
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown in conditions of microgravity show significant alterations to gene expression when compared to the 1-g control. Understanding the interactions between these two essential tropistic responses not only furthers our fundamental understanding, but may also help to efficiently grow plants during long-range space missions. In addition, this study is the first to use RNAseq tools to study the interactions between tropisms in a spaceflight study. <P>

See that project for previous reports]     <P>
The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

Since plants will be a necessary part of bioregenerative life support needed to send humans to Mars and beyond, the knowledge obtained from our spaceflight experiments will be critical for developing ways to effectively use plants in the bioregenerative life support systems. These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth. <P></td>

						GENERAL SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES:    <P>
1. Seedling Growth-3 space experiment was performed on the ISS during the SpaceX-11 mission in June 2017.    <P>
2. Samples were returned on SpaceX-11 in July 2017.  These consisted of frozen and fixed seedlings.    <P>
3. We are in the process of cytological analyses of samples.    <P>
4. We also are performing RNAseq analysis, and the results will be deposited in NASA's GeneLab.    <P>
5. We also are doing image analysis of the samples to study growth, development, and tropistic curvature.    <P>
SPECIFIC RESULTS FROM SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIMENT:    <P>
Plants will play an important role in the future of space exploration as part of bioregenerative life support. Thus, it is important to understand the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on gene expression in plant development. We analyzed the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana grown is space. The bioinformatics methods used included RMA (Robust Multi-Array Average), MAS5 (Microarray Suite 5.0), PLIER (Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error Estimation). Glycome profiling was utilized to analyze cell wall composition in the samples. In addition, our results were compared to those of two other groups using the same hardware on the same mission. In these space experiments, we noted expression changes in genes involved in hypoxia, heatshock, DNA repair, and cell wall structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. In addition, glycome profiling supported our expression analyses in that there was a difference in cell wall components between ground control and spaceflight-grown plants. A common theme from our space experiments and those of the other two groups was the down-regulation of water stress response genes in spaceflight. In addition, all three studies found differential regulation of genes associated with cell wall remodeling and stress responses between spaceflight-grown and ground control plants. <P>

NOTE 12/11/2017: Continuation of "Novel Explorations Into the Interactions Between Light and Gravity Sensing in Plants--NNX12AO65G," per PI move from University of Mississippi to University of North Carolina at Greensboro. See that project for previous reports]     <P>
The major goals of this project are to determine how gravity and light responses influence each other in plants and to better understand the cellular signaling mechanisms involved in plant tropisms. This proposed project builds on our previous spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) with the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) using the model plant Arabidopsis. In this new proposed project, we plan to confirm and extend our discovery during the recent ISS experiment of a novel red-light-based positive phototropic response in plant shoots. Our hypothesis is that positive red-light-sensing, which was known in older plant lineages, is masked by normal 1-g conditions in more recently evolved lineages. We also propose to investigate fundamental interactions among red and blue light signaling pathways and the gravity sensing mechanisms. The ISS is the only laboratory facility where it is possible to reliably and simultaneously vary light and gravity stimuli for the proposed experiments.    <P>
These experiments can be accomplished with telemetric science and therefore fit with the extremely limited down mass capabilities of current spaceflight opportunities. The EMCS is an automated facility and can be operated largely with telemetry. Experimental containers will launched via Space-X, and during an experimental run, images of seedling growth responses can be downlinked to Earth.    <P>
A significant advantage of this proposed project is that we will use existing flight hardware that has been flown successfully and allowed for growth of Arabidopsis seedlings in the EMCS. This project is also relevant to the recent emphasis at NASA to study plant growth and development at fractional g-levels such as those found on the moon and Mars. Improved knowledge of the basic mechanistic processes that will be the focus of this project is vital to develop ways to use plants in extraterrestrial bioregenerative life support systems. <P></td>

Since plants will be a necessary part of bioregenerative life support needed to send humans to Mars and beyond, the knowledge obtained from our spaceflight experiments will be critical for developing ways to effectively use plants in the bioregenerative life support systems. These life support systems also can be used in ground-based Earth applications such as the design of large-scale greenhouses to support crop plants and agriculture. In addition, improved knowledge of light and gravity systems in plants will, in the long term, allow us to develop better crop plants for use on Earth. <P></td>
