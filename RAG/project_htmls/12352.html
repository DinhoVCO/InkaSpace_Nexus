                    <td colspan="3"> This project brings established research from NASA funded science on the International Space Station (ISS) into an international project led by DLR (German Space Agency) toward the functionalization of plant growth in support of human exploration. Imaging technologies developed as part of ongoing ISS science will be deployed within the Antarctic EDEN ISS plant production unit to provide tele-science support and plant science analytics to better understand the responses of plants, and production support to optimize plant performance.    <P>
Plant production for advanced life support within deep space and extraterrestrial colonies has long been an appreciated area of technology development. Indeed ISS science is now turning toward small scale plant production in space, and plant production units in extreme environments on Earth have proven the value of fresh food. However, there has as yet to be any integrated tests of plant production within space vehicle-like structures in extreme analog environments. To address this gap in knowledge, the EDEN ISS project by the DLR German space agency is designed to place an ISS-inspired module in the context of an established Antarctic station, drawing together for the first time structures and production units designed to space vehicle formats together with the challenges of an extreme and isolated environment. In keeping with the spirit and intent of the EDEN ISS project, the current proposal seeks to fund US participation, bringing plant imaging technologies developed, in part from extensive Shuttle and ISS plant growth experiments, into the science to be conducted within EDEN ISS. The area of fidelity to be addressed by this project is a series of science investigations designed to further planetary research in terrestrial extreme environments that may be analogous to those found on other planets.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project is constructing essential controlled environment agriculture technologies using both an International Standard Payload Rack cultivation system to relate to on-board ISS and cis-lunar deployments for crew food supplementation, and a Future Exploration Greenhouse that is designed with respect to future planetary bioregenerative life support system deployments. The overall physical facility, referred to as the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility, will provide realistic mass flow and will deploy to the highly-isolated Antarctic Neumayer Station III, operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute.    <P>
Among the technologies to be developed and deployed will be imagers designed by the University of Florida (UF) Principal Investigator (PI) team, through this proposed project, to monitor plant health within the Mobile Test Facility. Our major goal is to equip the plant growth systems with information-rich imaging such that plant health and basic science data can be reviewed by a large and integrated science backroom back on “Earth.” An additional goal is to optimize the conceptual connections between EDEN ISS and current ISS capabilities and operations. These two goals bring a directed focus to the project, connecting the planetary surface analog concepts to near term operations of ISS and potential cis-lunar habitats.    <P>
To accomplish these goals, spectral imaging of plants will be incorporated into typical data monitoring systems and operation of the project. EDEN ISS, as a large multinational project, has an extensive Data Management Plan (DMP). The work proposed here will depend and draw upon the EDEN ISS DMP for the overall project data, and will specifically draw Mobile Test Facility (MTF) plant growth images and operations images as primary data for analysis and management by the UF team. The UF team will archive and make available all plant health images specific to our tasks via a separate project within the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). The technology is based on small, robust cameras that image wavelengths related to previous and future ISS hardware such that data from EDEN ISS will provide feed forward science for known and anticipated ISS and habitat plant growth hardware. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Exploration mission scenarios are increasingly engaging plant production as adjunct or major parts of life support. This is especially true for deep space and extraterrestrial surface scenarios, and there have been several lower fidelity projects that include plant production in analog tests of such scenarios. Plant growth has been a part of some simulations, and small-scale production type plant growth units are currently on the ISS. However, in none of these cases has an exploration-realistic plant growth facility been incorporated into a challenging analog site such as Antarctica to move the technology significantly toward anticipated mission structures and operations. And none incorporated sophisticated plant imaging into remote science backrooms. The EDEN ISS project is envisioned to fill that large gap, placing an ISS-inspired module near the German Antarctic Neumayer Station III. The EDEN ISS project is an active, funded project that involves a wide international team and is led by the German Aerospace Center, DLR. We have been invited to contribute our presence, expertise, and imaging technology to EDEN ISS. Opportunities for non-European participation at Neumayer III are rare, and EDEN ISS is unique in its magnitude and fidelity. This proposal seeks to seize the opportunity for important imaging technology advancement and US participation within the multinational context of the EDEN ISS project.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project seeks to create a structurally and operationally realistic analog to a space station, vehicular, or planetary habitat plant growth module for life support. As such, the project falls under the purview of Space Exploration and Spaceport Technology Development (SESTD) in several subcategories: In-Situ Resource Utilization Technologies (in that EDEN is dedicated to local production of food for bioregenerative Advanced Life Support), Lunar and Mars Base/Settlement Technologies (in that we will be within a robust simulation of life support technologies), and also Advanced Sensors and Detectors (in that we will be developing imaging cameras for monitoring plant health within the facility). As a working production facility, EDEN ISS will provide fresh produce to Neumayer III overwintering crews. And in the process, the project will validate key plant growth system technologies and operational protocols for use on the ISS and within future planetary bioregenerative life support systems -- a key set of technologies for long duration spaceflight and planetary habitation.    <P>
The project also has the potential to substantially contribute to plant health monitoring technology in terrestrial environments. Protected agriculture (production greenhouses and other crop facilities that are environmentally controlled or where climate is ameliorated) is a rapidly growing field in a world with expanding needs for food, and expanding regions of marginal crop land. Robotic tending and monitoring approaches are being embraced as time and resources saving tactics, and the type of health monitoring we are employing at EDEN ISS will contribute to the sophisticated tool box being employed in this expanding technology. <P></td>

Following work done with James Goodman of HySpeed Computing.   Demonstration of Onboard Image-Based Plant Health Monitoring using ENVI in Space    <P>
Developing automated systems for managing plant cultivation are important for the success of long-duration space missions. Towards that objective, we are utilizing the compute capabilities of the ENVI in Space mission to demonstrate a methodology for image-based monitoring of plant health on the International Space Station (ISS). ENVI in Space has deployed a full enterprise version of the industry leading image processing and analysis software ENVI® on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Spaceborne Computer-2 (SBC-2), which is located on the ISS. SBC-2 is the first commercial off-the-shelf high performance edge computing system with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities built for in-space data processing. Through this system, ENVI is being used to illustrate the advantages of onboard computing for an array of imaging applications, from Earth observation to space exploration. Here we are utilizing multispectral timeseries of plant images from the EDEN-ISS project and other controlled laboratory experiments to showcase image analysis capabilities for automated monitoring of plant health. This includes a full data processing workflow, from data ingest and pre-processing to spectral computations and statistical analysis. Results are generated in a user-friendly format to simplify interpretation and streamline future implementation as an automated plant management tool.     <P>

Work done in conjunction with Dr. Sanjeev Koppal and Ms. Anna Hampton.    <P>
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown exceptional performance in exploiting spatial relationships in image data. Given that the key indications of saline induced stress in our sample is loss of turgor pressure and leaf shrinkage, we have chosen to employ a CNN to extract feature maps. Following the convolutional layers, the features are linearized and passed through fully connected layers with the final layer producing the predicted time since stress. As far as image preprocessing, images were broken down into the four quadrants that correspond to the 4 plates. Labels for each quadrant image were generated based on time since stress exposure. The images pre-stress (or within the buffer times) and the control quadrant images are assigned a label of 0. A buffer region post application of saline is being used to ensure we have sufficient time for stress to set in before we assign a label indicating stress is present. We are experimenting with two different types of labeling, one with basic time since stress and one with exponentiated time since stress. The exponentiated time since stress is being tested because the network may learn better if there is a larger distinction between stress and non-stress images.    <P>
Project Summary (Ed., November 27, 2022)    <P>
The spectral imaging project has moved forward the understanding of a deployable Plant Health Monitoring system for future off-Earth applications. The ability to build, calibrate and deploy an imager system, that cannot only detect early signs of stress in a plant, but that can also facilitate and early response will be important as enclosed life support systems become commonplace in off-Earth environments. The addition of potential on board processing and AI image analysis will continue to improve the future of plant heath detection systems in the future. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This project brings established research from NASA funded science on the International Space Station (ISS) into an international project led by DLR (German Space Agency) toward the functionalization of plant growth in support of human exploration. Imaging technologies developed as part of ongoing ISS science will be deployed within the Antarctic EDEN ISS plant production unit to provide tele-science support and plant science analytics to better understand the responses of plants, and production support to optimize plant performance.    <P>
Plant production for advanced life support within deep space and extraterrestrial colonies has long been an appreciated area of technology development. Indeed ISS science is now turning toward small scale plant production in space, and plant production units in extreme environments on Earth have proven the value of fresh food. However, there has as yet to be any integrated tests of plant production within space vehicle-like structures in extreme analog environments. To address this gap in knowledge, the EDEN ISS project by the DLR German space agency is designed to place an ISS-inspired module in the context of an established Antarctic station, drawing together for the first time structures and production units designed to space vehicle formats together with the challenges of an extreme and isolated environment. In keeping with the spirit and intent of the EDEN ISS project, the current proposal seeks to fund US participation, bringing plant imaging technologies developed, in part from extensive Shuttle and ISS plant growth experiments, into the science to be conducted within EDEN ISS. The area of fidelity to be addressed by this project is a series of science investigations designed to further planetary research in terrestrial extreme environments that may be analogous to those found on other planets.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project is constructing essential controlled environment agriculture technologies using both an International Standard Payload Rack cultivation system to relate to on-board ISS and cis-lunar deployments for crew food supplementation, and a Future Exploration Greenhouse that is designed with respect to future planetary bioregenerative life support system deployments. The overall physical facility, referred to as the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility, will provide realistic mass flow and will deploy to the highly-isolated Antarctic Neumayer Station III, operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute.    <P>
Among the technologies to be developed and deployed will be imagers designed by the University of Florida (UF) Principal Investigator (PI) team, through this proposed project, to monitor plant health within the Mobile Test Facility. Our major goal is to equip the plant growth systems with information-rich imaging such that plant health and basic science data can be reviewed by a large and integrated science backroom back on “Earth.” An additional goal is to optimize the conceptual connections between EDEN ISS and current ISS capabilities and operations. These two goals bring a directed focus to the project, connecting the planetary surface analog concepts to near term operations of ISS and potential cis-lunar habitats.    <P>
To accomplish these goals, spectral imaging of plants will be incorporated into typical data monitoring systems and operation of the project. EDEN ISS, as a large multinational project, has an extensive Data Management Plan (DMP). The work proposed here will depend and draw upon the EDEN ISS DMP for the overall project data, and will specifically draw Mobile Test Facility (MTF) plant growth images and operations images as primary data for analysis and management by the UF team. The UF team will archive and make available all plant health images specific to our tasks via a separate project within the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). The technology is based on small, robust cameras that image wavelengths related to previous and future ISS hardware such that data from EDEN ISS will provide feed forward science for known and anticipated ISS and habitat plant growth hardware. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Exploration mission scenarios are increasingly engaging plant production as adjunct or major parts of life support. This is especially true for deep space and extraterrestrial surface scenarios, and there have been several lower fidelity projects that include plant production in analog tests of such scenarios. Plant growth has been a part of some simulations, and small-scale production type plant growth units are currently on the ISS. However, in none of these cases has an exploration-realistic plant growth facility been incorporated into a challenging analog site such as Antarctica to move the technology significantly toward anticipated mission structures and operations. And none incorporated sophisticated plant imaging into remote science backrooms. The EDEN ISS project is envisioned to fill that large gap, placing an ISS-inspired module near the German Antarctic Neumayer Station III. The EDEN ISS project is an active, funded project that involves a wide international team and is led by the German Aerospace Center, DLR. We have been invited to contribute our presence, expertise, and imaging technology to EDEN ISS. Opportunities for non-European participation at Neumayer III are rare, and EDEN ISS is unique in its magnitude and fidelity. This proposal seeks to seize the opportunity for important imaging technology advancement and US participation within the multinational context of the EDEN ISS project.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project seeks to create a structurally and operationally realistic analog to a space station, vehicular, or planetary habitat plant growth module for life support. As such, the project falls under the purview of Space Exploration and Spaceport Technology Development (SESTD) in several subcategories: In-Situ Resource Utilization Technologies (in that EDEN is dedicated to local production of food for bioregenerative Advanced Life Support), Lunar and Mars Base/Settlement Technologies (in that we will be within a robust simulation of life support technologies), and also Advanced Sensors and Detectors (in that we will be developing imaging cameras for monitoring plant health within the facility). As a working production facility, EDEN ISS will provide fresh produce to Neumayer III overwintering crews. And in the process, the project will validate key plant growth system technologies and operational protocols for use on the ISS and within future planetary bioregenerative life support systems -- a key set of technologies for long duration spaceflight and planetary habitation.    <P>
The project also has the potential to substantially contribute to plant health monitoring technology in terrestrial environments. Protected agriculture (production greenhouses and other crop facilities that are environmentally controlled or where climate is ameliorated) is a rapidly growing field in a world with expanding needs for food, and expanding regions of marginal crop land. Robotic tending and monitoring approaches are being embraced as time and resources saving tactics, and the type of health monitoring we are employing at EDEN ISS will contribute to the sophisticated tool box being employed in this expanding technology. <P></td>

EDEN ISS Redeployment. Image analysis from the past GoPro and HikVision camera deployments determined that the optimal filter to use in the project was the NDVI-7 dual bandpass filter. In 2019, Principal Investigators (PIs) deployed six “plant health” cameras in EDEN ISS, with three different filter options. This year the goal was to transition the 4 cameras that were not currently fitted with the NDVI-7 (normalized difference vegetation index) filter, to be upgraded to this filter. This would allow consistent data collection for six different locations in EDEN ISS. A Kennedy Space Center (KSC) colleague traveled with the EDEN team to Antarctica in fall of 2020. They agreed to transport and install the upgrades to the cameras. However, due to cleaning and upgrades that had to be done to the chamber the new filters were not installed until March 2021. These upgrades are currently returning daily images.    <P>
Color Mutant Work. While development of the technology for plant health imaging is ongoing, the continued study of what the plant physiological indicators of health are continues as well. The lab has selected and is screening 18 color mutant lines from TAIR that may help elucidate the nature of the changes in both the NDVI value and the NIR (near infrared) spectrum of a plant.     <P>
New Camera work - the NDVI-7 filter and the Pixelcam 4 channel imager. While customarily we have used a NDVI-7 filter on a COTS RGB (commercial off the shelf red green blue) camera, this experiment added the use of the Salvo Pixelcam that allows us to study different wavelengths of light reflectance. These filters/imagers were then used to image the pigment mutants to determine wavelengths of interest. Early imaging with these two filters has show differences in the NDVI value of mutant plants, demonstrating that while there appears to be no difference in NDVI value of the mutants vs. Col-0 wild type under the NDVI-7 filter, there does appear to be a difference when using the Pixelcam imager. <P>

In keeping with the spirit and intent of the EDEN ISS project, the current proposal seeks to fund US participation, bringing plant imaging technologies developed, in part from extensive Shuttle and ISS plant growth experiments, into the science to be conducted within EDEN ISS. The area of fidelity to be addressed by this project is a series of science investigations designed to further planetary research in terrestrial extreme environments that may be analogous to those found on other planets.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project is constructing essential controlled environment agriculture technologies using both an International Standard Payload Rack cultivation system to relate to on-board ISS and cis-lunar deployments for crew food supplementation, and a Future Exploration Greenhouse that is designed with respect to future planetary bioregenerative life support system deployments. The overall physical facility, referred to as the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility, will provide realistic mass flow and will deploy to the highly-isolated Antarctic Neumayer Station III, operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute.    <P>
Among the technologies to be developed and deployed will be imagers designed by the University of Florida (UF) Principal Investigator (PI) team, through this proposed project, to monitor plant health within the Mobile Test Facility. Our major goal is to equip the plant growth systems with information-rich imaging such that plant health and basic science data can be reviewed by a large and integrated science backroom back on “Earth.” An additional goal is to optimize the conceptual connections between EDEN ISS and current ISS capabilities and operations. These two goals bring a directed focus to the project, connecting the planetary surface analog concepts to near term operations of ISS and potential cis-lunar habitats.    <P>
To accomplish these goals, spectral imaging of plants will be incorporated into typical data monitoring systems and operation of the project. EDEN ISS, as a large multinational project, has an extensive Data Management Plan (DMP). The work proposed here will depend and draw upon the EDEN ISS DMP for the overall project data, and will specifically draw Mobile Test Facility (MTF) plant growth images and operations images as primary data for analysis and management by the UF team. The UF team will archive and make available all plant health images specific to our tasks via a separate project within the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). The technology is based on small, robust cameras that image wavelengths related to previous and future ISS hardware such that data from EDEN ISS will provide feed forward science for known and anticipated ISS and habitat plant growth hardware. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Exploration mission scenarios are increasingly engaging plant production as adjunct or major parts of life support. This is especially true for deep space and extraterrestrial surface scenarios, and there have been several lower fidelity projects that include plant production in analog tests of such scenarios. Plant growth has been a part of some simulations, and small-scale production type plant growth units are currently on the ISS. However, in none of these cases has an exploration-realistic plant growth facility been incorporated into a challenging analog site such as Antarctica to move the technology significantly toward anticipated mission structures and operations. And none incorporated sophisticated plant imaging into remote science backrooms. The EDEN ISS project is envisioned to fill that large gap, placing an ISS-inspired module near the German Antarctic Neumayer Station III. The EDEN ISS project is an active, funded project that involves a wide international team and is led by the German Aerospace Center, DLR. We have been invited to contribute our presence, expertise, and imaging technology to EDEN ISS. Opportunities for non-European participation at Neumayer III are rare, and EDEN ISS is unique in its magnitude and fidelity. This proposal seeks to seize the opportunity for important imaging technology advancement and US participation within the multinational context of the EDEN ISS project.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project seeks to create a structurally and operationally realistic analog to a space station, vehicular, or planetary habitat plant growth module for life support. As such, the project falls under the purview of Space Exploration and Spaceport Technology Development (SESTD) in several subcategories: In-Situ Resource Utilization Technologies (in that EDEN is dedicated to local production of food for bioregenerative Advanced Life Support), Lunar and Mars Base/Settlement Technologies (in that we will be within a robust simulation of life support technologies), and also Advanced Sensors and Detectors (in that we will be developing imaging cameras for monitoring plant health within the facility). As a working production facility, EDEN ISS will provide fresh produce to Neumayer III overwintering crews. And in the process, the project will validate key plant growth system technologies and operational protocols for use on the ISS and within future planetary bioregenerative life support systems -- a key set of technologies for long duration spaceflight and planetary habitation.    <P>
The project also has the potential to substantially contribute to plant health monitoring technology in terrestrial environments. Protected agriculture (production greenhouses and other crop facilities that are environmentally controlled or where climate is ameliorated) is a rapidly growing field in a world with expanding needs for food, and expanding regions of marginal crop land. Robotic tending and monitoring approaches are being embraced as time and resources saving tactics, and the type of health monitoring we are employing at EDEN ISS will contribute to the sophisticated tool box being employed in this expanding technology. <P></td>

						Veggie Camera & Hardware Update: Progress over the last year on the project has been minimal and in line with spending on the project.  Due to delays in integration with Veggie, testing the Brinno cameras has not been fully completed.  Over the past year, testing under Veggie comparable lighting has begun to help us understand the use of the Brinno camera and bandpass filters with possible lighting scenarios.      <P>
EDEN ISS Updates: Work has been ongoing with the images returned from EDEN ISS at Neumayer III in Antarctica.   During the past year, six cameras have been operating using three different filter types have been returning daily images of crops.  These studies have been used to determine preferred filter type, and to develop growth curves for individual crops.      <P>
With different crops over the course of the year, and different camera filter options, development of curve dynamics by plant type has begun.  Variation in the growth curves can indicate an arising issue in the plants development. <P>

Plant production for advanced life support within deep space and extraterrestrial colonies has long been an appreciated area of technology development.

EDEN ISS, as a large multinational project, has an extensive Data Management Plan (DMP). The work proposed here will depend and draw upon the EDEN ISS DMP for the overall project data, and will specifically draw Mobile Test Facility (MTF) plant growth images and operations images as primary data for analysis and management by the UF team. The UF team will archive and make available all plant health images specific to our tasks via a separate project within the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). The technology is based on small, robust cameras that image wavelengths related to previous and future ISS hardware such that data from EDEN ISS will provide feed forward science for known and anticipated ISS and habitat plant growth hardware. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Exploration mission scenarios are increasingly engaging plant production as adjunct or major parts of life support. This is especially true for deep space and extraterrestrial surface scenarios, and there have been several lower fidelity projects that include plant production in analog tests of such scenarios. Plant growth has been a part of some simulations, and small-scale production type plant growth units are currently on the ISS. However, in none of these cases has an exploration-realistic plant growth facility been incorporated into a challenging analog site such as Antarctica to move the technology significantly toward anticipated mission structures and operations. And none incorporated sophisticated plant imaging into remote science backrooms. The EDEN ISS project is envisioned to fill that large gap, placing an ISS-inspired module near the German Antarctic Neumayer Station III. The EDEN ISS project is an active, funded project that involves a wide international team and is led by the German Aerospace Center, DLR. We have been invited to contribute our presence, expertise, and imaging technology to EDEN ISS. Opportunities for non-European participation at Neumayer III are rare, and EDEN ISS is unique in its magnitude and fidelity. This proposal seeks to seize the opportunity for important imaging technology advancement and US participation within the multinational context of the EDEN ISS project.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project seeks to create a structurally and operationally realistic analog to a space station, vehicular, or planetary habitat plant growth module for life support. As such, the project falls under the purview of Space Exploration and Spaceport Technology Development (SESTD) in several subcategories: In-Situ Resource Utilization Technologies (in that EDEN is dedicated to local production of food for bioregenerative Advanced Life Support), Lunar and Mars Base/Settlement Technologies (in that we will be within a robust simulation of life support technologies), and also Advanced Sensors and Detectors (in that we will be developing imaging cameras for monitoring plant health within the facility). As a working production facility, EDEN ISS will provide fresh produce to Neumayer III overwintering crews. And in the process, the project will validate key plant growth system technologies and operational protocols for use on the ISS and within future planetary bioregenerative life support systems -- a key set of technologies for long duration spaceflight and planetary habitation.    <P>
The project also has the potential to substantially contribute to plant health monitoring technology in terrestrial environments. Protected agriculture (production greenhouses and other crop facilities that are environmentally controlled or where climate is ameliorated) is a rapidly growing field in a world with expanding needs for food, and expanding regions of marginal crop land. Robotic tending and monitoring approaches are being embraced as time and resources saving tactics, and the type of health monitoring we are employing at EDEN ISS will contribute to the sophisticated tool box being employed in this expanding technology. <P></td>

						2019 Investigator Expedition     <P>
Dr. Robert Ferl and Dr. Anna-Lisa Paul traveled to Neumeyer III Antarctica Research Station in January 2019 for a four week expedition departing from Cape Town, South Africa.  While onsite, PIs updated GoPro Imagers and modified the HikVision cameras  to add to the filtered imaging options available to monitor plant health in the FEG (Future Exploration Greenhouse).      <P>
2019 EDEN Imaging    <P>
In 2019 PI’s recalibrated some of the original GoPro cameras and also modified and installed six new cameras based on the Hikvision network cameras being used as part of the other imaging system in the FEG. Modifications were done at Neumeyer III.     <P>
Three different filters were used:     <P>
1.	NDVI-7 – the original NDVI filter. These are thin and small enough to fit in-frame with the existing housing, and could be set in place with a dot of super glue    <P>
2.	New Dual Band Pass filters (DBP) – These are round, thick glass with optical coatings. These round filters were about 1 mm too wide to fit perfectly into the Hikvision camera framework, so one edge was ground down with a steel file to enable a flush fit. Filer was secured with dots of super glue on edges     <P>
3.	Blue film (BF) – an economical option suitable for educational outreach applications; schools could easily purchase and adapt these filters, also easily cut to fit with scissors.    <P>
After the filters were secured and glue dry, the cameras were individually focused before the cameras were reassembled into their housing.    <P>
The UF cameras were installed in seven different locations throughout the FEG to monitor a variety of crops. The Hikvision deployment of the original NDVI-7 filter is being compared to the new DBP filter in Hikvision cameras by using both to observe the same tray of plants (bush tomatoes in L1). The single remaining GoPro NDVI-7 camera was deployed to monitor a set of NASA-relevant crops in R1.     <P>
Veggie Camera Development    <P>
Early work has been done to develop a plant health monitoring imager for the Veggie hardware aboard the ISS.  A new camera that fits the needs and requirements of the hardware has been selected, Brinno TLC200 Pro and has been fitted with the IR corrected lens and necessary adapters.  The Brinno camera can operate for approximately 1 and a half months, taking 1-2 images a day, on 4 AA batteries.     <P>
Veggie imaging SVT will take place during the Veg04/05 experiment.  Due to the light spectrum applied in Veggie, filter selection is still ongoing. However, early testing in Veggie has shown multiple possibilities of filters to be used. During the SVT experiment, we will finalize filter selection and determine hardware mount for the imager. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This project brings established research from NASA funded science on the International Space Station (ISS) into an international project led by DLR (German Space Agency) toward the functionalization of plant growth in support of human exploration. Imaging technologies developed as part of ongoing ISS science will be deployed within the Antarctic EDEN ISS plant production unit to provide tele-science support and plant science analytics to better understand the responses of plants, and production support to optimize plant performance.    <P>
Plant production for advanced life support within deep space and extraterrestrial colonies has long been an appreciated area of technology development. Indeed ISS science is now turning toward small scale plant production in space, and plant production units in extreme environments on Earth have proven the value of fresh food. However, there has as yet to be any integrated tests of plant production within space vehicle-like structures in extreme analog environments. To address this gap in knowledge, the EDEN ISS project by the DLR German space agency is designed to place an ISS-inspired module in the context of an established Antarctic station, drawing together for the first time structures and production units designed to space vehicle formats together with the challenges of an extreme and isolated environment. In keeping with the spirit and intent of the EDEN ISS project, the current proposal seeks to fund US participation, bringing plant imaging technologies developed, in part from extensive Shuttle and ISS plant growth experiments, into the science to be conducted within EDEN ISS. The area of fidelity to be addressed by this project is a series of science investigations designed to further planetary research in terrestrial extreme environments that may be analogous to those found on other planets.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project is constructing essential controlled environment agriculture technologies using both an International Standard Payload Rack cultivation system to relate to on-board ISS and cis-lunar deployments for crew food supplementation, and a Future Exploration Greenhouse that is designed with respect to future planetary bioregenerative life support system deployments. The overall physical facility, referred to as the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility, will provide realistic mass flow and will deploy to the highly-isolated Antarctic Neumayer Station III, operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute.    <P>
Among the technologies to be developed and deployed will be imagers designed by the University of Florida (UF) Principal Investigator (PI) team, through this proposed project, to monitor plant health within the Mobile Test Facility. Our major goal is to equip the plant growth systems with information-rich imaging such that plant health and basic science data can be reviewed by a large and integrated science backroom back on “Earth.” An additional goal is to optimize the conceptual connections between EDEN ISS and current ISS capabilities and operations. These two goals bring a directed focus to the project, connecting the planetary surface analog concepts to near term operations of ISS and potential cis-lunar habitats.    <P>
To accomplish these goals, spectral imaging of plants will be incorporated into typical data monitoring systems and operation of the project.

This proposal seeks to seize the opportunity for important imaging technology advancement and US participation within the multinational context of the EDEN ISS project.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project seeks to create a structurally and operationally realistic analog to a space station, vehicular, or planetary habitat plant growth module for life support. As such, the project falls under the purview of Space Exploration and Spaceport Technology Development (SESTD) in several subcategories: In-Situ Resource Utilization Technologies (in that EDEN is dedicated to local production of food for bioregenerative Advanced Life Support), Lunar and Mars Base/Settlement Technologies (in that we will be within a robust simulation of life support technologies), and also Advanced Sensors and Detectors (in that we will be developing imaging cameras for monitoring plant health within the facility). As a working production facility, EDEN ISS will provide fresh produce to Neumayer III overwintering crews. And in the process, the project will validate key plant growth system technologies and operational protocols for use on the ISS and within future planetary bioregenerative life support systems -- a key set of technologies for long duration spaceflight and planetary habitation.    <P>
The project also has the potential to substantially contribute to plant health monitoring technology in terrestrial environments. Protected agriculture (production greenhouses and other crop facilities that are environmentally controlled or where climate is ameliorated) is a rapidly growing field in a world with expanding needs for food, and expanding regions of marginal crop land. Robotic tending and monitoring approaches are being embraced as time and resources saving tactics, and the type of health monitoring we are employing at EDEN ISS will contribute to the sophisticate tool box being employed in this expanding technology. <P></td>

						There were three main developmental technology tasks for this project: NDVI photo calibration, camera /filter development, and EDEN greenhouse integration.  Each of these technology tasks were applied to develop a better understanding of the biology in the greenhouse.  An in-depth understanding of the NDVI process and equation is important to develop the technology for early detection of crop failure.   NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) traditionally uses light reflected in the red spectrum to compare to light reflected in the far-red spectrum. By installing a camera capable of this study, we are better able to predict crop health in the EDEN greenhouse.       <P>
While many different filters were tested, an NDVI-7 filter was selected for this project that was available from IRPro.  This filter allows NDVI photos to be created from a single image, as opposed to the traditional method of combining a red wavelength and a near infrared wavelength photo.  Photos created using the NDVI-7 filter on the GoPro camera were then processed using ImageJ and a Photo Monitoring Plug-in developed by Ned Horning for the Public Lab.  This plug-in uses the single image to create an NDVI image, by utilizing the blue wavelengths to serve as the traditional red (or white) light part of the equation and the red wavelengths to serve as the near infrared part of the equation NDVI=(NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red).  By using a filter that cuts most of the red light from reaching the photo sensor, it permits the red sensors to receive near infrared light, which can then be used in image creating.      <P>
In addition to the modified GoPro camera, the addition of the CamDo Blink system allowed us to take pictures on a selected schedule.  While powered with a USB cord, the only limiting part of the system is the space on the SD card (which could hold over 25,000 photos).  When CamDo activates the camera, it includes a small amount of code for scheduling and operations.  The activated code causes the GoPro to search for a local wireless network and then upload the photos using an FTP (File Transfer Protocol).  This allows for an autonomous data collection within the greenhouse.      <P>
The greenhouse integration also imposed the challenge to light spectrum differences.  While traditional NDVI photos are captured with the full range of sunlight, this full spectrum is rarely available within closed habits with artificial lighting.  When NDVI approaches are utilized within a greenhouse, the artificial spectrum must be adjusted to include the necessary wavelengths, and this past year (pre deployments) spent a substantial amount of time in calibrations and testing spectra.    <P>
After arrival in Antarctica, the PI team worked with the DLR EDEN ISS Team to prepare the FEG to activate growing systems and data collection systems. The UFSI cameras were installed in select locations to facilitate the eventual observation of a tall crop (tomato) and of a low, leafy crop (arugula or lettuce). The cameras were then calibrated for focus and image collection--first with graphic targets, and then with seedling plants. Also tested at this stage was the ability of the images to be downloaded to the server, and delivered to the UF laboratory for processing.    <P>
The two UF Imagers in the FEG (Future Exploration Greenhouse) capture photos twice a day.  During each image capture, the photos are uploaded to the local server in Antarctica.  These images are then transferred once a day to a server at DLR (German Space Agency in Bremerhaven), which is accessible over the internet.  Once a day UF programs download the most recent images to UF servers for analysis.    Images are received on a 24 hour delay from capture.  Images are then manually processed using ImageJ software.  NDVI images and graphs are uploaded for DLR access. The systems are working well; for example, returned images allowed us to detect an anomaly (which was later determined to be an error in the nutrient delivery system) before plant damage was visible to the naked eye, or the traditional monitoring cameras. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This project brings established research from NASA funded science on the International Space Station (ISS) into an international project led by DLR (German Space Agency) toward the functionalization of plant growth in support of human exploration. Imaging technologies developed as part of ongoing ISS science will be deployed within the Antarctic EDEN ISS plant production unit to provide tele-science support and plant science analytics to better understand the responses of plants, and production support to optimize plant performance.    <P>
Plant production for advanced life support within deep space and extraterrestrial colonies has long been an appreciated area of technology development. Indeed ISS science is now turning toward small scale plant production in space, and plant production units in extreme environments on Earth have proven the value of fresh food. However, there has as yet to be any integrated tests of plant production within space vehicle-like structures in extreme analog environments. To address this gap in knowledge, the EDEN ISS project by the DLR German space agency is designed to place an ISS-inspired module in the context of an established Antarctic station, drawing together for the first time structures and production units designed to space vehicle formats together with the challenges of an extreme and isolated environment. In keeping with the spirit and intent of the EDEN ISS project, the current proposal seeks to fund US participation, bringing plant imaging technologies developed, in part from extensive Shuttle and ISS plant growth experiments, into the science to be conducted within EDEN ISS. The area of fidelity to be addressed by this project is a series of science investigations designed to further planetary research in terrestrial extreme environments that may be analogous to those found on other planets.    <P>
The EDEN ISS project is constructing essential controlled environment agriculture technologies using both an International Standard Payload Rack cultivation system to relate to on-board ISS and cis-lunar deployments for crew food supplementation, and a Future Exploration Greenhouse that is designed with respect to future planetary bioregenerative life support system deployments. The overall physical facility, referred to as the EDEN ISS Mobile Test Facility, will provide realistic mass flow and will deploy to the highly-isolated Antarctic Neumayer Station III, operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute.    <P>
Among the technologies to be developed and deployed will be imagers designed by the University of Florida (UF) Principal Investigator (PI team), through this proposed project, to monitor plant health within the Mobile Test Facility. Our major goal is to equip the plant growth systems with information-rich imaging such that plant health and basic science data can be reviewed by a large and integrated science backroom back on “Earth.” An additional goal is to optimize the conceptual connections between EDEN ISS and current ISS capabilities and operations. These two goals bring a directed focus to the project, connecting the planetary surface analog concepts to near term operations of ISS and potential cis-lunar habitats.    <P>
To accomplish these goals, spectral imaging of plants will be incorporated into typical data monitoring systems and operation of the project. EDEN ISS, as a large multinational project, has an extensive Data Management Plan (DMP). The work proposed here will depend and draw upon the EDEN ISS DMP for the overall project data, and will specifically draw Mobile Test Facility (MTF) plant growth images and operations images as primary data for analysis and management by the UF team. The UF team will archive and make available all plant health images specific to our tasks via a separate project within the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). The technology is based on small, robust cameras that image wavelengths related to previous and future ISS hardware such that data from EDEN ISS will provide feed forward science for known and anticipated ISS and habitat plant growth hardware. <P></td>
