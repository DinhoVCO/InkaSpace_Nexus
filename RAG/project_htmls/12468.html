                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. Our research goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX CRS-12 (SpaceX-12) at the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in August 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/- 4 hours of splashdown, ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were sacrificed after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight. The flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to the control groups. Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed changes in biomarker expressions related to BRB integrity. Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.    <P>
Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/-4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.    <P>
Astronauts returning from spaceflight have experienced eye problems, which may decrease retinal performance and lead to long-term effects on visual acuity. This study leverages the collected data from spaceflown murine retinas that were treated with redox-active metalloporphyrin (BuOE) to mitigate spaceflight-induced changes and respective ground controls. 10-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown on SpaceX-24 (RR-18) to the ISS national lab, kept in low Earth orbit for 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. Our multi-omics analysis of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data generated from subsequent murine retina tissues uncovered genes, pathways, and epigenetic modifications consistent with the therapeutic potential of BuOE. From RNA-Seq analysis of spaceflown murine samples, the treatment group shows differentially expressed genes relative to saline controls that reached significance, and genes that are related to protection against cell oxidative damage and cellular response to organonitrogen compounds. Ranked fold-changes from the same contrast were used for gene set enrichment analysis, which showed biological processes reaching significance, including glutathione metabolic processes and cellular response to xenobiotic stimulus. The findings from this investigation have the potential to provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying conditions like Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) and assess the effectiveness of BuOE as a countermeasure for astronauts experiencing neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities, which can lead to long-term effects on visual acuity.     <P>
The physical demands of deep-space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, understanding this has the potential to guide strategies to mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight, or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected for DSP: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis 1 (CA), and Dentate Gyrus (DG). Because spaceflight is associated with increased oxidative stress, treatment with antioxidants has emerged as a potential strategy to attenuate the effects of spaceflight. We therefore treated a subset of the spaceflight and control mice with the superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), and performed DSP on them as well. Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) due to spaceflight in all four regions of frontal cortex, cortex, CA1, and DG, with CA having the highest number of DEGs. Each brain region showed a distinct transcriptomic response, while some DEGs were common to two or more regions. A pathway analysis revealed distinct pathways sensitive to oxidative stress, as well as metabolic pathways, to be enriched in each of the brain regions. These represent the first spatial gene expression profiles taken of rodents in space, and may help improve our understanding of brain region-specific susceptibility to spaceflight conditions.  Treatment with BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of DEGs, suggesting that BuOE may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage.    <P>
The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1g on the acute and late intraocular pressure (IOP) changes and function of the retina. To determine the extent to which an antioxidant protects against spaceflight environment-induced changes in the retina, the mice were administered weekly superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE) or saline treatments, before launch and during their stay aboard the ISS. Forty ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on SpaceX-24 over 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before launch, IOP was measured using a handheld tonometer, and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG).  ERG data was recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to a weak, diffuse, full-field flash of light. Within 20 hours after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before sacrifice. Subsets of mice will be measured after 6 months of the spaceflight for the re-adaptation study. There were significant increases in body weight for both habitat control and vivarium control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements (p<0.05). However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown.  The IOP measurements were similar between pre-and post-flight groups. There were no significant differences between BuOE-treated mice and saline controls. To assess the retinal function, we measured the amplitude of the scotopic ERG b-wave, which is primarily generated by ON-type bipolar cells.  Bipolar cells are the main neurons of the retina that carry signals from photoreceptors to ganglion cells.  These data indicate, for the first time, spaceflight conditions may induce bipolar cell damage and dysfunction.     <P>
It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel, digital color-coded barcode counting technology was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from the flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response was significantly downregulated. Here, we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on neuronal function. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						Astronauts returning from spaceflight have experienced eye problems, which may decrease retinal performance and lead to long-term effects on visual acuity. This study leverages the collected data from spaceflown murine retinas that were treated with redox-active metalloporphyrin (BuOE) to mitigate spaceflight-induced changes and respective ground controls. 10-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice (n=5 in each of BuOE treated and saline control groups for spaceflown and ground control samples) were flown on SpaceX-24 Rodent Research-18 (RR-18) to the International Space Station (ISS) national lab, kept in low Earth orbit for 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. Our multi-omics analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data, generated from subsequent murine retina tissues, uncovered genes, pathways, and epigenetic modifications consistent with therapeutic potential of BuOE. From RNA-Seq analysis of spaceflown murine samples, the treatment group show differentially expressed genes relative to saline controls that reached significance (adjusted p-value < 0.05) and included genes Gpx3 and Crhbp, which are related to protection against cell oxidative damage and cellular response to organonitrogen compounds. Ranked fold-changes from the same contrast were used for gene set enrichment analysis, which showed biological processes reaching significance (adjusted p-value < 0.05), including glutathione metabolic processes and cellular response to xenobiotic stimulus. RRBS data of the spaceflown murine samples found 139 hyper or hypo differentially methylated sites spread across chromosomes 1-19 (20% promoters, 21% exons, 43% introns | 20 CpG islands, 7 CpG shores) with a 10% methylation difference (q-value < 0.05). The findings from this investigation have the potential to provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying conditions like spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome and assess the effectiveness of BuOE as a countermeasure for astronauts experiencing neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities, which can lead to long-term effects on visual acuity.  <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-24 over 35 days and returned to Earth alive. The mice received weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE) before launch and during their stay aboard the ISS. Some of the mice from this return group were sent to Loma Linda University (LLU) to re-adapt to Earth’s gravity for 4 months. Mice from on-orbit dissection have been returned to LLU for tissue process. Tissue collection and data analysis is still actively ongoing. Fixed ocular and brain samples will be used for histochemical analysis for identifying biomarkers for oxidative stress, apoptosis, and blood-retina-barrier (BRB) function. Frozen retina and brain samples have been used for genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analysis. The intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were similar between pre-and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. Electroretinogram (ERG) data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased 39% and 32% by spaceflight respectively, compared to that of habitat ground controls.  The genomics study also showed from subsequent murine retina tissues many genes, pathways, and epigenetic modifications consistent with therapeutic potential of BuOE. Spaceflown murine BuOE treated samples show differentially expressed genes relative to saline controls that reached significance (adjusted p-value < 0.05) and included genes Gpx3 and Crhbp, which are related to protection against cell oxidative damage and cellular response to organonitrogen compounds. [Ed. Note: Per the Principal Investigator, four brain regions were selected for Digital Spatial Profiling: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis 1 (CA), and Dentate Gyrus (DG).] Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight, or grounded controls, also revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) due to spaceflight in all four regions, with CA having the highest number of DEGs. Each brain region showed a distinct transcriptomic response, while some DEGs were common to two or more regions. A pathway analysis revealed distinct pathways sensitive to oxidative stress, as well as metabolic pathways, to be enriched in each of the brain regions. The data indicate, for the first time, the spaceflight condition may induce bipolar cell damage and dysfunction. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						TASK DESCRIPTION    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function.    <P>
FINAL REPORT    <P>
The mice were launched on SpaceX-24 in December 2021 and a subset of the mice returned to Earth on January 24, 2022. The mice received weekly antioxidant or saline treatments during their stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS).  Some of the mice from this return group were sent to Loma Linda University to readapt to Earth’s gravity for 4 months. Tissue collection and data analysis is ongoing.  Fixed ocular and brain samples will be used for histochemical analysis for identifying biomarkers for oxidative stress, apoptosis, and blood-retina-barrier (BRB) function. Frozen retina and brain samples will be used for genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analysis.  Preliminary electroretinogram (ERG) data showed that amplitude of the B-wave elicited a light-invoked slow cornea-positive potential; the amplitude was significantly decreased by 21% and 16.5% by space flight compared to habitat ground controls in the saline and BuOE treated groups respectively (p<0.05). The data indicate, for the first time, space flight conditions may induce bipolar cell damage and dysfunction.    <P>
Our data will be presented at several national and international meetings. The data will also be presented at the upcoming American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) meeting. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						The health risk from space flight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects is a chief concern. More recently, it has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. One of the goal of the present study was to characterize the changes in the gene expression of neuroinflammation panel for inflammation, neuronal function, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue and to quantify circulating cytokines in the plasma after space flight. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission, Within 38+4 hours of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues and whole blood were collected for analysis. Habitat ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware cages. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the space flight mouse brain. The Neuroinflammation panel includes 757 genes covering the core pathways and processes that define neuroimmune interactions. A set of 52 differently expressed genes significantly (p<0.05) segregates the GC group from the flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight condition. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated in FLT compared to the GC mice. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was also observed.  Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to antiviral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Changes in circulating cytokine/chemokine expression were also measured in the plasma using Luminex assay. Levels of several cytokines/chemokines in the flight group were significantly altered (p<0.05) in the plasma compared to GC controls, including IL-12, IP-10, MCP-1 MIP-1a, and MIP-2. These data indicate that neuroinflammation and altered immune reactions may be closely associate with space flight–induced stress response and have an impact on the neurovascular function that may result in neurodegeneration.    <P>
We also have characterized the effects of space flight on oxidative damage in the mouse brain and its impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Quantitative assessment of brain tissue demonstrated that space flight caused an up to 2.2-fold increase in apoptosis in the hippocampus compared to the control groups. Immunohistochemical analysis of the mouse brain revealed a strong increase in expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight hippocampus compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BBB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). These results gave strong indication of a disturbance of the BBB integrity.  Quantitative proteomic analysis showed significant alterations in pathways responsible for mitochondrial function, neuronal structure, neurovascular integrity, protein/organelle transport and metabolism in the brain after space flight. Changes in pathways associated with adhesion and molecular remodeling were also documented.  These data indicate that long-term space flight may have pathological and functional consequences associated with neurovascular damage and late neurodegeneration. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						SpaceX-12 was launched at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 30-day mission on August 14, 2017. Nine week old male C57BL/6 mice (n=20) were flown on SpaceX-12 in NASA’s animal enclosure modules (AEMs). The animals then were returned to Loma Linda University (LLU) where they were sacrificed followed by dissections. Experiment with ground-based control groups have been completed in May, 2018.  Fixed ocular samples have been used for histochemical analysis for identifying biomarkers for oxidative stress, apoptosis, and blood-retina-barrier (BRB) function. Frozen retina samples are used for genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analysis.  Our data showed that flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There was also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term space flight.    <P>
Our study also showed that many proteins and pathways responsible for mitochondrial function, nervous system development, behavior, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism were significantly altered after space flight in the brain. Pathways associated with adhesion molecular remodeling were also significantly altered.  Our data demonstrate that exposure to the space flight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure, neurovascular integrity, and metabolic function.     <P>
The micro-CT analysis showed that the cross-section areas of the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and choroid layer thickness were changed in space flight samples compared to ground controls (GC), with space flight samples showing significantly thinner cross-sections and layers compared to controls. The findings from this study indicate that micro-CT evaluation is a sensitive and reliable method to characterize ocular structure changes. These results are expected to improve the understanding of the impact of environmental stress on global ocular structures. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of space flight and reentry to 1g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye.  To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after space flight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38+/-4 hours of splashdown, mice were sacrificed and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages, respectively.      <P>
Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were sacrificed after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4-19.3 mmHg vs 16.3-20.3 mmHg) (p<0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term space flight.    <P>
Mice ocular tissues were also collected for genomics analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in space flight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal thickness, retinal pigment epithelium and choroid layer thickness, were significantly lower after space flight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of space flight and cause visual impairment.    <P>
A hematology analyzer was used to quantify white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), and platelet (PLT) parameters in space flight mice compared to ground controls. While there was no significant difference in overall WBC counts in flight compared to ground control mice, there was a significant decrease (P<0.05) in lymphocyte (LYM) counts as well as a significant increase (P<0.05) in granulocytes (GRA) in flight mice. Furthermore, there was a significant shift (P<0.05) in WBC populations away from LYM and towards monocytes (MON) and GRA, suggesting that space flight alters immune function. Additionally, RBC mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was significantly decreased (P<0.05) after space flight, which also significantly increased (P<0.05) RBC distribution width (RDW). These disruptions in erythrocyte populations may indicate space flight-induced anemia. PLT counts were also significantly lower (P<0.001) compared to ground controls, while mean PLT volume (MPV) significantly increased (P<0.05). This could also be an indication of a change in cellular function due to space flight. These results indicate space flight dramatically alters circulating cell populations, which are sustained for at least 36 hours after splashdown. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

SpaceX-12 was launched at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 30-day mission on August 14, 2017. Nine week old male C57BL/6 mice (n=20) were flown on SpaceX-12 in NASA’s animal enclosure modules (AEMs). The animals then were returned to Loma Linda University (LLU) where they were subject to sacrifice followed by dissections. Experiment with ground-based control groups have been completed in May, 2018.  Fixed ocular samples are under sectioning for histochemical analysis for identifying  biomarkers for oxidative stress, apoptosis, and blood-retina-barrier (BRB) function. Frozen retina samples are prepared for genomics and metabolomics analysis.  Our preliminary data showed that space flight conditions, especially gravitational changes, may induce acute and short-term response in intraocular pressure (IOP), most likely due to a compensatory mechanism. Global ocular structures were also measured using MicroCT.  The cross section areas of retina pigment epithelium (RPE), retina, and choroid layer were significantly or trend lower than habitat and vivarium controls. Further investigation is needed to determine the consequences of the acute IOP changes on ocular structure and function. The data were presented at ISS R&D (Research & Development) and NASA Human Research Program Workshop, 2018.    <P>

"A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space shuttle or International Space Station (ISS) missions have reported a subjective change in their eyesight. A dozen or more had documented anatomical eye changes post mission. These visual functional and anatomical disturbances have been hypothesized to be related to increases in intraocular pressure (IOP). The purpose of present study is to evaluate acute IOP and global ocular structure changes following spaceflight compared to pre-flight and vivarium controls. SpaceX-12 was launched at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 34-day mission on August 14, 2017. Nine week old male C57BL/6 mice (n=20) were flown on SpaceX-12 in NASA’s animal enclosure modules (AEMs).  Repeated IOP measurements were performed before the flight launch. A handheld tonometer was used for conscious mouse IOP measurement without a local anesthetic. Within 36 hours of splash-down, the spaceflight group were re-measured before they were [sacrificed] for further analysis. Age-matched vivarium mice which were housed in regular cages with regular food and water were only measured once at time of [sacrifice]. Cross sections of ocular layer were also measured using MicroCT on fixed eye. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (16.3-17.7 mmHg vs 17.6-19.5 mmHg mmHg) (p<0.05); age-matched controls had the lowest IOP measurement (14.4-16.2 mmHg). Eye side differences in IOP were also detected. Right eyes had lower values than that of right eyes in all groups. The cross section areas of retina pigment epithelium (RPE), retina and choroid layer were significantly or trend lower than vivarium controls. The rebound tonometer was easy to use and accurately measured IOP in mice. Our study indicates that space flight conditions, especially gravitational changes, may induce acute and short-term response in IOP, most likely due to a compensatory mechanism. Further investigation is needed to determine the consequences of the acute IOP changes on ocular structure and function. Additional studies are also needed on long-term regulation of ocular hemodynamics on IOP following changes in gravitational forces."  <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the space flight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space shuttle or International Space Station (ISS) missions have reported a subjective change in their eyesight. A dozen or more had documented anatomical eye changes post mission. These visual functional and anatomical disturbances have been hypothesized to be related to increases in intraocular pressure (IOP). The purpose of present study is to evaluate acute IOP changes following spaceflight compared to pre-flight and vivarium controls. SpaceX-12 was launched at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 30-day mission on August 14, 2017. Nine week old male C57BL/6 mice (n=20) were flown on SpaceX-12 in NASA’s animal enclosure modules (AEMs).  Repeated IOP measurements were performed before the flight launch. A handheld tonometer was used for conscious mouse IOP measurement without a local anesthetic. Within 36 hours of splash-down, the space flight group were re-measured before they were sacrificed for further analysis. Age-matched vivarium mice which were housed in regular cages with regular food and water were only measured once at time of sacrifice. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (16.3-17.7 mmHg vs 17.6-19.5 mmHg mmHg) (p<0.05); age-matched controls had the lowest IOP measurement (14.4-16.2 mmHg). Eye side differences in IOP were also detected. Right eyes had lower values than that of right eyes in all groups. The rebound tonometer was easy to use and accurately measured IOP in mice. Our study indicates that space flight conditions, especially gravitational changes, may induce acute and short-term response in IOP, most likely due to a compensatory mechanism. Further investigation is needed to determine the consequences of the acute IOP changes on ocular structure and function. Additional studies are also needed on long-term regulation of ocular hemodynamics on IOP following changes in gravitational forces.  To facilitate collaboration with other funded Space Biology investigators, enhancing scientific productivity, Dr. Jeff Willey and I just started collaborative study to examine the combined effects of radiation exposure and unloading to retina.    <P>
Both microgravity encountered by astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on Earth have also shown deleterious physiological effects. The purpose of the present study was to characterize unloading and space radiation-induced deleterious changes on retina and retinal vasculature.To better understand the effects of space flight, we used a combination treatment designed to simulate both the radiation and low gravity aspects of space conditions. C57BL/6 mice (n=10/group) were irradiated whole body with a Varian 2100 SC medical LINAC at an accelerating potential of 10 MV. The dose rate of ~1 Gy/min will be used to minimize dose heterogeneity. Mice were hindlimb unloaded (HLU) using tail suspension apparatus for 25 days. On Day 5, subset of group were irradiated at doses ranging from 0 to 1Gy during tail suspension without anesthesia to simulate spaceflight radiation exposure during periods of HLU. At the end of 25 days of unloading, Mice were sacrificed and eyes were collected for histological and molecular analysis. The level of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein, an oxidative specific marker for lipid peroxidation, Apoptotic activity in retina and retinal endothelial cells were examined and quantified using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Two-way ANOVA indicated main effects for radiation (p<0.05), but a smaller influence of HLU. Radiation dose-dependent elevation of HNE level was noted in the retina after radiation-only compared to controls. Mice received 0.5 and 1Gy of radiation showed significant increase of HNE protein expression (p<0.05). The combination group of 0.5 Gy and HLU had the highest level of expression among all the groups, resulting in strong unloading radiation interaction (p<0.05).  Increases in the number of TUNEL positive cells were seen in radiation-only and radiation + HLU mice compared to control  (p<0.05). Our study revealed that exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation and simulated microgravity induced oxidative damage and apoptosis in the retina. The data provided the evidence that simulated space flight conditions induce oxidative damage that results in apoptosis in the retina. This data suggest that astronauts may be at increased risk for late retinal degeneration. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight. Our study will also lead to new information to understand the causes and possible treatments of similar Earth-based neurovascular-related diseases and retinal disorders and will point toward potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						Because our flight experiment has not been scheduled, we were provided the option of expanding our Definition Phase Research in order to initiate our studies. Definition phase of the study was just approved and funded in April.    <P>
To facilitate collaboration with other funded Space Biology investigators, enhancing scientific productivity, Dr. Jeff Willey and I just started collaborative study to examine the combined effects of radiation exposure and unloading to retina.    <P>
We will use 80 female C57BL/6 mice for the Definition Phase of Specific Aim 1) to define the relationships between space flight condition-induced oxidative stress in ROS expression, retinal vascular remodeling, and BRB function; and 2) to determine whether space flight condition-induced oxidative damage in retina is mediated through photoreceptor mitochondrial ROS production.     <P>
 Each group will include 10 mice. A group of 40 mice will receive hindlimb unloading (HLU) using our tail suspension apparati. An additional 40 mice will serve as full-weight bearing ambulatory controls.  On Day 5, half of the mice from each group will be irradiated during tail suspension without anesthesia using our published procedure to simulate space flight radiation exposure during periods of HLU. The high-energy radiation will be delivered with a Varian 2100 SC medical LINAC at an accelerating potential of 10 MV, which will minimize the depth-dependent dose fall off during exposure.  The dose rate of ~1 Gy/min will be used to minimize dose heterogeneity. Mice will then remain either HLU or ambulatory for the next 25 days, at which time the mice will be sacrificed. Left eye will fixed in 4% PFA and right eye will be frozen for analysis.  Approved Specific Aim, procedures, assays, and outcomes will be identical to the original proposal. Since this is an ongoing study, we currently have no data to present.    <P>
 An antioxidant metalloporphyrin will be used in this study to determine if it can protect against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function.  To gain insight into the tissue distribution as well as to provide data that would ensure proper dosing regimens, we will conduct ground-based comprehensive pharmacokinetic study. Collaborators have been contacted to discuss the experiment design for the ground-based study.  <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The eye is a unique organ because it is relatively unprotected and constantly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, background radiation, environmental chemicals, and physical abrasion. A recent report shows that more than 30% of the astronauts returning from space were diagnosed with eye problems that can cause headaches and blurry vision. Our Preliminary studies from mice that had been subjected to space flights showed that environmental conditions during space travel lead to oxidative stress and induce adverse microvessel remodeling in the retina. However, our knowledge about the pathophysiological process from adaptive response to irreversible oxidative damage in the retina during and after space flight exposure and the underlying cellular mechanism(s) of these disturbances is very limited and inconsistent.    <P>
The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of space flight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against space flight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function. The hypothesis will be tested in the specific aims with the spaceflight experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to that of ground-based groups using matured female mice. For flight studies, there will be two experiments over two flights, one for in-flight adaptation study on the ISS and one for studying re-adaptation after live animal return to Earth following long-term ISS mission. Selected groups of mice will be treated intraperitoneally with an antioxidant a week before launch and weekly during space flight. Animals will be sacrificed in orbit at 14 and 30 days after launch or 30 days and up to 6 months after return alive on Earth.    <P>
Together, our unique, integrative, and quantitative activities with advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) imaging techniques and retinal functional testing using visual electroretinography will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathways of space flight condition-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage on retinal BRB integrity, vascular remodeling, and retinal function. The data will provide unique criteria for risks of functional detriments associated with space flight.

						The objectives of this application are to characterize the impact of spaceflight on female mouse retinal vasculature and tissue remodeling and to study the role of mitochondria in regulating oxidative stress-induced cellular damage and cell-cell interactions in the function of blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Our study will also determine the extent to which an antioxidant metalloporphyrin protects against spaceflight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function.    <P>
Because our flight experiment has not been scheduled and major funding has not been initiated, we currently have no data to present. In the meantime, we have worked with Paula Dumars at Ames Research Center to update the Flight Experiment Requirements Document (ERD). I also attended a rodent user group meeting at NASA Ames Research Center to present a summary of my experiment. NASA presented the current flight status and plans for live animal return. We met with project leaders and investigators to discuss the flight research projects.     <P>
An antioxidant metalloporphyrin will be used in this study to determine if it can protect against spaceflight environment-induced changes in retinal neurovascular coupling and retinal function.  To gain insight into the tissue distribution as well as to provide data that would ensure proper dosing regimens, we will conduct ground-based comprehensive pharmacokinetic study. Collaborators have been contacted to discuss the experiment design for the  ground-based study. <P>
