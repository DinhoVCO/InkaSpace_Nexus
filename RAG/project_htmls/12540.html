                    <td colspan="3"> The GeneLab data repository is a powerful resource with which to dissect plant responses to spaceflight at the molecular and genetic level. The research in this GeneLab Innovation study has therefore sought to continue and extend our current analysis of the GeneLab plant science data through bioinformatics, experimental tests of predictions, and development of approaches to facilitate data exploration and rapid sharing of analytical tools. This work directly addresses Goal 1 of the Space Biology program by creating ‘new knowledge of how biological systems adapt to space.’ In addition, this research approaches some of GeneLab’s guiding questions as to how implementation of large scale dataset analyses can help produce new insights and hypotheses about the effects of spaceflight on biological systems.     <P>
Aim (1): We have been using informatics to ask how spaceflight alters the plant transcriptome and proteome using GeneLab data. We have then compared these changes to responses to other stresses and environments, (e.g., pathogen attack or oxidative stress) where large-scale, publicly available datasets have already been deposited outside of GeneLab. These datasets include responses to partial gravity and gravitropism-related transcriptomes. For example, our analysis of Arabidopsis data from the BRIC (Biological Research in Canisters), EMCS (European Modular Cultivation System), and APEX (Advanced Plant Experiment) experiments has revealed oxidative stress and hypoxia as major flight-related stresses and has targeted gene families ranging from heat-shock proteins to cell wall peroxidases as likely key players in this spaceflight response network. The more comprehensive analysis possible with the bioinformatic tools generated in this innovation study have greatly expanded the range of molecular mechanisms we can detect.     <P>
Aim (2): The second element of the work has been to take the genes defined from the bioinformatics in Aim 1 and test their function by using mutants in these genes and assessing their responses to a suite of phenotypic assays including: morphometric measurements of gravtiropic and clinostat growth in short and long-term hypoxia and flooding and mechanical stimulation. Inferences from these growth analyses have been compared to those revealed by quantitative PCR results of marker genes identified from the core spaceflight, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and gravitropism transcriptomic analyses.      <P>
Aim (3): GeneLab datasets also offer the opportunity to address the key challenge of facilitating exploration of these large, complex, and specialized datasets by non-specialists. We have developed a database/exploration environment, the TOAST (Test Of All Space Transcriptomes) database, aimed at increasing such accessibility for the non-specialist. This system uses the Qlik database management software and offers a highly interactive data visualization toolset that allows non-expert users to search across, and explore interconnections within, large and complex datasets. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is leading to benefits outside of the spaceflight arena at two levels: (1) tool development and (2) extension of basic knowledge of plant stress responses.     <P>
At the level of tool development, we have generated a large dataset exploration environment built around the Qlik data visualization toolset. This tool allows rapid comparison and exploration between large-scale ‘omics-level datasets, facilitating comparison between transcriptomics/gene expression data and then cross-comparisons to protein-level data such as proteomics analyses. Although focused on spaceflight data within GeneLab’s data repository, this architecture is applicable to wider experimental datasets. In parallel we have also been developing gas regulation chambers to allow analysis of plant growth and molecular phenotypes related to lowered oxygen availability. Although again focused on spaceflight-related events of lowered oxygen levels, these devices are also applicable to studying the effects of ground-based phenomena such as flooding effects on plant biology.    <P>
Our analyses of phenotypes has also extended basic understanding on plant responses to touch, low oxygen levels, and oxidative stress signaling on Earth. For example, we have been able to define an array of genes that when mutated alter responses to oxidative stress on Earth. Oxidative stress is a major element of stress signaling and resistance pathways and so this basic understanding is expanding our broad knowledge of how plants are able to respond to less than optimal environmental conditions. <P></td>

						Bioinformatics tool development:    <P>
We have developed, and now deployed, a database and exploration environment for mining the publicly available spaceflight plant biology data called the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptomes, or TOAST, database. This system is built around the Qlik data visualization software. Thus, we have imported all the GeneLab plant biology data alongside publicly available datasets from US, European, and Chinese researchers into the TOAST database. We have also imported publicly available datasets related to spaceflight-associated stresses including: oxidative stress, responses to growth on the clinostat or during magnetic levitation, and radiation exposure, to help make comparisons to the spaceflight datasets. We have applied a minimal requirement of 3 independent biological replicates for each study allowing for the calculation of statistical significance of any changes seen (P- and Q-values). This has meant the database covers a wide range of studies on Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.    <P>
The database was tested in a public beta-test over 2018-2019 leading to improvements in the user interface, increases in the stability and improvements in the sets of analytical tools available. The database is now in version 4.6 and is publicly available at  <a target="_blank" href="https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast">https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast</a>  . Alongside the database an online tutorial has been developed ( <a target="_blank" href="https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata">https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata</a>  ) to aid users in getting started with the system. A manuscript describing the use of the database has also been published in Frontiers in Plant Science.    <P>
Alongside the TOAST database, a Meta data app has also been deployed to allow a deeper analysis of the available plant spaceflight data. Thus, the meta data associated with each dataset within the TOAST database has been manually curated and imported into an allied Qlik-based database. This approach allows searching of the linked experimental elements such as growth hardware, type of spaceflight, and lighting system used to allow the user to ask which experiments share similar conditions, or to try to understand how the experiments they are analyzing are different. The metadata app is publicly available at:  <a target="_blank" href="https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata">https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata</a>  .    <P>
Mutant analyses:    <P>
An additional goal for this work has been to use phenotyping of mutants in the genes identified as showing strong links to spaceflight-related events from the TOAST-based analysis described above. This phenotyping is being used to ask how well TOAST generates reliable and testable hypotheses about plant responses to spaceflight. Gravitropism, reaction to hypoxia, and response to oxidative stress are all closely linked to spaceflight-related conditions due to spaceflight’s disruption in normal plant gravity signaling, reduced availability of oxygen from the lack of convective mixing of gasses in space, and high oxidative loads due to a general background of spaceflight-related stress. These responses have therefore been used to screen the mutants for phenotypes. Analysis using the TOAST database has identified a suite of genes related to oxidative stress such as Heat Shock Proteins (chaperones) and the ROS (reactive oxygen species) producing enzymes such as the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, or RBOHs as likely key players in spaceflight stress responses. Phenotyping mutants in these genes has revealed unexpected linkages to spaceflight-related stresses, such as a role for heat shock proteins in gravitropism and the RBOHs in a broad suite of spaceflight effects from flooding to mechanical responses.    <P>
TOAST as an educational tool:    <P>
In addition to a research discovery tool, the TOAST database has also been tested in the educational setting. For example, TOAST has been used in the classroom in Verona and Oregon High Schools in WI, where students went through the process of data analysis, gene discovery, and hypothesis generation. In addition, TOAST has been incorporated into an undergraduate class experience at Carthage College, a 4 year liberal arts college in WI. In collaboration with Dr. Andrea Henle, TOAST analyses were incorporated into her Astrobiology undergraduate class with the goal of leading the students through an authentic research experience, discovering new genes related to spaceflight response in Arabidopsis and then testing these hypotheses with gravitropism assays on mutants in the selected genes.    <P>
At UWisconsin-Madison, the Principal Investigator (PI) also maintains a “Collaboratory” where biology and engineering undergraduates and high school students come together to develop plant phenotyping equipment and other hardware relevant to our spaceflight-related work. There are generally 10-15 students working on various plant molecular and engineering projects related to space biology and GeneLab with a practical lab course called AstroBotanical Engineering being offered ~each semester. These students have been helping develop the TOAST database interface, using TOAST to analyze spaceflight and related plant datasets, and working on the phenotyping pipelines to test the predictions made through using the GeneLab analyses from the TOAST database. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The GeneLab data repository is a powerful resource with which to dissect plant responses to spaceflight at the molecular and genetic level. The research in this GeneLab Innovation study therefore seeks to continue and extend our current analysis of the GeneLab plant science data through bioinformatics, experimental tests of predictions, and development of approaches to facilitate data exploration and rapid sharing of analytical tools. This work directly addresses Goal 1 of the Space Biology program by creating ‘new knowledge of how biological systems adapt to space.’ In addition, this research approaches some of GeneLab’s guiding questions as to how implementation of large scale dataset analyses can help produce new insights and hypotheses about the effects of spaceflight on biological systems.     <P>
Aim (1): We are using informatics to ask how spaceflight alters the plant transcriptome and proteome using GeneLab data. We are then comparing these changes to responses to other stresses and environments, (e.g., pathogen attack or light stress) where large-scale, publicly available datasets have already been deposited outside of GeneLab. These datasets include responses to partial gravity and gravitropism-related transcriptomes. Integrating such analyses with allied data, such as QTL maps, will allow us to specifically ask how many of the spaceflight-linked changes may be mediated through altered gravity sensing and response. Our preliminary analysis of Arabidopsis data from BRICs (Biological Research in Canisters)16-20 has revealed oxidative stress and hypoxia as major flight-related stresses and has targeted gene families ranging from heat-shock proteins to cell wall peroxidases as likely key players in this spaceflight response network. The more comprehensive analysis being undertaken in this innovation study will greatly strengthen these initial findings and expand the range of molecular mechanisms we can detect.     <P>
Aim (2): The second element of the work is to take the genes defined from the informatics in Aim 1 and test their function by passing their mutants through a suite of phenotypic assays. Analyses includes morphometric measurements of gravtiropic, thigmotropic, and clinostat growth in addition to development in short and long-term hypoxia. These studies are being performed using automated image analysis tools such as RootNav, RootTrace, and custom R-Shiny apps that are highly compatible with rapid sharing of data and analyses via the cloud. Inferences from these growth analyses will be compared to those revealed by quantitative PCR results of marker genes identified from the core spaceflight, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and gravitropism transcriptomic analyses.      <P>
Aim (3): GeneLab datasets also offer the opportunity to address the key challenge of facilitating exploration of these large, complex, and specialized datasets by non-specialists. The Gilroy lab has a long-standing collaboration with iPlant/CyVerse and Cold Spring Harbor in the development of RNAseq analysis teaching tools such as the DNAsubway Green Line and the Cold Spring Harbor DNA learning center. Extending these approaches to the spectrum of GeneLab’s plant data will make a significant step towards promoting access and understanding. One further approach to increasing accessibility for the non-specialist that we are developing will be through an online Tableau or Qlik-based app. These tools build highly interactive data visualization that allows non-expert users to search across, and explore interconnections within, large and complex datasets. The initial data visualization tool we have developed contains all GeneLab Arabidopsis data but is designed to be capable of integrating with other datasets to greatly extend the reach of the GeneLab resources. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is leading to benefits outside of the spaceflight arena at two levels: (1) tool development and (2) extension of basic knowledge of plant stress responses.     <P>
At the level of tool development, we have generated a large dataset exploration environment built around the Qlik data visualization toolset. This tool allows rapid comparison and exploration between large-scale ‘omics-level datasets, facilitating comparison between transcriptomics/gene expression data and then cross-comparisons to protein-level data such as proteomics analyses. Although focused on spaceflight data within GeneLab’s data repository, this architecture is applicable to wider experimental datasets. In addition, we are developing 3-d printing technologies to rapidly build plant analysis stations with a focus on large parallel arrays of clinostats and imaging stations allowing phenotyping of gravity-related effects on plants. In parallel we have also been developing gas regulation chambers to allow analysis of plant growth and molecular phenotypes related to lowered oxygen availability. Although again focused on spaceflight-related events of lowered oxygen levels, these devices are also applicable to studying the effects of ground-based phenomena such as flooding effects on plant biology.    <P>
Our analyses of phenotypes has also extended basic understanding on plant responses to touch, low oxygen levels, and oxidative stress signaling on Earth. For example, we have been able to define an array of genes that when mutated alter responses to oxidative stress on Earth. Oxidative stress is a major element of stress signaling and resistance pathways and so this basic understanding is expanding our broad knowledge of how plants are able to respond to less than optimal environmental conditions. <P></td>

						We have developed, and now deployed, a data exploration environment for mining the GeneLab plant biology datasets and combining them with other available spaceflight ‘omics-level’ analyses using the Qlik data visualization system. We have imported all the GeneLab plant biology data alongside publicly available datasets from a range of researchers into a database built around the Qlik platform for data visualization. The system is named the Test Of All Space Transcriptomes, or TOAST, database. In parallel, we have imported publicly available datasets related to spaceflight-associated stresses including: hypoxia, oxidative stress, and radiation exposure to facilitate cross-referencing to the GeneLab datasets. The RNAseq datasets have been imported as raw data and reanalyzed using the Tuxedo pipeline to ensure uniformity in data structure and comparability. Opening a dataset allows interactive browsing of the transcriptome data and real-time filtering of genes on parameters such as significance of fold-changes induced in spaceflight and Gene Ontology annotations.    <P>
The database has been in public beta for the last year allowing us to improve the user interface, increase the coverage of plant biology datasets, and increase the stability and overall end user experience in line with suggestions from the beta-testing research and educational community.    <P>
A second major goal for this work is to use phenotyping of mutants in the plant genes identified as showing strong links to spaceflight-related events from the TOAST-based analysis described above. This phenotyping is being used to ask how well TOAST generates reliable and testable hypotheses about plant responses to spaceflight. Gravitropism, reaction to hypoxia, and response to oxidative stress are closely linked to spaceflight-related conditions due to spaceflight’s disruption in normal plant gravity signaling, reduced availability of oxygen from the lack of convective mixing of gasses in space, and high oxidative loads due to a general background of spaceflight-related stress. Analyses from the TOAST database have identified Heat Shock Proteins (molecular chaperones) and related genes such as the Bcl-2 associated athanogene family (BAG family of chaperone regulators) and cell wall peroxidases as likely key players in spaceflight stress responses. Phenotyping mutants in these genes is revealing a range of spaceflight-related phenotypes including some unexpected roles for the heat shock proteins in gravitropic response and the BAG genes in low oxygen stress responses.    <P>
In addition to a research discovery tool, we have also tested the TOAST database in the educational setting. For example, we have used TOAST at the Middle School level, where students went through gene discovery and hypothesis generation. Two of these students then stayed on to develop a major report on the bioinformatics they performed and are working with the lab to translate the in silico work to wet-lab based experimentation. In addition, we have incorporated TOAST into an undergraduate class experience at Carthage College, a 4 year liberal arts college in Wisconsin. In collaboration with Dr. Andrea Henle, TOAST analyses were incorporated into her Astrobiology undergraduate class with the goal of leading the students through an authentic research experience, discovering new genes related to spaceflight response in Arabidopsis.    <P>
We also maintain a “Collaboratory” where biology and engineering undergraduates and high school students come together to develop high throughput phenotyping equipment and other hardware relevant to our spaceflight-related work. Over 2017-2018 we have mentored approximately 10 independent study students working on various plant molecular and engineering projects related to space biology and GeneLab. We also run a space biology related practical lab course called AstroBotanical Engineering. Here a pool of plant biology and engineering students collaborate to develop space-related hardware for ground-based testing of plant science space-related projects. We have ~15 students per semester. These students are helping develop the phenotyping systems to test the predictions made through using the GeneLab analyses from the TOAST database. This year we have concentrated on space radiation-related changes and defining target genes for future radiation experiments.    <P>
During 2017-2018, we have presented GeneLab-related research at the 2018 MidWest Plant Cell Dynamics Meeting, the annual meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, and the American Society of Plant Biologists, and at international venues such as the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. GeneLab analyses are also key elements of our local outreach efforts, where we have presented this work at events ranging from University of Wisconsin sponsored outreach days (e.g., UW’s Science Saturdays and Science Expeditions) to presentations for high school students and undergraduates (e.g., BioHouse) and K-12 teachers (Biotechnology Institute summer training program), and are now hosting a BTI intern for the coming year to work on space transcriptome work. GeneLab analyses are also integral to a middle/high school ‘field trip’ as part of a collaboration with the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery called “plants and robots.” Here ~15-20 students are introduced to plant space science and then program a robotics imaging platform to perform plant gravitropism assays. We support 10-20 of these field trips over the year.    <P>
We also maintain a popular science outreach site called Astrobotany.com ( <a target="_blank" href="https://astrobotany.com/">https://astrobotany.com/</a>  ) that promotes the latest in space-related plant biology. Astrobotany.com also hosts a tutorial for TOAST and acts as one portal to the TOAST database.    <P>
We are also working closely with a game development studio at the Wisconsin Center for Education Research within the University of Wisconsin to develop an educational video game built around colonizing Mars. We are using the GeneLab datasets as the background data driving the plant biology aspects of the game. This is currently in the initial stages of development and we are engaging the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County to bring in a cohort of students to help develop concepts and initial programming for the game.    <P>
In addition, we have presented this work at a range of outreach event such as Science on Tap and at Madison’s Space Place, where the talk was recorded for release through Wisconsin Public Television. We have had the opportunity to extend the impact of the work with some national radio exposure, such as WPR’s Central Time and NPR’s Science Friday and on The Big Ten TV network. We have combined these national efforts with international outreach, such as lab members working with Seva Chakkara, an orphanage of ~100 children in India. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The GeneLab data repository is a powerful resource with which to dissect plant responses to spaceflight at the molecular and genetic level. The research in this GeneLab Innovation study therefore seeks to continue and extend our current analysis of the GeneLab plant science data through bioinformatics, experimental tests of predictions, and development of approaches to facilitate data exploration and rapid sharing of analytical tools. This work directly addresses Goal 1 of the Space Biology program by creating ‘new knowledge of how biological systems adapt to space.’ In addition, this research approaches some of GeneLab’s guiding questions as to how implementation of large scale dataset analyses can help produce new insights and hypotheses about the effects of spaceflight on biological systems.     <P>
Aim (1): We are using informatics to ask how spaceflight alters the plant transcriptome and proteome using GeneLab data. We are then comparing these changes to responses to other stresses and environments, (e.g., pathogen attack or light stress) where large-scale, publicly available datasets have already been deposited outside of GeneLab. These datasets include responses to partial gravity and gravitropism-related transcriptomes. Integrating such analyses with allied data, such as QTL maps, will allow us to specifically ask how many of the spaceflight-linked changes may be mediated through altered gravity sensing and response. Our preliminary analysis of Arabidopsis data from BRICs (Biological Research in Canisters)16-20 has revealed oxidative stress and hypoxia as major flight-related stresses and has targeted gene families ranging from heat-shock proteins to cell wall peroxidases as likely key players in this spaceflight response network. The more comprehensive analysis being undertaken in this innovation study will greatly strengthen these initial findings and expand the range of molecular mechanisms we can detect.     <P>
Aim (2): The second element of the work is to take the genes defined from the informatics in Aim 1 and test their function by passing their mutants through a suite of phenotypic assays. Analyses includes morphometric measurements of gravtiropic, thigmotropic, and clinostat growth in addition to development in short and long-term hypoxia. These studies are being performed using automated image analysis tools such as RootNav, RootTrace, and custom R-Shiny apps that are highly compatible with rapid sharing of data and analyses via the cloud. Inferences from these growth analyses will be compared to those revealed by quantitative PCR results of marker genes identified from the core spaceflight, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and gravitropism transcriptomic analyses.      <P>
Aim (3): GeneLab datasets also offer the opportunity to address the key challenge of facilitating exploration of these large, complex and specialized datasets by non-specialists. The Gilroy lab has a long-standing collaboration with iPlant/CyVerse and Cold Spring Harbor in the development of RNAseq analysis teaching tools such as the DNAsubway Green Line and the Cold Spring Harbor DNA learning center. Extending these approaches to the spectrum of GeneLab’s plant data will make a significant step towards promoting access and understanding. One further approach to increasing accessibility for the non-specialist that we are developing will be through an online Tableau or Qlik-based app. These tools build highly interactive data visualization that allows non-expert users to search across, and explore interconnections within, large and complex datasets. The initial data visualization tool we have developed contains all GeneLab Arabidopsis data but is designed to be capable of integrating with other datasets to greatly extend the reach of the GeneLab resources. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is leading to benefits outside of the spaceflight arena at two levels: (1) tool development and (2) extension of basic knowledge of plant stress responses.     <P>
At the level of tool development, we have generated a large dataset exploration environment built around the Qlik data visualization toolset. This tool allows rapid comparison and exploration between large-scale ‘omics-level datasets, facilitating comparison between transcriptomics/gene expression data and then cross-comparisons to protein-level data such as proteomics analyses. Although focused on spaceflight data within GeneLab’s data repository, this architecture is applicable to wider experimental datasets. In addition, we are developing 3-d printing technologies to rapidly build plant analysis stations with a focus on large parallel arrays of clinostats and imaging stations allowing phenotyping of gravity-related effects on plants. In parallel we have also been developing gas regulation chambers to allow analysis of plant growth and molecular phenotypes related to lowered oxygen availability. Although again focused on spaceflight-related events of lowered oxygen levels, these devices are also applicable to studying the effects of ground-based phenomena such as flooding effects on plant biology.    <P>
Our analyses of phenotypes has also extended basic understanding on plant responses to touch, low oxygen levels, and oxidative stress signaling on Earth. For example, we have been able to define an array of genes that when mutated alter responses to oxidative stress on Earth. Oxidative stress is a major element of stress signaling and resistance pathways and so this basic understanding is expanding our broad knowledge of how plants are able to respond to less than optimal environmental conditions. <P></td>

						The major goals undertaken in this first year of the research have been to: (1) Develop a database and coupled exploration environment capable of allowing rapid exploration of the GeneLab data repository’s plant science data and (2) Develop phenotyping systems to handle a relatively high throughput of plant lines to allow testing of the prediction arising from the data exploration. Progress has been made on both fronts as described below.    <P>
Database: We have developed an interactive data exploration environment based on the Qlik engine that allows rapid and transparent comparison and analysis of data drawn from the GeneLab data repository. The backend database driving the analysis environment is at present focused on GeneLab’s plant biology data. The raw data has been imported, reanalyzed using a standard approach across all gene expression datasets (transcriptomics data) and across all protein level analysis (proteomic data) to allow for valid comparisons. A graphical front end has then been developed to allow non-specialists to browse and analyze the datasets. The database also incorporates metadata to allow analyses to be driven in part by the kinds of experimentation and data generated and also provides links to the primary literature (where possible) to allow users to seamlessly compare their analysis to the published analyses of the same datasets. The environment has completed alpha testing and is now undergoing beta testing across several universities. A large-scale server stress test and gathering of associated user feedback is to be conducted over a few weeks in October/November 2017 to assess accessibility requirements prior to a broader public release of the initial environment. During this release of version 1, increased functionality related to incorporating other organisms into the backend database is anticipated with updates throughout the coming year as new functionality becomes available.    <P>
Devices: A major limitation exists to capitalizing on the insights drawn from the kinds of data analysis outlined above. These bioinformatics-driven analyses focus in on potentially important genes for spaceflight response that will then be tested with experiments aimed at revealing the function of these targeted genes. These experiments revolve around making mutant lines of plants where these target genes have been deleted, and then using growth and molecular analyses to ask how these plants are now different. The mutant production pipeline is well established but the devices to allow growth and molecular analyses under conditions related to spaceflight are generally of very limited availability and can process very few lines at a time.    <P>
We have therefore been working with a series of engineering students to develop more accessible devices to make these measurements on many plant lines simultaneously. We have focused on clinostats and chambers to impose altered oxygen levels as these are both poorly available technologies and directly relate to spaceflight-related stresses. The clinostat randomizes the direction of gravity, allowing analysis of effects decoupled from a coherent gravity vector. Hypoxic chambers allow the limited oxygen supply associated with spaceflight to be mimicked. Thus, hypoxia is thought to develop around respiring tissues in spaceflight as the lack of buoyancy-driven convection in microgravity limits the mixing of gasses (oxygen) around organisms. We have developed a 3-d printing approach to rapidly prototype and build devices and combined these designs with minicomputer controllers to allow precise regulation of clinostat rotation of oxygen flow for the chamber systems. These devices are in the final testing and deployment phase before a more large-scale production to support the large parallel experiment approach described above. We are already using the prototypes of these systems as a proof-of-concept that this rapid prototyping/build approach is viable to make the equipment needed to support a larger throughput of plant mutant analyses required for this research. This effort is now aimed at integrating the hypoxia chambers and clinostats to provide a unique tool to study the combined effect of these two stresses (no coherent gravity direction and low oxygen stress) as a tool for space science researchers.    <P>
As part of this genetic analysis/device production strategy for capitalizing upon GeneLab data we have been able to recruit a large cohort of ~25-30 undergraduate students with approximately half having principle interests in biology and half being engineers. These students are intimately involved in device design, prototyping, and development, and in the biological analysis of the mutant plant lines. These experiences are supported through a variety of academic channels through the laboratory including volunteers, students researching as part of their in-lab independent study at the university and also as part of a class we have initiated at the University of Wisconsin called Astro-Botanical Engineering, which is focused on this blending of biological plant research with the development of novel engineering solutions to test the relevant biological hypotheses about spaceflight responses. We are extending these kinds of studies to collaborative educational efforts towards plant space biology, e.g., we have a developing collaboration with Carthage College on using this approach with their new Astrobiology class. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The GeneLab data repository is a powerful resource with which to dissect plant responses to spaceflight at the molecular and genetic level. The research in this proposed GeneLab Innovation study therefore seeks to continue and extend our current analysis of the GeneLab plant science data through bioinformatics, experimental tests of predictions and development of approaches to facilitate data exploration and rapid sharing of analytical tools. This work directly addresses Goal 1 of the Space Biology program by creating ‘new knowledge of how biological systems adapt to space’. In addition, this research approaches some of GeneLab’s guiding questions as to how implementation of large scale dataset analyses can help produce new insights and hypotheses about the effects of spaceflight on biological systems.     <P>
Aim (1): We propose to use informatics to ask how spaceflight alters the plant transcriptome and proteome using GeneLab data. We will then compare these changes to responses to other stresses and environments, (e.g., pathogen attack or light stress) where large-scale, publicly available datasets have already been deposited outside of GeneLab. These datasets include responses to partial gravity and gravitropism-related transcriptomes. Integrating such analyses with allied data, such as QTL maps, will allow us to specifically ask how many of the spaceflight-linked changes may be mediated through altered gravity sensing and response. Our preliminary analysis of Arabidopsis data from BRICs (Biological Research in Canisters)16-20 has revealed oxidative stress and hypoxia as major flight-related stresses and has targeted gene families ranging from heat-shock proteins to cell wall peroxidases as likely key players in this spaceflight response network. The more comprehensive proposed analysis will greatly strengthen these initial findings and expand the range of molecular mechanisms we can detect.     <P>
Aim (2): The second element of the proposed work will take the genes defined from the informatics in Aim 1 and test their function by passing their mutants through a suite of phenotypic assays. Analyses will include morphometric measurements of gravtiropic, thigmotropic, and clinostat growth in addition to development in short and long-term hypoxia. These studies will be performed using automated image analysis tools such as RootNav, RootTrace, and custom R-Shiny apps that are highly compatible with rapid sharing of data and analyses via the cloud. Inferences from these growth analyses will be compared to those revealed by quantitative PCR results of marker genes identified from the core spaceflight, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and gravitropism transcriptomic analyses.      <P>
Aim (3): GeneLab datasets also offer the opportunity to address the key challenge of facilitating exploration of these large, complex and specialized datasets by non-specialists. The Gilroy lab has a long-standing collaboration with iPlant/CyVerse and Cold Spring Harbor in the development of RNAseq analysis teaching tools such as the DNAsubway Green Line and the Cold Spring Harbor DNA learning center. Extending these approaches to the spectrum of GeneLab’s plant data will make a significant step towards promoting access and understanding. One further approach to increasing accessibility for the non-specialist that we propose to develop will be through an online Tableau or Qlik-based app. These tools can build highly interactive data visualization that allows non-expert users to search across, and explore interconnections within, large and complex datasets. The initial data visualization tool we develop will contain all GeneLab Arabidopsis data but will be designed to be capable of integrating with other datasets to greatly extend the reach of the GeneLab resources. <P></td>
