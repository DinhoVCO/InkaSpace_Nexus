                    <td colspan="3"> The goal of the proposed work is to determine the effects of space flight on growth, performance (productivity and time to maturation), metabolism, and genetic changes in radish plants (Raphanus sativus). Plants will be grown in the ADVANCED PLANT HABITAT (APH) hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and in comparable experiments in ground controls. The research conforms to NASA’s top future goal of long-term space exploration and terraforming other planets and satellites. These goals depend on nutritionally valuable food crops that can be reliably grown in an environment that is not only defined by altered gravity or weightless environment but also different atmospheric conditions. In contrast to studying direct effects of gravity on plants, our approach focuses on secondary, derived conditions such as altered convection, transpiration, watering conditions, CO2, other gaseous components, and LED illumination, which creates a characteristic energy (heat and light) gradient within the growth volume.    <P>
Radishes are good candidate plants to grow on the ISS because they mature quickly (harvest after = 28 days after planting), have been grown successfully on the ISS (Massa et al., 2013); genetic and metabolic information is readily available (Shen et al., 2013); and they are nutritionally desirable and provide a wealth of information that can thoroughly be analyzed by biochemical, physiological, and genetic approaches. Radishes are good sources of minerals (especially K, Ca, Fe, and Zn), complex carbohydrates, vitamin C, dietary fibers, folic acid (vitamin B9), anthocyanins, and glucosinolates, a class of secondary metabolites characteristic for Brassicaceae. In addition to their roots, certain varieties of radish are used for their leaves, siliques, and oil. The nutritional value and versatility of these vegetables makes them good candidates as a crop plant for astronauts. The small seed size (<4 mm), longevity of seeds (up to five years), small plant size, and the ability to consume the entire plant makes radishes ideally suited for space biology.    <P>
Previous studies have focused on the effect of gravity and shown that space conditions allow successful cultivation of Brassica species (Musgrave et al., 2000). However, the quality, biomass, sensitivity of growth to day length, and (constant) temperature are important parameters for this species that have yet to be studied, especially in light of results that seed development in space cultures was compromised (Kuang et al., 2005), especially when oxygen was limited (Kuang et al., 1998). Equally unknown is the effect of environmental conditions in spacecrafts on the performance of plants. Understandably, the emphasis on space biology focuses on the effect of weightlessness and gravity on plant orientation and mechanical properties (Hoson 1999). However, conditions that are the consequence of weightlessness, e.g., lack of convection or altered atmosphere, are equally significant but unknown.    <P>
Our proposal intends to measure the metabolic, physiological, and genetic responses of radishes grown on the ISS and identify the effect of the space environment on metabolite accumulation, flavor, enzyme activity, mineral uptake, and generation time. This knowledge will be essential for the transition from Earth-bound cultivation of plants to growth conditions in space; the research is important for the establishment of human colonies on the Moon, Mars, and farther outposts.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The objective to grow plants under space conditions requires optimization of auxiliary parameters such as light intensity, quality, watering, substrate definition, fertilization that all have immediate implications for more efficient agricultural practices. The data that we will obtain examine much more than simple yield (mass) of the plants but include the mineral content, propensity to flower, flavor components, and water use. All attempts will not only optimize plant culture under elevated CO2, limited water, and controlled fertilizer provision, but also investigate the genetic responses of plants to mitigate space (or agricultural) stress. The overall result of the project will therefore benefit our generic understanding of factors that control plant growth and productivity in space and on Earth. <P></td>

						Progress Report for NASA Grant 80NSSC17K0344  Principal Investigator: Dr. Karl H. Hasenstein   Period covered by the report: 7/2021 – 10/2022   Name and address of the recipient’s institution:   University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette LA 70504   Award number: 80NSSC17K0344   December 5, 2022      Objectives:   	Germinate seeds and support plant growth for extended cultivation.   	Control growth and provide adequate water and fertilization.   	Assessment of variances of plant growth in space and in ground controls.   	Crew handling aspects of the NASA Advanced Plant Habitat/APH (planting, sampling & harvesting).     <P>
The space experiment (APH2):  The objective of the space flight experiment was to assess crop plant performance in space and analyze the effect of weightlessness, elevated CO2, specific light conditions, and artificial substrate on plant growth, productivity, and changes in gene expression, which was assessed by RNA-sequencing of the space experiments, NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ground control with elevated CO2, and lab control with ambient CO2.     <P>
The preparations for the flight experiments were completed and the prepared (seeded) science carrier launched on the Cygnus 14 flight on 10/2/20. The first experiment was initiated on November 3 and completed by 11/30 2020. The second grow-out started 12/1 and was completed 12/30/2020. Sample return occurred in two batches. The first half of material was returned May 2nd and received at the University of Louisiana (UL) on June 2nd. The second half of the material was returned on SpaceX 22 on July 9, 2021. The previous report described space and control growth results; this report focuses on the content analyses and RNA-seq data.    <P>
Plant productivity:   The leaf area per quadrant for the first ISS experiment compared well with previous grow-outs (EVT and ? EVT). The weight determinations for the radish bulbs showed an increasing trend but no statistically different values for the space and ground controls. The ambient conditions at the PI lab (gas-chromatography / GC-UL) showed the largest leaf area. The bulb mass showed a similar trend as the leaf area but was not significantly different between any of the samples.    <P>
The relationship between elevated CO2 indicated a stronger correlation between leaf area and bulb mass than for the ambient CO2 concentration. Elevated CO2 may lead to greater leaf area but not higher bulb mass.     <P>
Although without apparent effect on plant productivity, a comparison between the water consumption in space and KSC ground control illustrated the effect of weightlessness on the water distribution in the growth substrate. The difference between the top and bottom moisture sensors was apparent for the ground control but not for space data. The early growth period was characterized by low water consumption. As expected, the water demand increased with leaf growth. Larger fluctuations during the last week indicate strain for the water delivery system.    <P>
Nutritional values:  A major element of the proposed work was an assessment of the nutritional value of space grown plant material. We examined the amount of protein and minerals in leaves and bulbs of radishes under space and ground conditions. Similar to the leaf area and bulb mass data, there were no significant differences between space and ground-grown plants or elevated and ambient CO2 concentration. As had been shown previously, the leaf material had higher protein and mineral content compared with the bulbs. Protein was determined as nitrogen using a conversion factor of 6.25 between N and protein. The mineral content showed higher values for leaves than bulbs and the spectrum of minerals between ground controls and space experiments were not significant.    <P>
Assessment of photosynthetic efficiency:  Instead of using a hand-held fluorimeter to collect spot samples, an indirect measurement was implemented that evaluated the photosynthetic activity by calculating the Normalized Differential Vegetative Index (NDVI), which relies on the difference between leaf reflectivity at 750 nm and 650 nm.   NDVI = (R750 - R650)/(R750 + R650).    <P>
The measurements were possible without touching, and therefore resulted in no damage to the leaves. Since the available infrared (IR) camera only allows images from the rear of the APH, no information from plants in the front of the APH could be obtained. The NDVI data showed a decrease in photosynthetic performance for all conditions and may at least partially be related to the increased sampling of older leaves as the plants matured. Although NDVI assessment does not provide the same information as a specific fluorescence-based system, reduced crew time and the non-invasive nature of reflective measurements justified a lower precision data acquisition. Healthy NDVI assessments of photosynthesis results in values = 80 %; it is possible that the steady decline was linked with the appearance of necrotic tissue along the rim of most leaves.    <P>
qPCR analyses of leaf punch samples:  The experimental protocol included sampling of leaf tissue at day 10, 18, and 24 of the 27 day grow-out. These samples were intended to assess the temporal variation of relevant genes in leaf tissue. The samples were collected by astronauts and stored in microfuge tubes at -80°C until processing. The storage time for the ground control and space samples were similar (about six months), but differed between samples from the first and second grow-out on the ISS. The quantified genes included Napin Storage Protein (RSN), Peroxidase Precursor (RPP), Glucosinolate Synthase (GIS), Chlorophyll Binding Protein (CBP), and Raphanus myrosinase (RMA). The expression level of these genes was evaluated against the reference genes Actin-7 and Ubiquitin-1. Although the general profile of these genes is similar, the ground control had the highest myrosinase levels. The transcription was reduced during initial bulb formation (day 18) but recovers by day 24, three days before harvest. In contrast, samples from ISS1 show a steady decline in myrosinase. These data confirm that gene expression does change during the growth period and that leaf punch data can serve the intended purpose, namely evaluating plant health, culture conformity, and comparisons between different growth conditions.    <P>
Comparison between tissue extraction and Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE):  The second ISS grow-out included a test for a simplified genetic sampling method and comparing it with the ground control. SPGE is based on oligo-dT-functionalized probes that upon insertion into tissue extract mRNA based on the hybridization between the oligo-dA tail that is characteristic for mRNA and the oligo-dT layer of the SPGE probe. Although the extraction material is best processed immediately after extraction, preliminary tests showed that the mRNA remains intact for 16 weeks, less than the required storage at -80°C. Despite these uncertainties, SPGE extraction resembled the quantification from leaf punch samples from ISS2 grow-out and ground control. This observation validates SPGE as efficient, fast, and reliable extraction method.     <P>
RNA-seq evaluation:  The overall assessment of differences between space conditions and CO2 effects required three comparisons, a space experiment at predetermined (2500 ppm CO2), a ground control at the same CO2 concentration, and a ground control at ambient (~400 ppm CO2). RNA-seq also allowed for a comparison between the first and second grow-out on the ISS. Sequencing relied on space material (bulb and leaves, 4 replicates each); KSC (= ground control, bulbs, and leaves, 3 replicates each); and UL control (bulbs and leaves, 3 reps each).     <P>
28 samples were extracted and sequenced (Novogene, 8801 Folsom Blvd, Sacramento, CA 9582) on an Illumina system resulting in paired end reads of 150 bp.     <P>
Reference genome and gene model annotation files were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website:( <a target="_blank" href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/plant/Raphanus_sativus/all_assembly_versions/GCF_000801105.1_Rs1.0/">https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/plant/Raphanus_sativus/all_assembly_versions/GCF_000801105.1_Rs1.0/</a>  )  Alignment to the reference genome was done using Hisat2 v2.0.5. The mapped reads of each sample were assembled by StringTie (v1.3.3b) and full-length transcripts with multiple splice variants quantified for each gene locus with featureCounts (v.1.5.0). Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced (FPKM) of each gene was calculated for each gene.    <P>
The DESeq2 R-package (1.20.0) was used for determining differential expression. The resulting P-values were adjusted with Benjamini and Hochberg's method. Genes with an adjusted P-value of <=0.05 were assumed to be differentially expressed. Adjusted p-values multiplied by ln(2) transformed expression values were used to obtain a combined, linearized parameter that estimates significant changes between treatments. A correlation analysis verified sample reliability and repeatability of the experiment.   A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the FPKM values of all samples and showed strong segregation of leaf and bulb data. Separation between treatments clustered leaves into three distinct groups, Space, Ground control with elevated, and ambient CO2.     <P>
The Correlation and PCA analyses were further corroborated by the examining the overall gene counts that are differentially expressed under different experimental conditions.     <P>
Differentially expressed gene counts show reduced diversity between the first and second ISS grow-outs and greater variability between leaf material, and under different CO2 conditions Up regulation occurred as often as down regulation.    <P>
Differentially expressed transcripts of down- and up-regulated genes were considered for pathway analyses if they resulted in more than two-fold difference and a p-value of <0.05. Data of higher stringency (more than five-fold down or up-regulated and p <0.001) were used to identify affected enzymes.    <P>
The number of altered genes under similar conditions (i.e., first and second ISS grow-out) can further provide a base value of gene variability without space or stress-related responses. This variability is higher in leaves than in bulbs, and by the time of harvest ranges from about 34 genes for bulbs and 158 genes for leaves. Further work will try to identify an associated error range for these estimates.    <P>
The larger contribution of CO2 effects as primary factor indicates that atmospheric conditions, including airflow, play an important role for plant growth experiments. Future experiments should study different gas concentrations to develop a comprehensive data set on plant susceptibility to pressure, temperature, and partial pressure of included gases.     <P>
d13C analysis:  An attempt was made to measure the isotope fractionation in space-grown plants. d13C‰= [(13C/12C sample)/(13C/12C Std)-1]x1000. We determined the d13C value for ISS (1&2) and ground control samples. The data showed large differences between all conditions and the values deviated from the standard value for C3 plants (-30‰)The shift (likely based on the type of CO2 compression) made the attempted analysis unreliable as the 13C value of the utilized CO2 was not known.    <P>
Summary:  The space experiment APH2 was successfully completed, and most of the analytical work accomplished. The main conclusions are that radishes can grow well in space, have similar productivity as on Earth, and respond to elevated CO2 more than to weightlessness. RNA-seq analyses identify photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism as major affected pathways. The rich data sets will be published, and the sequencing data be deposited into NASA’s GeneLab database.  <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The goal of the proposed work is to determine the effects of space flight on growth, performance (productivity and time to maturation), metabolism, and genetic changes in radish plants (Raphanus sativus). Plants will be grown in the ADVANCED PLANT HABITAT (APH) hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and in comparable experiments in ground controls. The research conforms to NASA’s top future goal of long-term space exploration and terraforming other planets and satellites. These goals depend on nutritionally valuable food crops that can be reliably grown in an environment that is not only defined by altered gravity or weightless environment but also different atmospheric conditions. In contrast to studying direct effects of gravity on plants, our approach focuses on secondary, derived conditions such as altered convection, transpiration, watering conditions, CO2, other gaseous components, and LED illumination, which creates a characteristic energy (heat and light) gradient within the growth volume.    <P>
Radishes are good candidate plants to grow on the ISS because they mature quickly (harvest after = 28 days after planting), have been grown successfully on the ISS (Massa et al., 2013); genetic and metabolic information is readily available (Shen et al., 2013); and they are nutritionally desirable and provide a wealth of information that can thoroughly be analyzed by biochemical, physiological, and genetic approaches. Radishes are good sources of minerals (especially K, Ca, Fe, and Zn), complex carbohydrates, vitamin C, dietary fibers, folic acid (vitamin B9), anthocyanins, and glucosinolates, a class of secondary metabolites characteristic for Brassicaceae. In addition to their roots, certain varieties of radish are used for their leaves, siliques, and oil. The nutritional value and versatility of these vegetables makes them good candidates as a crop plant for astronauts. The small seed size (<4 mm), longevity of seeds (up to five years), small plant size, and the ability to consume the entire plant makes radishes ideally suited for space biology.    <P>
Previous studies have focused on the effect of gravity and shown that space conditions allow successful cultivation of Brassica species (Musgrave et al., 2000). However, the quality, biomass, sensitivity of growth to day length, and (constant) temperature are important parameters for this species that have yet to be studied, especially in light of results that seed development in space cultures was compromised (Kuang et al., 2005), especially when oxygen was limited (Kuang et al., 1998). Equally unknown is the effect of environmental conditions in spacecrafts on the performance of plants. Understandably, the emphasis on space biology focuses on the effect of weightlessness and gravity on plant orientation and mechanical properties (Hoson 1999). However, conditions that are the consequence of weightlessness, e.g., lack of convection or altered atmosphere, are equally significant but unknown.    <P>
Our proposal intends to measure the metabolic, physiological, and genetic responses of radishes grown on the ISS and identify the effect of the space environment on metabolite accumulation, flavor, enzyme activity, mineral uptake, and generation time. This knowledge will be essential for the transition from Earth-bound cultivation of plants to growth conditions in space; the research is important for the establishment of human colonies on the Moon, Mars, and farther outposts.    <P>

The data that we will obtain examine much more than simple yield (mass) of the plants but include the mineral content, propensity to flower, flavor components, and water use. All attempts will not only optimize plant culture under elevated CO2, limited water, and controlled fertilizer provision, but also investigate the genetic responses of plants to mitigate space (or agricultural) stress. The overall result of the project will therefore benefit our generic understanding of factors that control plant growth and productivity in space and on Earth. <P></td>

						Space experiment:    <P>
The objective of the space flight experiment was the assessment of crop plant performance in space and to analyze the effect of weightlessness, elevated CO2, specific light conditions, and artificial substrate on plant growth and productivity.    <P>
The preparations for the flight experiments were completed and the prepared (seeded) science carrier launched on the Cygnus 14 flight on 10/2/20. The first experiment was initiated on November 3 and completed by 11/30/2020. The second grow-out started 12/1 and was completed 12/30/2020. Prior to return, samples were stored on the International Space Station (ISS) in the Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) freezer. Sample return of the biological material from the first ISS grow-out occurred May 2 and samples were transported to and stored at the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The sample return was incomplete because some leaf material was stored in a separate bag that was inadvertently left on the ISS and hopefully will be returned in July. Available samples of the first grow-out returned to the lab on June 2, 2021. The analysis of samples has been initiated and will include genetic analyses, comparisons with a ground control experiment (performed at KSC from 12/17/20 to 1/13/21). This report includes two separate activities: the comparison of remote data from ISS 1 and 2 and the ground control performed at KSC. The KSC ground control will be compared with a (UL) lab control experiment that replicates the KSC ground control (conducted at 2500 ppm CO2) at normal (400 ppm) CO2 levels.     <P>
Growth experiments performed in orbit (ISS1 and ISS2): Based on prior experience during the science verification test (SVT) and experiment verification test (EVT), the following parameters were chosen for the ISS experiments to examine growth of radish plants during a 27-day growth period in the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH). The CO2 concentration was set at 2500 ppm, reduced from the current 3500 ppm level on Station. Light intensity (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) was set at 500 µMol m-2s-1; the temperature settings fluctuated between 24°C during the light cycle and 20°C during the dark period. Temperature transition occurred over a one-hour period. The relative humidity (RH) was set at 80% during the nine days and then reduced to 65%. Diurnal fluctuations in RH values ranged between 65 and 75%. Although tissue collection and harvest were obviously performed by astronauts, the chamber was controlled remotely from the ground via the APH software.      <P>
Plant cultivation:     <P>
Each of the twenty growth positions received three seeds that were secured with water-soluble glue to floral foam. After eight days (11/11/20), the plants were thinned and only the most vigorous seedling per position was retained. Leaf samples were taken after two additional days (11/13/20); leaf samples were taken transferred to microfuge tubes and stored at -80°C. Additional leaf punch material was collected 17 and 24 days after planting (11/20 and 11/27).  Plants in all twenty positions grew comparably to ground controls (see below). After 27 days, the plants were harvested by first removing the leaves as complete canopy and photographing the spread-out leaves to assess leaf area and appearance. For future analyses, the leaves were folded into aluminum foil pouches and stored at -80°C (MELFI). After leaf harvest, the radishes (i.e., bulb tissue) were excised from the arcillite substrate, transferred into separate plastic bags, and also stored in the MELFI.     <P>
Part of the samples from the first grow-out were returned from the ISS on May 2nd and stored at KSC. These samples were transported in insulating boxes containing dry ice and delivered to University of Louisiana (UL) Lafayette on June 2nd. Of the 15 documented leaf samples, seven were returned. The remainder stayed on the ISS and are scheduled to be returned with SpaceX 22.     <P>
APH performance and plant development: Because plant performance is intimately linked to the growth environment, the first part of the report compares the ground control with the two grow-outs on orbit. Although initially two ground controls were planned, a computer update interfered with the first ground control at KSC and caused power outages for three consecutive days. A second ground control proceeded without power problems but still showed substantial differences between ISS conditions.     <P>
The differences pertained to the lighting system (520 µM m-2s-1 on the ISS versus 380 µM m-2s-1 during the first 24 days of the ground control), the relative humidity (RH) of the chamber (initially 80% in both cases but after the first week 65- 70 % for the ISS unit and 80% during the third week for the ground control), and the CO2 concentration (2500 ppm for the ground control but lower and highly fluctuating values (1800 – 2300 ppm) for the first grow-out on the ISS). The second grow-out on the ISS had only 2000 ppm CO2 during the entire growth period with much lower variability.    <P>
The water delivery and moisture levels for both ISS experiments were remarkably similar but – as expected  – differed from the ground control, which showed a strong top/bottom gradient in the moisture readings that was absent in the space experiments. The readings of all moisture sensors (two per quadrant, one at the higher position, ca. 10 mm below the surface and a lower sensor, about 10 mm above the bottom of each science carrier quadrant) showed strong daily fluctuations that controlled water delivery. For the ISS experiments, the upper sensors values were reduced but the difference between top and bottom sensors was lower and probably the result of rather high air movement (fans were set at 0.9 m/s) that enhanced evaporation of the top arcillite layer.  Higher variability of the sensor readings coincided with larger water demand.    <P>
The temperature profile for ground control and ISS experiments was comparable with high values during the photoperiod of 24°C and 20°C during dark periods.     <P>
The evaluation of mineral content, qPCR analysis in nitrogen, and glucosinolate measurements have been initiated. In contrast, RNA-seq evaluation is on hold until the material from the second ISS experiment will become available. For cost-saving reasons, all samples will have to be processed at the same time.     <P>
Plant productivity:     <P>
The leaf area per quadrant for the first ISS experiment was 938 cm2, which compares well with the data from the EVT (1033 cm2) and ? EVT (818 cm2). Weight determinations for the radish bulbs is still missing as samples need to not be thawed before processing for genetic analyses. Those will be performed with samples from the second ISS grow-out. Therefore, these data are not yet available.    <P>
Lab work    <P>
1 - Carbohydrate analyses:   In preparation for the analyses of space samples, we established the protocol for carbohydrate analysis and quantification of glucosinolates. Carbohydrate analyses (based on High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measurements with an Hypersil-gold amino, 250 x 4.6 mm column and 80% acetonitrile as isocratic mobile phase) showed that the prominent sugars of bulbs are fructose and sucrose. Examined sugars included 3-O-Methyl glucopyranose, Arabinose, Fructose, Fucose, Galactosamine, Galactose, Glucose, Lactose, Maltose, Mannitol, Mannose, Myo-inositol, Psicose, Rhamnose, Sorbitol, Sucrose, Trehalose, and Xylose.    <P>
2 – Quantification of glucosinolates. We developed a new method based on sodium palladate for the direct quantification of glucosinolates. This method is faster, more sensitive, and less error prone (does not require strong anion exchange chromatography) than the originally employed, potassium ferricyanide based method (Gallaher et al. 2012). Sodium palladate calibration curve (y = 0.0058 x (=µg sinigrin) -0.0046) has a correlation coefficient of 0.9987 and is linear between 0 to > 40 µg sinigrin.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The goal of the proposed work is to determine the effects of space flight on growth, performance (productivity and time to maturation), metabolism, and genetic changes in radish plants (Raphanus sativus). Plants will be grown in the ADVANCED PLANT HABITAT (APH) hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and in comparable experiments in ground controls. The research conforms to NASA’s top future goal of long-term space exploration and terraforming other planets and satellites. These goals depend on nutritionally valuable food crops that can be reliably grown in an environment that is not only defined by altered gravity or weightless environment but also different atmospheric conditions. In contrast to studying direct effects of gravity on plants, our approach focuses on secondary, derived conditions such as altered convection, transpiration, watering conditions, CO2, other gaseous components, and LED illumination, which creates a characteristic energy (heat and light) gradient within the growth volume.    <P>
Radishes are good candidate plants to grow on the ISS because they mature quickly (harvest after = 28 days after planting), have been grown successfully on the ISS (Massa et al., 2013); genetic and metabolic information is readily available (Shen et al., 2013); and they are nutritionally desirable and provide a wealth of information that can thoroughly be analyzed by biochemical, physiological, and genetic approaches. Radishes are good sources of minerals (especially K, Ca, Fe, and Zn), complex carbohydrates, vitamin C, dietary fibers, folic acid (vitamin B9), anthocyanins, and glucosinolates, a class of secondary metabolites characteristic for Brassicaceae. In addition to their roots, certain varieties of radish are used for their leaves, siliques, and oil. The nutritional value and versatility of these vegetables makes them good candidates as a crop plant for astronauts. The small seed size (<4 mm), longevity of seeds (up to five years), small plant size, and the ability to consume the entire plant makes radishes ideally suited for space biology.    <P>
Previous studies have focused on the effect of gravity and shown that space conditions allow successful cultivation of Brassica species (Musgrave et al., 2000). However, the quality, biomass, sensitivity of growth to day length, and (constant) temperature are important parameters for this species that have yet to be studied, especially in light of results that seed development in space cultures was compromised (Kuang et al., 2005), especially when oxygen was limited (Kuang et al., 1998). Equally unknown is the effect of environmental conditions in spacecrafts on the performance of plants. Understandably, the emphasis on space biology focuses on the effect of weightlessness and gravity on plant orientation and mechanical properties (Hoson 1999). However, conditions that are the consequence of weightlessness, e.g., lack of convection or altered atmosphere, are equally significant but unknown.    <P>
Our proposal intends to measure the metabolic, physiological, and genetic responses of radishes grown on the ISS and identify the effect of the space environment on metabolite accumulation, flavor, enzyme activity, mineral uptake, and generation time. This knowledge will be essential for the transition from Earth-bound cultivation of plants to growth conditions in space; the research is important for the establishment of human colonies on the Moon, Mars, and farther outposts.    <P>

The data that we will obtain examine much more than simple yield (mass) of the plants but include the mineral content, propensity to flower, flavor components, and water use. All attempts will not only optimize plant culture under elevated CO2, limited water, and controlled fertilizer provision, but also investigate the genetic responses of plants to mitigate space (or agricultural) stress. The overall result of the project will therefore benefit our generic understanding of factors that control plant growth and productivity in space and on Earth. <P></td>

						Based on the prior activity (previously submitted as Second year report), activities progressed on two fronts:   At the Kennedy Space Center (KSC),  an initial cultivation period was followed by the science verification test (SVT1, 5/16 – 6/13/19) and a subsequent &Delta; -SVT (9/30 – 10/30/19). The current report includes the experiment verification test (EVT), completed 12/16/19, an additional test in the Engineering Demonstration Unit (EDU) unit (4/7 – 5/4/20), and the  &Delta;  EVT (5/26 -6/22/20).    <P>
At the home institution, radish cultivation methods and light management were studied to supplement KSC activities.     <P>
Experiment Verification Test (EVT): The objective of the EVT was to examine the growth performance of radish seedlings in the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) in preparation for a planned space experiment under conditions similar to those on the International Space Station by controlling the experiment mostly by remote (indirect) control via the APH software. The test further focused on the most sensitive issues namely water, temperature, and light control of the system.     <P>
Samples were harvested at KSC and transported in insulating boxes containing dry ice directly to UL Lafayette.    <P>
APH performance and Plant Development:    A substantial improvement to prior science verification tests was a consistent water delivery system.     <P>
Test in the Engineering Demonstration Unit:  The purpose of the EDU test was to compare different fertilizer application (Nutricote vs. ½ strength MS medium) and automated water delivery vs. constant water supply through a ‘stand-pipe’ controlled system.  The EDU chamber does not provide the same fidelity as the actual, sealed APH system and therefore the CO2 concentration could not be maintained at the desired 3500 ppm level but at 2000 ppm.    <P>
&Delta; -EVT (2. Experimental Verification Test):   The objective of the second Experiment Verification Test was to assess the outcome of several adjustments made based on the results of the first EVT (11/20, through 12/16, 2019) and an additional grow-out in the EDU (4/7 – 5/4/20). Primary objectives included improved radish-bulb formation, assessment of the growth patterns, calculation of a modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and an examination of the harvested tissue in preparation for a planned space experiment.    <P>
  Plant development:   Plants were thinned to one seedling per growth position on Day 8 (6/3/20). Harvesting of tissue was performed on June 22, 2020. Despite the reduced number of plants, the overlapping leaves likely reduce light availability and thus photosynthetic performance. The biomass at harvest is likely reduced as a consequence of light competition. The curly appearance of the leaves indicates a stress response that was not observed during EVT and EDU tests. The most likely factor for this observation is the elevated CO2 concentration.     <P>
  Summary: This report of the last three tests in preparation of the flight experiment (scheduled for 9/29/2020) indicates that the growth conditions and results have been substantially improved. The watering system is functioning and the adjustment in the lighting regime (enhanced blue light) promoted bulb formation. The only parameter that cannot be compared with either EVT or EDU data is the elevated CO2 concentration during &Delta;  -EVT. Morphological changes (curling leaf edges and necrosis) indicate high CO2 stress levels. The mineral and nitrogen analyses suggest that enhanced P/K/N provision such as full-strength MS medium as opposed to the half-strength medium used in the &Delta; -EVT may mitigate these phenomena. The biological material is sufficient to assess the metabolism, morphology, and transcriptional activity after cultivation in the Advanced Plant Habitat. Lastly, Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE) sampling is a promising novel technology for space applications and allows for non-destructive transcriptional assessments. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The goal of the proposed work is to determine the effects of space flight on growth, performance (productivity and time to maturation), metabolism, and genetic changes in radish plants (Raphanus sativus). Plants will be grown in the ADVANCED PLANT HABITAT (APH) hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and in comparable experiments in ground controls. The research conforms to NASA’s top future goal of long-term space exploration and terraforming other planets and satellites. These goals depend on nutritionally valuable food crops that can be reliably grown in an environment that is not only defined by altered gravity or weightless environment but also different atmospheric conditions. In contrast to studying direct effects of gravity on plants, our approach focuses on secondary, derived conditions such as altered convection, transpiration, watering conditions, CO2, other gaseous components, and LED illumination, which creates a characteristic energy (heat and light) gradient within the growth volume.    <P>
Radishes are good candidate plants to grow on the ISS because they mature quickly (harvest after = 28 days after planting), have been grown successfully on the ISS (Massa et al., 2013); genetic and metabolic information is readily available (Shen et al., 2013); and they are nutritionally desirable and provide a wealth of information that can thoroughly be analyzed by biochemical,  physiological, and genetic approaches. Radishes are good sources of minerals (especially K, Ca, Fe, and Zn), complex carbohydrates, vitamin C, dietary fibers, folic acid (vitamin B9), anthocyanins, and glucosinolates, a class of secondary metabolites characteristic for Brassicaceae. In addition to their roots, certain varieties of radish are used for their leaves, siliques, and oil. The  nutritional value and versatility of these vegetables makes them good candidates as a crop plant for astronauts. The small seed size (<4 mm), longevity of seeds (up to five years), small plant size, and the ability to consume the entire plant makes radishes ideally suited for space biology.    <P>
Previous studies have focused on the effect of gravity and shown that space conditions allow successful cultivation of Brassica species (Musgrave et al., 2000). However, the quality, biomass, sensitivity of growth to day length, and (constant) temperature are important parameters for this species that have yet to be studied, especially in light of results that seed development in space cultures was compromised (Kuang et al., 2005), especially when oxygen was limited (Kuang et al., 1998). Equally unknown is the effect of environmental conditions in spacecrafts on the performance of plants. Understandably, the emphasis on space biology focuses on the effect of weightlessness and gravity on plant orientation and mechanical properties (Hoson 1999). However, conditions that are the consequence of weightlessness, e.g., lack of convection or altered atmosphere, are equally significant but unknown.    <P>
Our proposal intends to measure the metabolic, physiological, and genetic responses of radishes grown on the ISS and identify the effect of the space environment on metabolite accumulation, flavor, enzyme activity, mineral uptake, and generation time. This knowledge will be essential for the transition from Earth-bound cultivation of plants to growth conditions in space; the research is important for the establishment of human colonies on the Moon, Mars, and farther outposts.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The objective to grow plants under space conditions requires optimization of auxiliary parameters such as light intensity, quality, watering, substrate definition, fertilization that all have immediate implications for   more efficient agricultural practices. The data that we will obtain examine much more than simple yield (mass) of the plants but include the mineral content, propensity to flower, flavor components, and water use. All attempts will not only optimize plant culture under elevated CO2, limited water, and controlled fertilizer provision, but also investigate the genetic responses of plants to mitigate space (or agricultural) stress. The overall result of the project will therefore benefit our generic understanding of factors that control plant growth and productivity in space and on Earth. <P></td>

						Choice of seed material: We tested germination rate and percentage of germination of nine different varieties of Raphanus sativus from two sources and determined that the variety Cherry Belle, which completes the growth cycle in approximately 23 days is best suited for all future experiments.    <P>
Seed sanitation: To accommodate long-term storage and minimize surface-borne microorganisms, we sanitized seeds based on several protocols, including bleach and ethanol. The high mortality rate after as little as one-minute exposure to 70% ethanol resulted in the following protocol:    <P>
Substrate development. The predetermined use of arcillite (calcined Montmorillonite) for prior Kennedy Space Center (KSC)-based experiments, its porous structure (defined for 1 to 3 mm grains), inert properties at neutral pH, low density (~0.69 g×cm-3), and hydrophilicity suggested its use as growth substrate. The initial strategy relied on the use of slow-release fertilizer (Nutricote) as plant nutrient resource. However, the slow release given the fast maturation required a better and more uniform provision of mineral elements. The chosen strategy now relies on inclusion of a modified Murashige and Skoog medium. Because of corrosion concerns, this medium is now prepared without chloride.   While arcillite without fertilizer is inadequate for growth a single application of MS nutrients is sufficient for at least two crops (12 plants per 2 L volume of arcillite). Plant growth was superior to Nutricote. Initial tests were performed in common plastic containers; later experiments were based on science carrier replicates (3D-printed boxes and covers of the same size as the science carrier). These containers enhanced the fidelity of the experiments by providing the same substrate depth and volume for root growth.    <P>
Because water content is critical for the formation of radishes, we studied the water consumption. Based on five 4-week long experiments, the water consumption turned out a function of leaf area, light intensity, and temperature. The water loss increases with age (produced leaf material) from an initial range of 80 to 100 mL per day per 12 plants to 500-600 mL per day as the plants mature. The low water capacity of arcillite requires daily watering, especially in the last two weeks of growth.    <P>
Light conditions: Initial experiments relied on a regular growth chamber with high intensity white fluorescent lights (Percival E-54U). The PAR light intensity of this chamber is about 130 µmol m-2 s-1. A newly acquired high intensity LED based light fixture (Heliospectra RX30) has programmable spectral light qualities up to 1000 µmol m-2 s-1. The increased light intensity increased water consumption but produced considerably larger radishes and plants.    <P>
Analytical work: We examined the mineral composition of harvested plant tissue (leaf and radish), and the ion activity of arcillite substrate. The mineral composition of Cherry Belle radishes confirms the high amount of potassium in all tissues. There are no substantial differences between mineral content of leaves and radish tissue on a dry weight basis.     <P>
Part of the flight experiment aims to assess the effect of space conditions on the secondary compounds. Brassicaceae are known as a rich source of glucosinolates. Therefore, we examined the yield of glucosinolate contents in fresh and stored (frozen) material. The average yield was 120 µmol glucosinolates per 100 mg fresh weight. This amount was not affected by frozen storage up to three months. These data are important because flight material will only be analyzable after extended frozen storage on station.    <P>
In contrast to metabolites, the longevity of some mRNA was reduced the longer tissue was stored frozen. Among the tested transcription products (mRNAs) peroxidase precursor (EU369394.1) showed a continuous decline in bulb (= radish) tissue but this decline was not observed in leaf tissue. Leaf tissue also contained significantly less transcript compared to bulb tissue. The data indicate that we can reliably quantify gene transcription, but they also indicate that culture conditions, light quality, fertilizer status and storage conditions will affect the outcome of the analyses.     <P>
The nitrogen content of tissue depends on light and photoperiod and fertilizer content. Since a lot of effort went into analyzing corrosion susceptibility of the AHP hardware, we tested the amount of nitrogen in tissue when plants were grown in Murashige-Skoog vs. Hoagland medium. The overall nitrogen quantity in leaf and bulb tissue of MS medium-grown plants was about twice that of Hoagland-grown plants. In addition to nutrients, the quality of light also affected growth. We discovered that culture conditions with high intensity of blue light reduced water consumption and enhanced biomass compared to red or mixed (red & blue) light conditions without affecting the overall mineral content.    <P>
The work performed in the first 18 months was necessary for the preparation of the Science Verification Test (SVT), which started May 16, 2019. The SVT compared the growth of radish in two configurations – either five or nine plants per science carrier quadrant. This test will evaluate which number of plants can be supported in a given area under otherwise identical conditions. Illumination and therefore photosynthesis will be reduced when plants grow too densely. Therefore, the SVT will not only provide valuable information on hardware performance but also inform our experimental evaluation of growth parameters. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The goal of the proposed work is to determine the effects of space flight on growth, performance (productivity and time to maturation), metabolism, and genetic changes in radish plants (Raphanus sativus). Plants will be grown in the ADVANCED PLANT HABITAT (APH) hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and in comparable experiments in ground controls. The research conforms to NASA’s top future goal of long-term space exploration and terraforming other planets and satellites. These goals depend on nutritionally valuable food crops that can be reliably grown in an environment that is not only defined by altered gravity or weightless environment but also different atmospheric conditions. In contrast to studying direct effects of gravity on plants, our approach focuses on secondary, derived conditions such as altered convection, transpiration, watering conditions, CO2, other gaseous components, and LED illumination, which creates a characteristic energy (heat and light) gradient within the growth volume.    <P>
Radishes are good candidate plants to grow on the ISS because they mature quickly (harvest after = 28 days after planting), have been grown successfully on the ISS (Massa et al., 2013); genetic and metabolic information is readily available (Shen et al., 2013), and they are nutritionally desirable and provide a wealth of information that can thoroughly be analyzed by biochemical,  physiological, and genetic approaches. Radishes are good sources of minerals (especially K, Ca, Fe, and Zn), complex carbohydrates, vitamin C, dietary fibers, folic acid (vitamin B9), anthocyanins, and glucosinolates, a class of secondary metabolites characteristic for Brassicaceae. In addition to their roots, certain varieties of radish are used for their leaves, siliques, and oil. The  nutritional value and versatility of these vegetables makes them good candidates as a crop plant for astronauts. The small seed size (<4 mm), longevity of seeds (up to five years), small plant size, and the ability to consume the entire plant makes radishes ideally suited for space biology.    <P>
Previous studies have focused on the effect of gravity and shown that space conditions allow successful cultivation of Brassica species (Musgrave et al., 2000). However, the quality, biomass, sensitivity of growth to day length, and (constant) temperature are important parameters for this species that have yet to be studied, especially in light of results that seed development in space  cultures was compromised (Kuang et al., 2005), especially when oxygen was limited (Kuang et al., 1998). Equally unknown is the effect of environmental conditions in spacecrafts on the performance of plants. Understandably, the emphasis on space biology focuses on the effect of weightlessness and gravity on plant orientation and mechanical properties (Hoson 1999). However, conditions that are the consequence of weightlessness, e.g., lack of convection or altered atmosphere, are equally significant but unknown.    <P>
Our proposal intends to measure the metabolic, physiological, and genetic responses of radishes grown on the ISS and identify the effect of the space environment on metabolite accumulation, flavor, enzyme activity, mineral uptake, and generation time. This knowledge will be essential for the transition from Earth-bound cultivation of plants to growth conditions in space; the research is important for the establishment of human colonies on the Moon, Mars, and farther outposts.    <P>
