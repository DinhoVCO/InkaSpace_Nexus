                    <td colspan="3"> Opportunistic pathogens such as latent viruses pose a unique hazard to crew members because of the ineffectiveness of preflight quarantine periods and decreased immune function. Latent herpesviruses reactivate and shed in higher quantities during and after long and short spaceflights. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important herpesvirus from a public health viewpoint that causes severe systemic infections upon primary infection or on reactivation from latency. The few antiviral drugs available to treat CMV infection suffer from safety, efficacy, and resistance issues, and no vaccine against CMV is currently available. As NASA and collaborating space agencies plan for future exploration class missions (i.e., to Mars or an asteroid), eliminating the risk of an adverse health event due to alterations in virus latency, reactivation, and lytic replication is paramount. Evidence of impaired control of latent viral infections has been documented during short (i.e., 14-day Space Shuttle missions) as well as long (i.e., 6-month International Space Station missions) duration spaceflight missions, with the magnitude of this response being positively associated with time in flight. Shedding of herpesviruses including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and CMV was detected in >30% of astronauts in a recent study (Mehta et al., 2017) looking at long-duration spaceflight (60–180 days). These viruses reactivated independently of each other and reactivation frequency increased in duration, and amplitude (viral copy numbers) when compared to short duration (10 to 16 days) space shuttle missions. Thus, it is easy to speculate that the substantially longer durations being proposed for exploration class missions (i.e., up to 3 years) will further increase the risk of an adverse health event due to increased virus reactivation and/or replication. Add increased radiation exposure (both duration and magnitude), limited clinical care, and the impossibility of rapidly returning a casualty back to Earth to the list of potential hazards and it is clear to see why obtaining a better understanding of virus replication under space-like conditions is critical to successfully and safely send humans to, and return them from, these remote extraterrestrial destinations. In this proposal, we aim to determine the impact of space radiation on CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. While most studies on this topic in the past have focused on changes in the human immune system that could induce virus reactivation, we will approach this topic from both virus and host standpoints. We will study differences in CMV latency and reactivation before and after radiation exposure and determine if these changes can be correlated with specific changes in virus genome and/or transcriptome. Also, because virus control, dissemination, and resolution are ultimately governed by the competency, or lack thereof, of the host immune system, we will determine the impact of pre-exposing NK-cells and T-cells to space radiation on their ability to control active CMV infections. In this project, we will focus on a single variable: space radiation, rather than looking at multiple variables such as microgravity, physical and psychological stresses of space travel, diet, medications, or other factors associated with spaceflight. The overarching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce specific changes in CMV genome/transcriptome or immune control of infection that will induce CMV reactivation and/or increase in virus replication and pathogenicity. The specific aims to test this hypothesis are:      <P>
  Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of space radiation on CMV genome and transcriptome.      <P>
  Specific Aim 2: Correlate radiation induced changes in CMV genome and/or transcriptome with CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication.      <P>
  Specific Aim 3: Determine the impact of space radiation on immune cell control in a mouse model of CMV infection.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Upon completion of this project, we will gain a better understanding of how radiation impacts CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. By measuring gene expression on infected cells exposed to radiation, using both traditional and cutting-edge techniques, we will be able to identify CMV genomic and transcriptomic changes that affect virus behavior. We will also determine if space radiation can impair NK-cell and T-cell function, allowing for CMV to replicate and disseminate in the host. This will allow us to determine the risk of CMV infection during spaceflight missions and gain a better understanding of the potential underpinning mechanisms. Findings from this study could lead to the development of appropriate countermeasures to ameliorate potential clinical risks associated with CMV reactivation in flight. Moreover, the methods incorporated here can be adapted to examine the effects of radiation on other relevant viral pathogens known to cause significant disease in immunocompromised people that may also pose a risk to crewmembers during spaceflight missions. Discovering the mechanisms of virus reactivation will help with the development of treatment modalities for patients on Earth. <P></td>

NOTE: P.I. changed to S. Shay effective 10/05/2023. For subsequent reporting, please see "Effect of Space Radiation on Cytomegalovirus Reactivation and Lytic Replication (P.I.-- Shay)". (Ed. 10/15/23)    <P>
###    <P>
Kasumi cells are hematopoetic stem cell derived monocyte progenitor cells that were infected with a low dose of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and establishment of latency was monitored by analyzing viral gene expression as well as genome copy numbers. Kasumi cells offer an established model of CMV latency and are amenable to latency establishment as well as reactivation in the laboratory. They do not allow lytic viral replication unless differentiated. Once CMV latency was established in these cells, the cells were exposed to gamma, proton, and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) radiation (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0Gy) for different time points (e g., 0 to 30 days) at the Brookvaven National Laboratory (BNL) in New York. The cells were harvested at different times after the irradiation and analyzed for viral load by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It was interesting to note that there was an increase in the viral load for almost all the radiation concentrations used six days after the exposure of gamma, proton, and GCR. The data is being analyzed for statistical significance and interpretation.    <P>
To date, we have performed 3 out of our proposed 5 ion experiments (during the Spring and Summer 2021 sessions) to determine the impact of space radiation on CMV genome, transcriptome, and reactivation potential. Data from those experiments have been generated and are being analyzed. The addition of the Spring/Summer 2023 experiments will close this aspect of the study and allow for continuation into the next in vivo experimental phase of the project.    <P>
The Principal Investigator (PI) and team’s accelerator experience: Dr. Satish Mehta has been to BNL on numerous previous occasions and assisted in the ion radiation exposure of our latently infected Epstein-Barr Virus cell lines. Dr. Douglass Diak has never been onsite at BNL but organized the Spring and Summer 2021 shipping/receiving of the latently infected CMV cell lines to/from BNL. In the process, he completed all necessary safety training for onsite BNL work as well.    <P>
We conducted a similar study at NSRL and the current beam times requested match our historical times, but more importantly have been established using the NSRL beam time calculator. The exposure times are in direct relation to the energy dose requirements (10, 50, 100, and 200cGy), which again match our past radiation studies. Our radiation expert here at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) has recommended these energy doses as well as these radiation sources: gamma, proton, C-12, and Fe-56-. His suggestions are based on the probability of exposure to these sources during actual spaceflight, making our radiation source selection highly relevant to our space study correlations. Though we understand that cosmic radiation is a combination of these individual sources, we believe our understanding of CMV reactivation in response to each of these sources, independently, is crucial.     <P>
Again, these sources and doses were recommended to us by our resident radiation expert. Additionally, we conducted a similar study and found that these sources and doses were highly effective in stimulating Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) to reactivate.  See: Reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr Virus: A comparison after exposure to gamma, proton, carbon and iron radiation, doi:10.3990/ijms19102961.    <P>
Kasumi cells from the above experiments were also subjected to genomics and transcriptomics studies to reveal single nucleotide polymorphisms or other variations in the genome of irradiated cells compared to mock, and reveal any transcripts that are significantly altered in expression. Total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi cells from the above experiment and was sent for DNA as well as RNA sequencing at Microbial genome sequence center (MiGS) in Pittsburgh, PA. Selected samples were sequenced from the above experiment.    <P>
Genomic analysis: Initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal any genomic variants. The analysis is still ongoing.    <P>
Transcriptomic analysis: Differentially expressed genes comparing the GCR-Day6 cells to pre-exposed cells were analyzed. Interestingly, only UL49 shows a significantly elevated level in GCR-Day6 cells compared to mock. UL49 mutants are currently being made in the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome in order to study its role in latency reactivation. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Opportunistic pathogens such as latent viruses pose a unique hazard to crew members because of the ineffectiveness of preflight quarantine periods and decreased immune function. Latent herpesviruses reactivate and shed in higher quantities during and after long and short spaceflights. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important herpesvirus from a public health viewpoint that causes severe systemic infections upon primary infection or on reactivation from latency. The few antiviral drugs available to treat CMV infection suffer from safety, efficacy, and resistance issues, and no vaccine against CMV is currently available. As NASA and collaborating space agencies plan for future exploration class missions (i.e., to Mars or an asteroid), eliminating the risk of an adverse health event due to alterations in virus latency, reactivation, and lytic replication is paramount. Evidence of impaired control of latent viral infections has been documented during short (i.e., 14-day Space Shuttle missions) as well as long (i.e., 6-month International Space Station missions) duration spaceflight missions, with the magnitude of this response being positively associated with time in flight. Shedding of herpesviruses including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and CMV was detected in >30% of astronauts in a recent study (Mehta et al., 2017) looking at long-duration spaceflight (60–180 days). These viruses reactivated independently of each other and reactivation frequency increased in duration, and amplitude (viral copy numbers) when compared to short duration (10 to 16 days) space shuttle missions. Thus, it is easy to speculate that the substantially longer durations being proposed for exploration class missions (i.e., up to 3 years) will further increase the risk of an adverse health event due to increased virus reactivation and/or replication. Add increased radiation exposure (both duration and magnitude), limited clinical care, and the impossibility of rapidly returning a casualty back to Earth to the list of potential hazards and it is clear to see why obtaining a better understanding of virus replication under space-like conditions is critical to successfully and safely send humans to, and return them from, these remote extraterrestrial destinations. In this proposal, we aim to determine the impact of space radiation on CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. While most studies on this topic in the past have focused on changes in the human immune system that could induce virus reactivation, we will approach this topic from both virus and host standpoints. We will study differences in CMV latency and reactivation before and after radiation exposure and determine if these changes can be correlated with specific changes in virus genome and/or transcriptome. Also, because virus control, dissemination, and resolution are ultimately governed by the competency, or lack thereof, of the host immune system, we will determine the impact of pre-exposing NK-cells and T-cells to space radiation on their ability to control active CMV infections. In this project, we will focus on a single variable: space radiation, rather than looking at multiple variables such as microgravity, physical and psychological stresses of space travel, diet, medications, or other factors associated with spaceflight. The overarching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce specific changes in CMV genome/transcriptome or immune control of infection that will induce CMV reactivation and/or increase in virus replication and pathogenicity. The specific aims to test this hypothesis are:      <P>
  Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of space radiation on CMV genome and transcriptome.      <P>
  Specific Aim 2: Correlate radiation induced changes in CMV genome and/or transcriptome with CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication.      <P>
  Specific Aim 3: Determine the impact of space radiation on immune cell control in a mouse model of CMV infection.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Upon completion of this project, we will gain a better understanding of how radiation impacts CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. By measuring gene expression on infected cells exposed to radiation, using both traditional and cutting-edge techniques, we will be able to identify CMV genomic and transcriptomic changes that affect virus behavior. We will also determine if space radiation can impair NK-cell and T-cell function, allowing for CMV to replicate and disseminate in the host. This will allow us to determine the risk of CMV infection during spaceflight missions and gain a better understanding of the potential underpinning mechanisms. Findings from this study could lead to the development of appropriate countermeasures to ameliorate potential clinical risks associated with CMV reactivation in flight. Moreover, the methods incorporated here can be adapted to examine the effects of radiation on other relevant viral pathogens known to cause significant disease in immunocompromised people that may also pose a risk to crewmembers during spaceflight missions. Discovering the mechanisms of virus reactivation will help with the development of treatment modalities for patients on Earth. <P></td>

						Preliminary data from our lab illustrates that Kasumi-3 myeloid progenitor cells (ATCC CRL-2725) are a viable and robust cell line for use in simulated microgravity (SMG) infection studies. We have validated the viability of these cells in SMG, validated an infection protocol using these cells and clinical-grade TB40/E cytomegalovirus (CMV) strain, and we have plated infected Kasumi-3 cells in both SMG and traditional FLASK conditions.     <P>
Validation of Kasumi-3 in SMG: Kasumi-3 cells were brought up and maintained in ATCC® Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI 1640) Medium, supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1.4 mL of Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine. Cultures were sustained in humidified 37°C /5%CO2 incubators, while all appropriate parameters for tissue culture were monitored throughout the entirety of the study. Cells were collected, combined, and divided among 4 culture vessels, two standard T-75cm2 canted neck flasks and two 50 mL rotating wall vessels (RWV), so that the plating density/concentration was 25 x 106 cells per vessel. We took aliquots from each SMG or FLASK culture vessel on days 1, 4, 8, and 12, to analyze cell count, cell size, and cell viability. Kasumi-3 viability increased immediately with exposure to SMG and was consistently higher throughout the trial with numbers ranging between 90-95%.    <P>
Validation of Kasumi-3 infection protocol: Using the single vial of the TB40/E virus we obtained from Dr. Ritesh Tandon’s lab, we passaged and propagated our own viral stock by infecting MRC5 human embryonic lung fibroblast cells. The “virus concentration or infectious dose” was determined by accomplishing a plaque-forming unit (PFU) assay where our value was 5.4x107 pfu/mL. We used the PFU to establish the multiplicity of infection (MOI) for the actual infection trial. We infected the Kasumi-3 cells from our SMG validation study above; from both conditions, in 12 well plates, MOI of 1, via high-speed centrifugation and then plated them in FLASKS with a plating density of 25 x 106 cells per vessel. Non-infected Kasumi-3 cells were maintained for use as our negative control also plated in the FLASK condition. We took aliquots from each FLASK on days 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 to analyze cell count, cell size, and cell viability, and confirmed infection by RT-PCR. The data, shown below, show that cells pretreated to SMG have lower viral load 24 hours post-infection in 1g/FLASK condition. This suggests that perhaps the Kasumi-3 cells pretreated SMG are less susceptible to viral infection.     <P>
We brought up fresh Kasumi-3 cells and maintained them in ATCC RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1.4 mL of Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine. Cultures were sustained in humidified 37°C /5%CO2 incubators, while all appropriate parameters for tissue culture were again monitored throughout the entirety of the study.  Cells were maintained until concentrations conducive to large-scale infection were accomplished. Then cells were collected, combined, and then further divided (25 x 106) among SMG and FLASK conditions, as well as the non-infected controls for each gravitational group. Cells fated for infection were infected in 50 mL conical tubes at a MOI of 1 and then plated on 12 well plates. Non-infected cells were plated on separate 12 well plates, and then all plates were centrifuged at high speed. Cells collected from the 12 well plates were then plated in their respective vessels for their designated condition with a plating density of 25 x 106 cells per vessel. Non-infected Kasumi-3 cells were maintained for use as our negative control in both SMG and FLASK conditions. SMG was accomplished in 50 mL RWV rotating at 10 rpm.  An aliquot was taken from each SMG or FLASK culture vessel on days 1, 4, 8, and 12. Cell count, cell size, and cell viability were obtained for all aliquots. Approximately 1 million cells were removed for RT-PCR analysis where viral load was determined for both cell pellet and supernatant fractions. We discovered that the cell pellet fractions for all gravitational conditions yield significantly higher viral load (ranged between 171 and 464, mean 318 ± SE 24) than supernatant fractions (<20 copies/ng of total DNA). We further determined that the viral loads from the FLASK/1g conditions were significantly higher than the SMG condition (p<.007).  We, therefore, deduced that SMG impedes viral expansion probably due to the lack of direct cell contact, and we presented this data at the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) conference as well as the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) workshop.     <P>
In total, we have had six successful Kasumi-3 infection experiments. Each of these were confirmed via RT-PCR, but we additionally confirmed two of these infections using mab810X-Alexa 488(IE-1) antibody staining, and for one infection where we used a Towne-BAC-GFP CMV strain, we confirmed via confocal imaging.     <P>
Radiation experiments:     <P>
Kasumi cells that are hematopoietic stem cell-derived monocyte progenitor cells were infected with a low dose of CMV and establishment of latency was monitored by analyzing viral gene expression as well as genome copy numbers. Kasumi cells offer an established model of CMV latency and are amenable to latency establishment as well as reactivation in the laboratory. They do not allow lytic viral replication unless differentiated. Once CMV latency was established in these cells, the cells were exposed to gamma, proton, and GCR radiation (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 Gy) for different time points (e.g., 0 to 30 days) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) NY. The cells were harvested at different times after the irradiation and analyzed for viral load by real-time PCR.    <P>
It was interesting to note that there was an increase in the viral load for almost all the radiation concentrations used six days after the exposure of gamma, proton, and GCR. The data is being analyzed for statistical significance and interpretation.    <P>
Genomics and Transcriptomics: Kasumi cells from the above experiments were also subjected to genomics and transcriptomics studies to reveal single nucleotide polymorphisms or other variations in the genome of irradiated cells compared to mock, and reveal any transcripts that are significantly altered in expression. Total nucleic acid (TNA) was extracted from the Kasumi cells from the above experiment and was sent for DNA as well as RNA sequencing at the Microbial genome sequence center (MiGS) at Pittsburgh, PA. Selected samples were sequenced from the above experiment.    <P>
Genomic analysis: Initial set of 22 samples (pre-radiation, D6, D12, GCR, Proton) did not reveal any genomic variants. The analysis is still ongoing.    <P>
Transcriptomic analysis:  Interestingly, only one viral gene shows a significantly elevated level in GCR-Day6 cells compared to mock. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Opportunistic pathogens such as latent viruses pose a unique hazard to crewmembers because of the ineffectiveness of preflight quarantine periods and decreased immune function. Latent herpesviruses reactivate and shed in higher quantities during and after long and short spaceflights. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important herpesvirus from public health viewpoint that causes severe systemic infections upon primary infection or on reactivation from latency. The few antiviral drugs available to treat CMV infection suffer from safety, efficacy, and resistance issues, and no vaccine against CMV is currently available. As NASA and collaborating space agencies plan for future exploration class missions (i.e., to Mars or an asteroid), eliminating the risk of an adverse health event due to alterations in virus latency, reactivation, and lytic replication is paramount. Evidence of impaired control of latent viral infections has been documented during short (i.e., 14-day Space Shuttle missions) as well as long (i.e., 6-month International Space Station missions) duration spaceflight missions, with the magnitude of this response being positively associated with time in flight. Shedding of herpesviruses including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and CMV was detected in >30% astronauts in a recent study (Mehta et al., 2017) looking at long-duration spaceflight (60–180 days). These viruses reactivated independently of each other and reactivation frequency increased in duration, and amplitude (viral copy numbers) when compared to short duration (10 to 16 days) space shuttle missions. Thus, it is easy to speculate that the substantially longer durations being proposed for exploration class missions (i.e., up to 3 years) will further increase the risk of an adverse health event due to increased virus reactivation and/or replication. Add increased radiation exposure (both duration and magnitude), limited clinical care, and the impossibility of rapidly returning a casualty back to Earth to the list of potential hazards and it is clear to see why obtaining a better understanding of virus replication under space like conditions is critical to successfully and safely send humans to, and return them from, these remote extraterrestrial destinations. In this proposal, we aim to determine the impact of space radiation on CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. While most studies on this topic in the past have focused on changes in human immune system that could induce virus reactivation, we will approach this topic from both virus and host standpoints. We will study differences in CMV latency and reactivation before and after radiation exposure and determine if these changes can be correlated with specific changes in virus genome and/or transcriptome. Also, because virus control, dissemination, and resolution are ultimately governed by the competency, or lack thereof, of the host immune system, we will determine the impact of pre-exposing NK-cells and T-cells to space radiation on their ability to control active CMV infections. In this project, we will focus on a single variable: the space radiation, rather than looking at multiple variables such as microgravity, physical and psychological stresses of space travel, diet, medications, or other factors associated with spaceflight. The overarching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce specific changes in CMV genome/transcriptome or immune control of infection that will induce CMV reactivation and/or increase in virus replication and pathogenicity. The specific aims to test this hypothesis are:      <P>
  Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of space radiation on CMV genome and transcriptome.      <P>
  Specific Aim 2: Correlate radiation induced changes in CMV genome and/or transcriptome with CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication.      <P>
  Specific Aim 3: Determine the impact of space radiation on immune cell control in a mouse model of CMV infection.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Upon completion of this project we will gain a better understanding of how radiation impacts CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. By measuring gene expression on infected cells exposed to radiation, using both traditional and cutting-edge techniques, we will be able to identify CMV genomic and transcriptomic changes that affect virus behavior. We will also determine if space radiation can impair NK-cell and T-cell function, allowing for CMV to replicate and disseminate in the host. This will allow us to determine the risk of CMV infection during spaceflight missions and gain a better understanding of the potential underpinning mechanisms. Findings from this study could lead to the development of appropriate countermeasures to ameliorate potential clinical risks associated with CMV reactivation in flight. Moreover, the methods incorporated here can be adapted to examine the effects of radiation on other relevant viral pathogens known to cause significant disease in immunocompromised people that may also pose a risk to crewmembers during spaceflight missions. Discovering the mechanisms of virus reactivation will help with the development of treatment modalities for patients on Earth. <P></td>

						Future exploration class missions will take crews beyond the protection of the Earth’s magnetosphere and the Van Allen Radiation belt. This will potentially expose the crews to greater doses of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) therefore increasing the risk of adverse health events for these crewmembers. GCR is a mixture of different radiation sources including protons, helium ions, and heavy ions coming from a myriad of galactic sources including the sun. Its particles move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate shuttle and space station walls, as well as human skin, cells, and DNA. It is very likely that GCR will exacerbate an already progressive CMV reactivation. CMV reactivation has both short-term and long-term consequences for the infected crewmembers as spaceflight induces immune compromise that interferes with its capacity to control viral reactivation. In the absence of immune control, a progressive CMV infection can lead to multiple end organ diseases such as chorioretinitis, encephalitis, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia (Seitz 2010). It is therefore necessary to determine the impact of space radiation on CMV latency and reactivation in order to make space travel safer. This study, therefore, sought to investigate the effect of simulated GCR on the reactivation rates of CMV in Kasumi-3 myeloid progenitor cells. Latently infected Kasumi-3 cells were treated with varying gamma radiation doses to evaluate potential differences in reactivation kinetics. Potential outcome variables were determined as changes in viral load, and changes/modifications in gene transcription.     <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Opportunistic pathogens such as latent viruses pose a unique hazard to crewmembers because of the ineffectiveness of preflight quarantine periods and decreased immune function. Latent herpesviruses reactivate and shed in higher quantities during and after long and short spaceflights. Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important herpesvirus from public health viewpoint that causes severe systemic infections upon primary infection or on reactivation from latency. The few antiviral drugs available to treat CMV infection suffer from safety, efficacy, and resistance issues, and no vaccine against CMV is currently available. As NASA and collaborating space agencies plan for future exploration class missions (i.e., to Mars or an asteroid), eliminating the risk of an adverse health event due to alterations in virus latency, reactivation, and lytic replication is paramount. Evidence of impaired control of latent viral infections has been documented during short (i.e., 14-day Space Shuttle missions) as well as long (i.e., 6-month International Space Station missions) duration spaceflight missions, with the magnitude of this response being positively associated with time in flight. Shedding of herpesviruses including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and CMV was detected in >30% astronauts in a recent study (Mehta et al., 2017) looking at long-duration spaceflight (60–180 days). These viruses reactivated independently of each other and reactivation frequency increased in duration, and amplitude (viral copy numbers) when compared to short duration (10 to 16 days) space shuttle missions. Thus, it is easy to speculate that the substantially longer durations being proposed for exploration class missions (i.e., up to 3 years) will further increase the risk of an adverse health event due to increased virus reactivation and/or replication. Add increased radiation exposure (both duration and magnitude), limited clinical care, and the impossibility of rapidly returning a casualty back to Earth to the list of potential hazards and it is clear to see why obtaining a better understanding of virus replication under space like conditions is critical to successfully and safely send humans to, and return them from, these remote extraterrestrial destinations. In this proposal, we aim to determine the impact of space radiation on CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication. While most studies on this topic in the past have focused on changes in human immune system that could induce virus reactivation, we will approach this topic from both virus and host standpoints. We will study differences in CMV latency and reactivation before and after radiation exposure and determine if these changes can be correlated with specific changes in virus genome and/or transcriptome. Also, because virus control, dissemination, and resolution are ultimately governed by the competency, or lack thereof, of the host immune system, we will determine the impact of pre-exposing NK-cells and T-cells to space radiation on their ability to control active CMV infections. In this project, we will focus on a single variable: the space radiation, rather than looking at multiple variables such as microgravity, physical and psychological stresses of space travel, diet, medications, or other factors associated with spaceflight. The overarching hypothesis is that modeled space radiation will induce specific changes in CMV genome/transcriptome or immune control of infection that will induce CMV reactivation and/or increase in virus replication and pathogenicity. The specific aims to test this hypothesis are:      <P>
  Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of space radiation on CMV genome and transcriptome.      <P>
  Specific Aim 2: Correlate radiation induced changes in CMV genome and/or transcriptome with CMV latency, reactivation, and lytic replication.      <P>
  Specific Aim 3: Determine the impact of space radiation on immune cell control in a mouse model of CMV infection.    <P>
