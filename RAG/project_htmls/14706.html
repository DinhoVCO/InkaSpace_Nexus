                    <td colspan="3"> A. Project Description - Long-duration exploration in space has emphasized the importance of understanding how to grow plants under microgravity, so as to supply crews with a continuous source of fresh food as well as provide psychological benefits. Plant and animal microbiomes have been known to play a significant role in maintaining host health and development through the regulation of metabolic and immune responses. Therefore, understanding the microbial population associated with plant growth and suppressing multi-host pathogenesis in spaceflight is not only crucial for sustaining the production of edible crops in space but also vital for the safety of crew members. The objective of this ground-based investigation is to develop a refined understanding of the basal plant microbiome of salad crops grown in plant growth chambers under previously used International Space Station (ISS) growth conditions and assess its potential for plant growth enhancements and human pathogenicity. Defining the basal plant microbiome will enable us to understand how spaceflight causes alterations in plant-microbial interactions and how to utilize it for future space exploration efforts. Hence, the overall goal of this project is to determine the influence of microorganisms associated with salad crops in plant growth and protection against pathogenesis under conditions similar to the ISS by utilizing metagenomics and metatranscriptomic approaches. Our central hypothesis is that changes in gene expression within the microbial population are key to understanding whether the plant microbiome can promote the growth of these crops through growth enhancement pathways. To investigate this hypothesis the following objectives were proposed:    <P>
Objective 1 – to define the metatranscriptome of three different crops grown in plant growth chambers under ISS conditions.    <P>
Objective 2 – to develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways and signaling leading to plant growth enhancements and/or to plant/human pathogenesis identified from the metatranscriptomic data.    <P>
Objective 3 – to develop methods for enhancing plant growth or suppressing the pathogenic activity without eradicating commensal or saprophytic microbes.    <P>
B. Significance - The rationale behind this proposal is to advance the technical readiness necessary to support a sustainable source of fresh food production for extraterrestrial exploration, and this will be accomplished by establishing a strong foundation in understanding how plant-microbe interactions impact the safe and successful production of plants. At the completion of these studies, it is expected that information gathered on the basal microbiome of salad crops cultivated in growth chambers similar to environmental conditions on the ISS will identify those microbes that have the potential to result in multi-host pathogenesis. The proposed metatranscriptomic studies, together with the metagenomic studies conducted by the space food production team at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), will help elucidate the functional pathways and mechanisms by which microbes interact with their host under ISS growth conditions. These data will then allow us to make crucial and informed engineering choices on plant growth hardware systems and crop selection for future space exploration vehicles and habitats. Furthermore, this study will provide new insights into standard terrestrial plant biology as little is currently known about the microbiome of salad crops. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> There exists a limited amount of knowledge about how the vast majority of plant-associated microorganisms impacts the plant’s growth, health, and susceptibility to diseases. To date, the interplay between plants and microorganisms has been largely studied for various leaf pathogens, symbiotic rhizobia, and mycorrhizal fungi. However, little is known about the microbiome of salad crops. Salad crops require minimal processing before consumption and are used to investigate the baseline microbial data for developing space-related produce sanitation methods for safe consumption by the crew. So far, microbial studies performed on salad vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, and cilantro, are mostly culture-dependent methods to determine whether human pathogens survive and persist on the edible surface of the leaves. A survey of the salad microbiome and how it plays a role in maintaining the host’s health and development is lacking. Investigations conducted in spaceflight have revealed that microgravity does alter the plant-microbe interaction at both the genetic and physiological level, with a tendency to increase the susceptibility to plant pathogenesis. It is therefore necessary that a cultivation-independent analysis of the microbial communities found on salad crops be investigated with multi-omics, predominantly metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. <P></td>

In total, we have two published manuscripts that stem from this postdoctoral fellowship, three oral presentations for the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) (2020-2021), one poster presentation at ASGSR (2019), and another manuscript in preparation. [Ed. Note: for publications, see Cumulative Bibliography. For presentations, see list at end of Task Progress section.]    <P>
Research Progress for each Objective:    <P>
Objective 1 – to define the metatranscriptome of three different crops grown in plant growth chambers under ISS conditions.    <P>
Major Outcomes: The major outcomes of this objective were: 1) The 28-day old lettuce metatranscriptome was established and published using the MinION sequencing platform. 2) Illumina NOVAseq sequencing of all lettuce samples at 4 different stages of development was completed and data analysis is nearly completed. 3) High-quality RNA has been extracted from Mizuna samples and optimization for library sequencing has been completed.    <P>
Details of work progress:   In YR1 of the project, the "veggie team" at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) completed the growth of all three crops (lettuce, tomato, and mizuna). However, the tomato samples were harvested by the KSC veggie team in a different manner (liquid nitrogen) compared to the lettuce and mizuna samples (RNALater). Hence, the tomato samples were not used for further investigation in this proposal.      <P>
In YR1-2: To ensure high-quality metatranscriptomic analysis, a pilot sample of lettuce was used to optimize a protocol for RNA extraction, sample processing, sequencing, bioinformatics pipeline, and metatranscriptomic analysis. Here, a sequencing experiment was done on a portion of the Day 28 lettuce leaf samples. In this experiment, the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer (MinION) was used to analyze the lettuce leaf microbiome. MinION sequencing is the targeted sequencing platform NASA plans to use for future spaceflight sequencing-related experiments. Thus, using the MinION device to sequence the 28-day lettuce leaf microbiome not only enabled us to optimize a protocol for using the MinION to perform quality control surveillance on future space food production; it also enabled us to optimize a bioinformatic pipeline for metatranscriptomic analyses. In addition, further validation can be done when comparing the gold standard Ilumina NOVAseq sequencing method with the new MinION sequencing technology.      <P>
In YR3 of the project, a thorough analysis of the pilot 28-day old lettuce leaf metatranscriptome (performed on the MinION sequencing platform) was completed and a paper was published. [Ed. Note. Reference: Haveman NJ, Khodadad CL, Dixit AR, Louyakis AS, Massa GD, Venkateswaran K, Foster JS. "Evaluating the lettuce metatranscriptome with MinION sequencing for future spaceflight food production applications." npg Microgravity . 2021 Jun;7:22.  <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00151-x.]">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00151-x.]</a>      <P>
In parallel, the full set of 24 lettuce samples (sanitized root and leaf samples at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days old) were sequenced via the Illumina NOVAseq 6000 platform. Sequencing was performed at the University of Florida, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR), and has been completed. The data obtained were run through an optimized bioinformatics pipeline (completed in YR2) and preliminary data for this study were obtained in YR2 as well. The data obtained show that root and leaf samples vary in their differential gene expression profiles and should be analyzed separately. A preliminary analysis of the lettuce leaf and root microbiome at various developmental time points has been established. Further pairwise comparisons between the abundance levels of the microbial communities for each developmental age are currently ongoing.     <P>
Further analysis of the transcriptome was performed in YR3 on this dataset and the differentially expressed genes (DEG) data have been gathered for each of the comparisons. In the data gathered, many more differentially expressed genes were observed in the root samples than in the leaf samples. Results show that the majority of statistically significant DEGs (padj < 0.05) in the roots can be seen in comparisons with Day 28, and therefore suggests that Day 28 has a substantially different metabolic and functional profile than the other developmental time points. In the leaf samples, the same trend was not observed. Although Day14 vs Day 28 showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes, other pairwise comparisons with Day 28 samples did not consistently show a substantial number of DEGs. Further comparisons of the individual genes are still ongoing.     <P>
In addition, a pilot study to optimize the sample processing method for the mizuna plants is ongoing. Findings from YR1 have shown that crop-specific ribosomal probes will need to be designed for the various host organisms to improve the removal of host RNAs and facilitate the microbial RNA enrichment process. In YR2, RNA from 28-day old mizuna leaf tissues have been extracted and several different commercially available ribosomal probes were tested. These samples have been shipped to our collaborator at Cornell University for sequencing, and data obtained will be used to validate the most effective method for enriching the mizuna microbial RNA. Due to COVID-19 and the shortage of laboratory supplies, our mizuna samples were not processed for quite a while. At the end of YR3, the sequencing of these samples for the pilot samples has been completed and data is currently being transferred to the Principal Investigator (PI) for further downstream bioinformatic analyses. The results gathered will identify the best method of removing plant ribosomal probes for future RNAseq library construction.    <P>
Objective 2 – to develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways and signaling leading to plant growth enhancements and/or to plant/human pathogenesis identified from the metatranscriptomic data.    <P>
Major Outcomes:     <P>
The major outcomes of this objective were: 1) The metabolic pathways of the 28-day old lettuce leaf microbiome using MinION sequencing technology have been published. 2) Presence of potential bacterial genera and metabolic activity that could play a role as plant growth enhancers and plant pathogens were revealed. 3) Gene network analysis identified several genes within the fungal Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway that could be drivers of fungal pathogenesis. 4) The metabolic pathways of the lettuce leaf microbiome at all the various time points have been classified.     <P>
Details of work progress: In YR2, we have established the microbial populations found in the 28-day old lettuce leaves and the metabolic pathways that these microbes are utilizing. [Ed. Note. Reference: Haveman NJ, Khodadad CL, Dixit AR, Louyakis AS, Massa GD, Venkateswaran K, Foster JS. "Evaluating the lettuce metatranscriptome with MinION sequencing for future spaceflight food production applications." npg Microgravity. 2021 Jun;7:22.  <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00151-x.]">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-021-00151-x.]</a>     <P>
In YR3, a similar approach was taken to evaluate the metabolic pathways for all the lettuce samples at various time points in their development. By looking at the pairwise comparison of differentially expressed genes for both the bacterial and fungal community, a sense of the pathways changing at each developmental time point can be inferred. The results of the changes in functional pathways of the leaf-bacterial community show that there are many diverse pathways differentially regulated between the 14-day old plants and the 28-day old plants. Genes associated with the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, energy, vitamins and cofactors, replication and repair, and signal transduction are differentially expressed between these two developmental time points. Similar analyses, between the bacterial community in the root tissues, are currently ongoing.     <P>
Objective 3 – to develop methods for enhancing plant growth or suppressing the pathogenic activity without eradicating commensal or saprophytic microbes.    <P>
The results obtained from the 28-day old lettuce leaf microbial metatranscriptome analysis (with the MinION platform) have led to a potential strategy for the suppression of fungal plant pathogens. The taxonomy diversity data revealed the presence of several potential plant growth-promoting bacteria (such as Paenibacillus) and the presence of  fungal plant pathogens (such as Fusarium). Several studies have shown that Paenibacillus produces an antifungal compound that is active against Fusarium. So perhaps, one way to combat the Fusarium presence is to enhance the presence of Paenibacillus in the population.    <P>
Other Projects Developing from this Grant:    <P>
In addition to the proposed project for this fellowship, an additional paper on using the MinION platform as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of an opportunistic fungal pathogen identified on the ISS was developed. [Ed. Note: see bibliography for pre-print information and upcoming print publication date.] In collaboration with Dr. Andrew Schuerger at the Space Life Sciences Lab (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center, a side experiment showing how the MinION platform can be used to accurately differentiate between Fusaria species was performed. The results show that the pipeline could differentiate between the kingdoms and species, and hence, strengthen the case for using the MinION platform as a rapid plant disease diagnostic tool in space.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> A. Project Description - Long-duration exploration in space has emphasized the importance of understanding how to grow plants under microgravity, so as to supply crews with a continuous source of fresh food as well as provide psychological benefits. Plant and animal microbiomes have been known to play a significant role in maintaining host health and development through the regulation of metabolic and immune responses. Therefore, understanding the microbial population associated with plant growth and suppressing multi-host pathogenesis in spaceflight is not only crucial for sustaining the production of edible crops in space but also vital for the safety of crew members. The objective of this ground-based investigation is to develop a refined understanding of the basal plant microbiome of salad crops grown in plant growth chambers under previously used International Space Station (ISS) growth conditions and assess its potential for plant growth enhancements and human pathogenicity. Defining the basal plant microbiome will enable us to understand how spaceflight causes alterations in plant-microbial interactions and how to utilize it for future space exploration efforts. Hence, the overall goal of this project is to determine the influence of microorganisms associated with salad crops in plant growth and protection against pathogenesis under conditions similar to the ISS by utilizing metagenomics and metatranscriptomic approaches. Our central hypothesis is that changes in gene expression within the microbial population are key to understanding whether the plant microbiome can promote the growth of these crops through growth enhancement pathways. To investigate this hypothesis the following objectives were proposed:    <P>
Objective 1 – to define the metatranscriptome of three different crops grown in plant growth chambers under ISS conditions.    <P>
Objective 2 – to develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways and signaling leading to plant growth enhancements and/or to plant/human pathogenesis identified from the metatranscriptomic data.    <P>
Objective 3 – to develop methods for enhancing plant growth or suppressing the pathogenic activity without eradicating commensal or saprophytic microbes.    <P>
B. Significance - The rationale behind this proposal is to advance the technical readiness necessary to support a sustainable source of fresh food production for extraterrestrial exploration, and this will be accomplished by establishing a strong foundation in understanding how plant-microbe interactions impact the safe and successful production of plants. At the completion of these studies, it is expected that information gathered on the basal microbiome of salad crops cultivated in growth chambers similar to environmental conditions on the ISS will identify those microbes that have the potential to result in multi-host pathogenesis. The proposed metatranscriptomic studies, together with the metagenomic studies conducted by the space food production team at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), will help elucidate the functional pathways and mechanisms by which microbes interact with their host under ISS growth conditions. These data will then allow us to make crucial and informed engineering choices on plant growth hardware systems and crop selection for future space exploration vehicles and habitats. Furthermore, this study will provide new insights into standard terrestrial plant biology as little is currently known about the microbiome of salad crops. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> There exists a limited amount of knowledge about how the vast majority of plant-associated microorganisms impacts the plant’s growth, health, and susceptibility to diseases. To date, the interplay between plants and microorganisms has been largely studied for various leaf pathogens, symbiotic rhizobia, and mycorrhizal fungi. However, little is known about the microbiome of salad crops. Salad crops require minimal processing before consumption and are used to investigate the baseline microbial data for developing space-related produce sanitation methods for safe consumption by the crew. So far, microbial studies performed on salad vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, and cilantro, are mostly culture-dependent methods to determine whether human pathogens survive and persist on the edible surface of the leaves. A survey of the salad microbiome and how it plays a role in maintaining the host’s health and development is lacking. Since, investigations conducted in spaceflight have revealed that microgravity does alter the plant-microbe interaction at both the genetic and physiological level with a tendency to increase the susceptibility to plant pathogenesis. It is therefore necessary that a cultivation-independent analysis of the microbial communities found on salad crops be investigated with multi-omics, predominantly metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. <P></td>

Research Progress for each Objective:    <P>
Objective 1 – to define the metatranscriptome of three different crops grown in plant growth chambers under ISS conditions.    <P>
Major Outcomes: In YR2, the major outcomes of this objective were: 1) The 28-day old lettuce metatranscriptome was established using the MinION sequencing platform. 2) Illumina NOVAseq sequencing of all 24 lettuce samples was completed. 3) High-quality RNA has been extracted from Mizuna samples and optimization for sequencing is underway.    <P>
Details of work progress: To ensure high-quality metatranscriptomic analysis, a pilot study of three 28-day old lettuce samples were used to optimize a protocol for RNA extraction, sample processing, sequencing, bioinformatics pipeline, and metatranscriptomic analysis. In YR2 of the project, a thorough analysis of the pilot 28-day old lettuce leaf metatranscriptome was completed and a paper has been submitted for peer review.     <P>
In parallel, the full set of 24 lettuce samples (sanitized root and leaf samples at 7, 14, 21, and 28-days old) were sequenced via the Illumina NOVAseq 6000 platform. Sequencing was performed at the University of Florida, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) and has been completed. The data obtained were run through an optimized bioinformatics pipeline (completed in YR1) and preliminary data were obtained. The principal component analysis of the data shows that root and leaf samples vary in their differential gene expression profile and should be analyzed separately. A preliminary analysis of the lettuce leaf and root microbiome at various developmental time points has been established.    <P>
In addition, a pilot study to optimize the sample processing method for the mizuna plants is on-going. Findings from YR1 have shown that crop-specific ribosomal probes will need to be designed for the various host organisms to improve the removal of host RNAs and facilitate the microbial RNA enrichment process. Hence, RNA from 28-day old Mizuna leaf tissues have been extracted and several different commercially available ribosomal probes were tested. These samples have been shipped to a collaborator at Cornell for sequencing and data obtained will be used to validate the most effective method to enrich for the Mizuna microbial RNA.     <P>
Objective 2 – to develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways and signaling leading to plant growth enhancements and/or to plant/human pathogenesis identified from the metatranscriptomic data.    <P>
Major Outcomes: In YR2, the major outcomes of this objective were: 1) the metabolic pathways of the 28-day old lettuce leaf microbiome have been established, 2) Presence of potential bacterial genera and metabolic activity that could play a role as plant growth enhancers and plant pathogens were revealed, and 3) Gene network analysis identified several genes within the fungal MAPK pathway that could be drivers of fungal pathogenesis.     <P>
Details of work progress: In YR2, we have established the microbial populations found in the 28-day old lettuce leaves and the metabolic pathways that these microbes are utilizing. Based on the 16S and 18S taxonomy results, several bacterial genera identified were potential plant growth-promoting bacteria and fungal plant pathogens. A total of 106 KEGG level 3 pathways were identified in the bacterial population and 85 in the fungal population. Metatranscriptomic analyses of the bacterial and fungal community on 28-day-old lettuce leaf tissues are largely consistent with the core functional microbiome in other phyllosphere microbial systems reported in the literature.      <P>
Within the bacterial heatmap, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation had the highest number of read counts with >4000 counts across all three samples. The top 15 bacterial KEGG level 3 pathways ranked based on the percentage of read counts across the samples against the total read count in all 106 pathways are as follows: Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (47.64%), Oxidative phosphorylation (40.33%), Cell cycle – Caulobacter (1.24%), Ribosome (0.91%), Purine metabolism (0.78%), Pyrimidine metabolism (0.75%), RNA polymerase (0.56%), Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (0.43%), RNA degradation (0.41%), Two-component system (0.33%), Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis (0.32%), Cysteine and methionine metabolism (0.32%), Pyruvate metabolism (0.26%), and Plant-pathogen interaction (0.26%). These top 15 bacterial KEGG level 3 pathways make up 94.28% of the reads assigned to the 106 pathways in the heatmap.     <P>
In the fungal metatranscriptome heatmap, the top 15 KEGG level 3 fungal pathways based on the percentage of read counts across the samples against the total read count in all 85 pathways are as follows: Thermogenesis (30.43%), Oxidative phosphorylation (30.25%), Endocytosis (4.42%), Spliceosome (3.37%), Ribosome (3.19%), Protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (3.17%), MAPK signaling pathway (3.17%), Phospholipase D signaling pathway (1.20%), MAPK signaling pathway - yeast (0.93%), Two-component system (0.74%), Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (0.69%), Oocyte meiosis (0.67%), FoxO signaling pathway (0.63%), Rap1 signaling pathway (0.63%), and Peroxisome (0.62%). These top 15 fungal KEGG level 3 pathways make up 84.11% of the reads assigned to the 85 pathways in the heatmap.    <P>
In the fungal metatranscriptome, about a quarter of all the KEGG level 3 pathways were associated with the signal transduction pathway. Genes within our metatranscriptomic dataset that were mapped to the KEGG database showed the presence of many key genes associated with the MAPK signaling pathway in yeast. These genes also overlap with fungal pathogenesis and it would be beneficial for the crew to monitor these genes over time or under stress.    <P>
Objective 3 – to develop methods for enhancing plant growth or suppressing the pathogenic activity without eradicating commensal or saprophytic microbes.    <P>
In YR2, the results obtained from the 28-day old lettuce leaf microbial metatranscriptome analysis have led to a potential strategy for the suppression of fungal plant pathogens. The taxonomy diversity data revealed the presence of several potential plant growth-promoting bacteria (such as Paenibacillus) and the presence of a couple of fungal plant pathogens (such as Fusarium). Several studies have shown that Paenibacillus produces an antifungal compound that is active against fusarium. So perhaps, one way to combat the fusarium presence is to enhance the presence of paenibacillus in the population. We are investigating different molecular methods to test this hypothesis. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> A. Project Description - Long-duration exploration in space has emphasized the importance of understanding how to grow plants under microgravity, so as to supply crews with a continuous source of fresh food as well as provide psychological benefits. Plant and animal microbiomes have been known to play a significant role in maintaining host health and development through the regulation of metabolic and immune responses. Therefore, understanding the microbial population associated with plant growth and suppressing multi-host pathogenesis in spaceflight is not only crucial for sustaining the production of edible crops in space but also vital for the safety of crew members. The objective of this ground-based investigation is to develop a refined understanding of the basal plant microbiome of salad crops grown in plant growth chambers under previously used International Space Station (ISS) growth conditions and assess its potential for plant growth enhancements and human pathogenicity. Defining the basal plant microbiome will enable us to understand how spaceflight causes alterations in plant-microbial interactions and how to utilize it for future space exploration efforts. Hence, the overall goal of this project is to determine the influence of microorganisms associated with salad crops in plant growth and protection against pathogenesis under conditions similar to the ISS by utilizing metagenomics and metatranscriptomic approaches. Our central hypothesis is that changes in gene expression within the microbial population are key to understanding whether the plant microbiome can promote the growth of these crops through growth enhancement pathways. To investigate this hypothesis the following objectives were proposed:    <P>
Objective 1 – to define the metatranscriptome of three different crops grown in plant growth chambers under ISS conditions.    <P>
Objective 2 – to develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways and signaling leading to plant growth enhancements and/or to plant/human pathogenesis identified from the metatranscriptomic data.    <P>
Objective 3 – to develop methods for enhancing plant growth or suppressing the pathogenic activity without eradicating commensal or saprophytic microbes.    <P>
B. Significance - The rationale behind this proposal is to advance the technical readiness necessary to support a sustainable source of fresh food production for extraterrestrial exploration, and this will be accomplished by establishing a strong foundation in understanding how plant-microbe interactions impact the safe and successful production of plants. At the completion of these studies, it is expected that information gathered on the basal microbiome of salad crops cultivated in growth chambers similar to environmental conditions on the ISS will identify those microbes that have the potential to result in multi-host pathogenesis. The proposed metatranscriptomic studies, together with the metagenomic studies conducted by the space food production team at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), will help elucidate the functional pathways and mechanisms by which microbes interact with their host under ISS growth conditions. These data will then allow us to make crucial and informed engineering choices on plant growth hardware systems and crop selection for future space exploration vehicles and habitats. Furthermore, this study will provide new insights into standard terrestrial plant biology as little is currently known about the microbiome of salad crops. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> There exists a limited amount of knowledge about how the vast majority of plant-associated microorganism impacts the plant’s growth, health, and susceptibility to diseases. To date, the interplay between plants and microorganisms has been largely studied for various leaf pathogens, symbiotic rhizobia, and mycorrhizal fungi. However, little is known about the microbiome of salad crops. Salad crops require minimal processing before consumption and are used to investigate the baseline microbial data for developing space-related produce sanitation methods for safe consumption by the crew. So far, microbial studies performed on salad vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, and cilantro, are mostly culture-dependent methods to determine whether human pathogens survive and persist on the edible surface of the leaves. A survey of the salad microbiome and how it plays a role in maintaining the host’s health and development is lacking. Since, investigations conducted in spaceflight have revealed that microgravity does alter the plant-microbe interaction at both the genetic and physiological level with a tendency to increase the susceptibility to plant pathogenesis. It is therefore necessary that a cultivation-independent analysis of the microbial communities found on salad crops be investigated with multi-omics, predominantly metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. <P></td>

						Objective 1 – to define the metatranscriptome of three different crops grown in plant growth chambers under ISS conditions.    <P>
Major Outcomes: In YR1, the major outcomes of this objective were: 1) the ground-based samples have been collected for all three crops; 2) RNA extraction protocols have been optimized for the lettuce crop; and 3) high-quality RNA has been extracted from the lettuce samples and is ready for sequencing.    <P>
Details of work progress: In YR1 of the project, the veggie team at Kennedy Space Centre (KSC) completed the growth of all three crops (Lettuce, Tomato, and Mizuna). All samples with three biological replicates were harvested at the respective time points and stored in RNAlater. Samples were transferred to the Foster lab at SLSL and kept in the -80°C until ready for RNA extraction.  To ensure high quality metatranscriptomic analysis, a pilot sample of lettuce was used to optimize a protocol for RNA extraction, sample processing, sequencing, bioinformatics pipeline, and metatranscriptomic analysis. RNA from all sanitized lettuce samples (roots and leaves) were extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy mini plant kit. DNA digestion was performed on column as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The quantity of RNA from the samples was analyzed with Qubit and the quality of RNA was analyzed with the Aglient Bioanalyzer 6000.     <P>
Lettuce samples were sent to the University of Florida, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) for library prep and sequencing on the NOVAseq 6000. Those samples will be fragmented to 150 bp and paired end reads will be sequenced on one lane of the S4 flowcell on the Illumina NOVAseq 6000 machine. A sample processing protocol has been established and we are currently awaiting the sequencing to be completed.     <P>
A parallel sequencing experiment was done on a portion of the Day 28 lettuce leaf samples. In this experiment, the oxford nanopore minion sequencer was used to analyze the lettuce leaf microbiome. MinION sequencing is the targeted sequencing platform NASA plans to use for future spaceflight sequencing-related experiments. Thus, using the minion to sequence the 28-day lettuce leaf microbiome will not only enable us to optimize a protocol for using the minion to perform quality control surveillance on future space food production but also enables us to optimize a bioinformatic pipeline for metatranscriptomic analyses. In addition, further validation can be done when comparing the gold standard Ilumina NOVAseq sequencing method with the new minion sequencing technology.      <P>
Objective 2 – to develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways and signaling leading to plant growth enhancements and/or to plant/human pathogenesis identified from the metatranscriptomic data.    <P>
Major Outcomes: In YR1, the major outcomes of this objective were: 1) a bioinformatics pipeline has been established for microbial metatranscriptomic analyses; 2) microbial taxonomy diversity can be identified using the 16S rRNA from sequenced RNA; and 3) the metatranscriptome of the lettuce leaf microbiome revealed potential metabolic activity that could play a role as plant growth enhancers.    <P>
Details of work progress: In YR1, we have a preliminary understanding of the microbial populations found in the 28-day old lettuce leaves and the metabolic pathways that these microbes are utilizing. Based on the results, majority of the 16S rRNA gene sequences shared similarity with Proteobacteria and approximately 25% of the metatranscriptome is associated with metabolic pathways, such as carbon, sulfur, fatty acid and nucleotide metabolism. Further, analyses will help identify key players in plant growth enhancements and/or plant/human pathogenesis.    <P>
Objective 3 – to develop methods for enhancing plant growth or suppressing the pathogenic activity without eradicating commensal or saprophytic microbes.    <P>
In YR1, further analyses are required in objective 2 in order to address the goals of objective 3. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> We will determine the influence of microorganisms associated with salad crop (lettuce, mizuna, and tomato) in plant growth and protection against pathogenesis under conditions similar to the International Space Station (ISS) by utilizing metagenomics and metatranscriptomic approaches. Long-duration exploration in space has emphasized the importance of understanding how to grow plants under microgravity, so as to supply crews with a continuous source of fresh food as well as provide psychological benefits. In 2015, Zinnia hybrida grown in the Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE) on board the ISS was infected by an opportunistic fungal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum. The pathogenic strains of F. oxysporum causes Fusarium wilt, which is lethal, swift, and causes diseases in nearly every agriculturally important crop. In addition, in immunocompromised patients such as astronauts, this multihost pathogen can cause invasive fungal infections. Therefore, understanding the microbial population associated with plant growth and the molecular aspects of suppressing multihost pathogenesis in spaceflight is not only crucial for sustaining the production of edible crops in space but also vital for the safety of crew members. The objective of this ground-based investigation is to develop a refined understanding of the basal plant microbiome of salad crops grown in plant growth chambers under previously used ISS growth conditions and assess its potential for plant growth enhancements and human pathogenicity. Defining the basal plant microbiome will enable us to understand how spaceflight causes alterations in plant-microbial interactions and how to utilize it for future space exploration efforts. The long-term goal of this research is to develop countermeasures, biotic or transgenic, necessary to allow a safe and sustainable human presence in space.     <P>
  The plant-microbial interaction can be categorized into three extreme relationships, pathogenic, parasitic, or mutualistic, and microorganisms can have several different relationships with plants during their life cycles. It is well known that environmental stresses can result in the change in relationship between the host and a microorganism. Investigations in spaceflight revealed that microgravity does alter the plant-microbe interaction at both the genetic and physiological level with tendencies to result in an increased susceptibility to plant pathogenesis. The plant microbiome can directly affect the human microbiome through environmental interactions or ingestion of raw plants, hence extensive tests will be conducted to determine the basal plant microbiome of salad crops grown in growth chambers under previously used ISS conditions.     <P>
  As part of developing future space food production, this proposal will collaborate with Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in investigating the plant-microbiome interaction. Lettuce, mizuna, and tomato seeds grown in growth chambers under previously used ISS conditions will be harvested at different developmental stages and microbial activity will be tracked with metatranscriptomics. Any space food production-associated microbial activity will be assessed for both plant growth enhancing compounds and multi-host pathogenicity using molecular methods. The results generated could also be used to drive future hardware modifications.      <P>
  The overall goal of our program is to understand the scope of beneficial microbial activity and pathogenicity in salad crops that are the current emphasis for establishing a sustainable production of fresh food on board the ISS. The current proposal for ground-based research leading to spaceflight addresses an important gap in knowledge listed in the research element of plant microbial biology. Specifically, "How can horticultural approaches for sustained production of edible crops in space be both improved and implemented?" <P></td>
