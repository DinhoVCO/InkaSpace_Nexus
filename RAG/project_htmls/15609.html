Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent "omics" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth. <P></td>

						OVERVIEW:     <P>
  This research has used microgravity analogs to test hypotheses about plant responses to reduced gravity generated from the previous plant-focused spaceflight research campaigns of Biological Research in Canisters-16 (BRIC-16) and Advanced Plant Experiments-03 (APEX-03-1). BRIC-16 and APEX-03-1 revealed that microgravity had a profound effect on root growth directionality, cell wall structure and composition, and the expression of a suite of root-specific genes involved in regulating cell wall function. Moreover, this research implicated the actin cytoskeleton as a major player in modulating root growth in microgravity. These observations led to the overarching hypothesis tested in this current research project that microgravity modifies root growth directionality in large part by modifying the expression of genes that link the actin cytoskeleton to structural remodeling of the cell wall. To test this hypothesis the following specific aims were pursued:    <P>
  Specific Aim 1. Immunocytochemistry of selected cell wall components in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) seedlings grown on the clinostat to simulate a microgravity environment.      <P>
Specific Aim 2. Characterizing autotropic root straightening in maize roots in response to brassinolide (BL) - and latrunculin B (LatB) - induced actin disruption.     <P>
Specific Aim 3. Evaluation of root growth of selected Arabidopsis thaliana actin/cell wall-related mutants grown in simulated microgravity generated through clinorotation.    <P>
  RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS:     <P>
  SPECIFIC AIM 1. Immunocytochemistry of selected cell wall components in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on a slowly rotating clinostat. Status: completed.    <P>
The APEX-03 experiment grew plants on the International Space Station for either 6 or 11 days. These samples were returned for glycomic analysis of cell wall polymer composition. Glycomics uses enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify non-cellulosic cell wall polymer levels via a battery of monoclonal antibodies raised against specific cell wall components. APEX-03 also returned fixed materials allowing for confirmation of the ELISA results using immunocytochemistry. Xyloglucans are the most common hemicellulose in dicot cell walls and the glycomics provided a survey-level monitoring of wall composition that highlighted xyloglucans as likely being modified in spaceflight.     <P>
To validate these results, 22 of the monoclonal antibodies that recognized a range of wall polymers including xyloglucan, xylan, and arabinogalactan epitopes were chosen from the glycomics analysis. These antibodies were then used for immunocytochemistry to localize where these polymers were likely to be changing. These analyses revealed the spatial patterning underlying the spaceflight-triggered changes suggested by the glycomics survey. For example, the XG-4 non-fucosylated-xyloglucan recognized by antibody M58 was found to be most intensely deposited in the periphery of the spaceflight-grown roots, whereas the xylan backbone epitope recognized by antibody M140 was more intensely labeled in the xylem of space-grown roots. These results suggest that the spaceflight environment triggers changes in xyloglucan-related polymer production, where distinct spatial patterning of their production is an important element of the response (Nakashima et al., 2023).    <P>
The samples used for glycomics were also used to extract RNA for parallel transcriptomic profiling. Analysis of this APEX-03 RNAseq data was made using the iDEP2.1 platform with a false discovery rate set to <0.05 and a fold-change cutoff of 1.5x. This study revealed distinctly different spaceflight-responsive transcriptome profiles of root versus shoot tissues that changed in the plants sampled at day 11 compared to those harvested at day 6. Gene ontology enrichment analysis highlighted cell walls as a likely important element of these transcriptional responses     <P>
The glycomics results from aim 1 showed change in xyloglucan-related wall polymers is triggered by growth in spaceflight. However, analysis of the expression patterns of the 13 genes that form the xyloglucan biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis from the APEX-03 RNAseq data do not support the hypothesis that transcriptional regulation of this pathway explains these changes in cell wall biochemistry. It is likely that spaceflight is altering cell wall structure through effects on post-transcriptional regulatory events.    <P>
  SPECIFIC AIM 2. Characterize autotropic root straightening in maize roots in response to brassinolide (BL)- and latrunculin B (LatB)-induced actin disruption. Status: completed at the Noble Research Institute.     <P>
This research revealed that the plant hormone, epi-Brassinolide (eBL) is involved in autotropic root straightening post gravistimulation through its effects on F-actin in roots of maize (Zea mays). Treatment with eBL resulted in the over-shooting of the bending of roots after a gravity stimulus was removed by placing the plants on the clinostat. This effect was caused by clinorotation-linked disruption of F-actin organization and dynamics. This outcome was published in the journal, Frontiers in Plant Science (de Bang et al., 2020). This work has also led to the development of live cell actin reporters in M. truncatula. Plants were genetically engineered to stably express Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP that produced high quality labeling of the actin cytoskeleton in roots and leaves with minimal disruption in overall growth. These transgenic lines were then used to study the effect of eBL on F-actin in M. truncatula root cells (de Bang et al., 2020). Additionally, methods have been developed for live cell imaging of F-actin reporters in A. thaliana and M. truncatula that were published as a chapter in the book, Cytoskeleton Methods and Protocol (Chai et al., 2022).

  SPECIFIC AIM 3. Evaluate root growth of selected Arabidopsis thaliana actin/cell wall-related mutants on microgravity simulators. Status: completed.     <P>
Three recessive, non-allelic actin-related mutants have been isolated from a T-DNA mutagenized population of A. thaliana in a forward genetic screen for increased sensitivity of root growth inhibition to LatB. This research avenue started in previous NASA-funded research, Gramt #NNX12AM94G, to find novel players in actin-regulated root growth by searching for LatB hypersensitivity. These mutants were named hypersensitive to LatB (hlb) 1, 2, and 3. The hlb1 mutation was mapped to a gene of unknown function that encoded a protein with a six tetratricopeptide repeat motif structure during the previous funding. Analyses characterized it to have functions in modulation of actin dynamics at the trans-Golgi network/ early endosome, resulting in a publication in The Plant Cell (Sparks et al., 2016). Continuing this work, the hlb3 mutation has now been mapped to exon 2 of the gene, FORMIN HOMOLOGY 20 that is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. This work involved using a new tool, TDNAscan, that demonstrated improved accuracy in the identification of complete and truncated T-DNA insertions, and was published in Frontiers in Genetics (Sun et al., 2019). The hlb2 mutation has now also been mapped to the gene, SPIRRIG (SPI). Characterization of its function showed it played a key role in the regulation of root hair elongation by maintaining F-actin dynamics at the site of active root hair growth (Chin et al., 2021).    <P>
In parallel studies to the LatB hypersensitive mutants, analyses have been performed on the effect of growth in simulated microgravity on root growth and orientation of actin mutants: act2-3, act7-4, act8-4, act2-3 act8-2, along with knockout mutants in SPI. Simulated microgravity was generated using custom-built 2-D clinostats. Previous research has shown that mutants in ACT2 consistently showed strong root skewing and coiling responses in spaceflight during BRIC-16 (Nakashima et al., 2014). This current analysis has further revealed that ACT2 (and potentially SPI) as a key player, required for the inhibition of root growth and enhanced skewing triggered by growth in simulated microgravity on the clinostat.    <P>
  IN SUMMARY, the major findings from this research have been: (1) Spaceflight is associated with a remodeling of the plant cell wall with major effects on xyloglucan polymer levels likely controlled at the post-transcriptional level; (2) The actin cytoskeleton is a major driver of root elongation and gravity-driven directional growth, with key roles for actin isoform 2 and the SPIRRIG protein; (3) Root straightening after gravstimulation is regulated through brassinosteroid and actin-dependent processes.    <P>

Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent "omics" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth. <P></td>

						This grant is a continuation of NASA grant 80NSSC18K1462, which was transferred from the Noble Research Institute to the University of Wisconsin (80NSSC21K0029) in November 2022. Research accomplishments since the grant was transferred to Wisconsin are outlined below. Remaining experiments are related to aims 1 and 3. Experiments in aim 2 were completed at the Noble Research Institute.    <P>
Specific Aim 1. Immunocytochemistry of selected cell wall components in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on a slowly rotating clinostat and random positioning machine (RPM). Status: In progress.    <P>
For this reporting period, research has prioritized completing and validating the glycomics and cell wall immunocytochemistry of seedlings from the Advanced Plant Experiments / APEX-03 experiments. Glycomics uses a panel of several hundred antibodies against non-cellulosic cell wall polymers to define the cell wall composition on the plant. Analysis has been completed of the cell wall changes elicited by spaceflight, as part of the APEX-03 experiment, using this glycomics profiling approach. This analysis provided a survey-level monitoring of wall composition that highlighted xyloglucans as a major wall polymer being modified in spaceflight. Monoclonal antibodies that recognized xyloglucan, xylan, and arabinogalactan epitopes were then further analyzed by immunocytochemistry to ask where within the plant these changes occurred. This approach showed that, e.g., the xylan backbone epitope recognized by antibody M140 was more intensely labeled in the xylem of space-grown roots than in ground-controls. Similarly, the M2-xyloglucan recognized by antibody M58 was more intense in the periphery of the spaceflight-grown roots. These results suggest that the spaceflight environment may trigger root secondary cell wall formation and modulate xyloglucan-related polymer production.     <P>
This research used the high alkaline extracts from RNA purification columns as the input samples. RNA purification usually separates and then discards these cell wall fractions to purify the nucleic acids for subsequent sequencing. Therefore, this glycomics analysis from the column waste of RNA purification may add value to the transcriptomics analyses already used for plant spaceflight experiments.    <P>
However, as this represents a new approach to cell wall sample preparation, validation is essential and was performed using identical extraction procedures on mutants defective in known aspects of cell wall chemistry: xxt1/xxt2 and mur3. The xxt1/xxt2 mutant has no xyloglucan, while the mur3-3 mutant contains cell wall xyloglucans that lack a galactose-fucose side chain. Root tissues of the mutants displayed the expected reduction in fucosylated xygloglucan, indicating this analysis of RNA extraction column residue is likely a robust approach to the monitoring of cell wall composition in spaceflight samples, even those already processed for RNA extraction. These findings have been published in NpjMicroavity in March of 2023. [Ed. Note: See Bibliography.]    <P>
Specific Aim 2. Characterize autotropic root straightening in maize roots in response to brassinolide (BL) - and latrunculin B (LatB) - induced actin disruption. Status: Completed at the Noble Research Institute.    <P>
Specific Aim 3. Evaluate root growth of selected Arabidopsis thaliana actin single and double mutants, and peroxidase mutants on microgravity simulators. Status: In progress.    <P>
The responses of Col (wild type), spi5 (hlb2), act2-3, act7-4, act8-2, act2-3, act8-2 plants have been analyzed for their responses to growth on microgravity simulators. Actins 2, 7, and 8 are the major vegetative actins in Arabidposis and are thought to generate specific subsets of the microfilament arrays of the plant cell. SPIRIG was identified as an actin-related gene in a screen for hypersensitivity to the actin disrupting compound latrunculin. Actin 7 mutants showed low germination and severely delayed growth and development, and so were excluded from further analyses due to this pleiotropic phenotype. Wild-type plants showed significant root skewing, when grown on the clinostat, when compared to 1 x g controls. The act2 and act8 single mutants also skewed, whereas the act2-3/act8-2 double and spi5 mutant did not suggesting a potential effect on actin-dependent growth responses entrained to gravity.  <P>

Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent "omics" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth. <P></td>

						This grant is a continuation of NASA grant 80NSSC18K1462, which was transferred from the Noble Research Institute to the University of Wisconsin. Research accomplishments since the grant was transferred to Wisconsin are outlined below. Remaining experiments are related to aims 1 and 3. Experiments in aim 2 were completed at the Noble Research Institute.    <P>
Specific Aim 1. Immunocytochemistry of selected cell wall components in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown on a slowly rotating clinostat and random positioning machine (RPM). Status: in progress.    <P>
Seedlings from experiments growing plants on 3d clinostats at the Microgravity Simulation Support Facility (MSSF) at NASA Kennedy Space Center are currently stored in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) or embedded in London Resin (LR) White Resin, awaiting sectioning and immunolabeling. However, for this reporting period, we have prioritized completing the glycomics and immunocytochemistry of seedlings from the previous APEX-03 Arabidopsis flight experiment. This data will then guide our work on immunocytochemistry of the seedlings grown on microgravity analogs. Glycomics uses a panel of >100 antibodies against wall components to define wall composition. The data we have collected on glycomics and immunocytochemistry from APEX-03 showed differences in the abundance of non-cellulosic cell wall components between ground- and space-grown seedlings. Glycomics revealed that spaceflight induced a general increase in non-cellulosic wall components based on high binding intensity of monoclonal antibodies to wall components from the space-grown seedlings. Immunocytochemistry of 11-day-old seedlings roots validated results from the glycomics readout. The cell wall components that changed in spaceflight will be used for immunocytochemistry of seedlings grown on a 3-D clinostat and RPM to determine if these microgravity analogs mirror spaceflight conditions.     <P>
Specific Aim 2. Characterize autotropic root straightening in maize roots in response to brassinolide (BL) - and latrunculin B (LatB) - induced actin disruption. Status: completed at the Noble Research Institute.    <P>
Specific Aim 3. Evaluate root growth of selected Arabidopsis thaliana actin single and double mutants, and peroxidase mutants on microgravity simulators. Status: in progress.     During this reporting period, progress was made in characterizing actin cytoskeletal-related mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. One significant accomplishment is the characterization of a mutant that is resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of the actin-disrupting compound LatB. The rationale for this aim is based on the observation that LatB enhances root gravitropism by inhibiting autotropic root straightening. Therefore, we expect that mutants that are hypersensitive or resistant to LatB could shed light into actin-mediated root development in microgravity. Progress to date is primarily on mutants that are hypersensitive to LatB (i.e., the hlb mutants). Previous publications described the characterization of these hlb mutants and identification of the disrupted genes that confer LatB hypersensitivity. Proteins encoded by the HLB genes include a trans-Golgi Network (TGN)-localized protein involved in exocytosis and endocytosis, a BEACH-domain containing protein called SPIRRIG (SPI) that functions in actin-mediated root hair growth, and the actin-nucleating class II formin 20.     <P>
For this reporting period, we completed the characterization of one LatB-resistant mutant (hereafter referred to as LBR1). In the absence of LatB, LBR1 and wild type have similar root growth phenotypes. However, when three-day-old wild type and LBR1 seedlings were transferred to Murashige-Skoog (MS) plates supplemented with a range of LatB concentrations, it was found that LBR1 primary root length was longer than that of wild type. Robust primary root growth in LBR1 was observed even at LatB concentrations that severely inhibited that of wild type. The ability of LBR1 to tolerate the inhibitory effects of LatB was also observed in other organs and cell types. For instance, hypocotyls of dark-grown LBR1 mutants incubated in LatB-supplemented MS plates were significantly longer than those of wild type. Furthermore, LBR1 root hairs still emerged at LatB concentrations that typically blocked root hair initiation in wild type.    <P>
The ability of LBR1 to tolerate the inhibitory effects of LatB led to the hypothesis that the LBR1 actin cytoskeleton remains intact even when exposed to LatB. To test this hypothesis, stable lines of LBR1 expressing the filamentous-actin (F-actin) reporter, UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP were generated. F-actin in wild type and LBR1 primary roots was examined two days after transferring seedlings to 100 nM LatB. At 100 nM LatB, F-actin networks in LBR1 primary roots remained dense, while wild type exhibited fragmented F-actin. The data indicate that the actin cytoskeleton of LBR1 is more resistant than that of wild type to LatB, and therefore consistent with the ability of LBR1 seedlings to grow at LatB concentrations that severely inhibit the wild type. A cross between LBR1 and wild type resulted in progeny that exhibited resistance to LatB, which indicated that LBR1 is a dominant mutant.    <P>
To determine the identity of the LBR1 gene, whole genome sequencing comparison between lbr1 mutant and wild type plants was conducted. This revealed that LBR1 had a mutation in the AT5G09810 gene which encodes ACTIN7 (ACT7), which is one of three vegetative actin isoforms in Arabidopsis. To confirm if LBR1 is ACT7, LBR1 plants were transformed with wild type ACT7 under the control of the ACT7 promoter (pACT7:ACT7). Furthermore, wild type plants were transformed with the mutated LBR1 under control of the ACT7 promoter (pACT7:LBR1). Results showed that LBR1 mutants expressing pACT7:ACT7 exhibited wild type sensitivity to LatB, while wild type plants expressing pACT7:LBR1 became LatB resistant. The data confirm that LBR1 is ACT7.    <P>
During this reporting period, we also completed genetic interaction studies between SPI/HLB2 and components of the ARP2/3-W/SCR pathway. Mutations in SPI/HLB2 lead to short root hairs and hypersensitivity to LatB. SPI/HLB2 mutants also have mild trichome shape defects. Because SPI/HLB2 mutants partly resemble mutants to the actin-nucleating WAVE/SCAR-ARP2/3 complex, we hypothesized that SPI/HLB2 might function in overlapping genetic pathways as WAVE/SCAR-ARP2/3 in actin-mediated plant cell development. We tested this hypothesis by generating double mutants between SPI/HLB2 and WAVE/SCAR-ARP2/3, and analyzed their root hairs, trichomes, and primary root sensitivity to LatB. For LatB sensitivity assays, we found that primary roots of arp2, arp3, arpc5, and brk1 exhibited some hypersensitivity to LatB. However, the response of these mutants to LatB was not as severe as spi and leaned more toward wild type sensitivity. By contrast, the hypersensitivity of primary roots of spi arp2, spi arp3, spi arpc5 and spi brk1 double mutants to LatB was more similar to spi suggesting genetic interactions occurs between SPI/HLB2 and W/SCR-ARP2/3.     <P>
Genetic interaction between SPI/HLB2 and W/SRC-ARP2/3 was also observed in trichomes. Consistent with previous reports, arp2, arp3, arpc5 and brk1 had more severe trichome shape defects than that of wild type and spi, while those of spi were mild when viewed with a scanning electron microscope. Arp2, arp3, arpc5, and brk1 trichomes had distinctively shorter branches than that of wild type and spi/hlb2. Whereas trichomes of spi were wavy and crooked, they were not short as those of arp2, arp3, arpc5, and brk1. We found that trichomes of all the double mutants resembled those of spi/hlb2, which provided further validation that SPI functions in overlapping genetic pathways as WAVE/SCAR-ARP2/3. We also completed experiments on imaging the actin cytoskeleton in developing trichomes of spi/hlb2 mutants. Data showed that actin organization in spi/hlb2 trichomes was similar to that of wild type, which was consistent with the mild trichome defects of spi/hlb2. <P>

Plants will be a major component of advanced life support systems to enable NASA to realize its vision of long duration space exploration that will take humans to Mars and beyond. However, plants can only be effectively used for such systems if we have a deeper mechanistic understanding about how their development is regulated by the spaceflight environment. Recent "omics" studies have shown that plants reprogram their genetic circuitry when grown in the near weightless conditions of space. Genes involved in cell wall remodeling and oxidative stress are major gene categories that are differentially regulated by microgravity. Further, it has been shown that microgravity in space and simulated microgravity using clinostats or random positioning machines elicit roughly similar root skewing responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Root skewing was more pronounced in mutants to a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform. Consistent with the enhanced root skewing of actin mutants in microgravity is the observation that other plant species such as maize (Zea mays L.) have stronger root directional growth responses on a clinostat when chemicals such as latrunculin B disrupt their actin cytoskeleton. Based on these observations, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a key player in dictating root growth directionality in microgravity and simulated microgravity by regulating the process of autotropic organ straightening. Moreover, we hypothesize that a set of cell wall cross-linking (i.e., class III peroxidases) and putative actin-regulatory proteins (i.e., HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1) mediate root hair elongation and directional root growth, respectively, under microgravity and simulated microgravity. Our hypotheses will be addressed through three specific aims including the analysis of cell wall composition/distribution in wild-type Arabidopsis roots, and detailed characterization of selected Arabidopsis cell wall and actin mutants subjected to microgravity simulation on a slow rotating clinostat and random position machine (aim 1 and 3). We will also use microgravity simulators to address the hypothesis that the plant hormone brassinolide regulates directional root growth in maize through its modulation of actin organization and dynamics (aim 2). Our research plan builds on successes of previous NASA-funded ground and spaceflight results, and outlines a comprehensive set of experiments including cell wall immunocytochemistry, computer-based root growth analyses, actin quantification, and genetics. The proposed work aligns with Plant Biology (PB) Element of the Space Biology Science Plan. Results obtained from plant experiments on microgravity simulators will address guiding questions linked to the decadal survey recommendations including the impact of gravity on plant growth, development and metabolism (PB-1), and molecular mechanisms underlying how plants sense and react to gravity (PB-5). We expect that the proposed research will provide us with basic knowledge that will guide the development of plant cultivars better adapted to the microgravity environment of spaceflight, an outcome that will prove beneficial for the design of plant habitats on future space colonies and for addressing great agricultural challenges on Earth. <P></td>

A primary focus of the proposed work is to ask how the microgravity environment modulates the directionality of root growth. Because roots are essential for the uptake of water and nutrients, knowledge gained from successful implementation of the proposed work will be crucial in guiding pre-breeding efforts aimed toward the development of crops with improved productivity through better and more efficient root systems. Thus, agriculture on Earth is one beneficial outcome of this project. <P></td>
