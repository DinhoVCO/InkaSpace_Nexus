                    <td colspan="3"> Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:     <P>
(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.    <P>
(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.    <P>
The BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants. <P></td>

						The flight component of this project is awaiting the availability of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware and an associated flight opportunity. Fresh seed stocks have been maintained and validated for all the genotypes for the experiment and are regularly being tested for germination and growth characteristics to be ready for a potential flight opportunity.    <P>
Work has continued to characterize how spaceflight conditions such as hypoxic stress might be influencing plant defense capabilities. Flooding stress and hypoxia are thought to be important elements of the plant spaceflight environment due to the loss of both gravity-driven water flow and buoyancy-driven convection in the microgravity of space. On Earth, flooding stress is thought to lead to shifts in defense capabilities against pathogens, priming the plant to defend itself more effectively once the flooding stress has subsided. Additionally, flooding is thought to suppress responses to herbivory and mechanical damage. Previous spaceflight data from the Advanced Plant Experiments-05 (APEX-05) experiment have been analyzed and combined with ground-based studies. Previous work has shown that when the CAX2 vacuolar Ca2+ transporter is knocked out, plants become resistant to flooding stress on Earth. These same CAX2 knockouts were grown on the International Space Station (the APEX-05 flight experiment). Analysis of patterns of gene expression from the APEX-05 data indicated that the wild type plants exhibited molecular signatures of hypoxia and oxidative stress while growing in space. These changes were coupled to alterations in patterns of gene expression associated with response to both pathogen-attack and physical damage, or herbivory effects that were not seen in the cax2 mutant. Ground-based experiments showed that a hypoxic stress of ~6% oxygen can mimic many of these spaceflight-related events.     <P>
An additional major effect of spaceflight on the cax2 mutant was a large-scale shift in patterns of gene expression towards those related to cell wall biogenesis, maintenance, and remodeling in the shoot. Glycome profiling was therefore used to catalog cell wall polymer composition. Glycomics uses a suite of monoclonal antibodies to quantify the non-cellulosic cell wall polymer composition through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay. This profiling revealed spaceflight-triggered increases in wall polymers such as xyloglucans and pectins in both wild type and the cax2 mutant. However, a notable difference between the two genotypes was that, in wild type, spaceflight induced upregulation of the xylan components of the wall in only roots; whereas in the cax2 mutant, this change was shifted to being exclusively in the shoot tissues. The xylan content of the wall plays a key role in both structural support and in maintaining a resilient physical barrier for plant defense, indicating a likely major shift in these features is being elicited by growth in space. These results further suggest that the regulatory networks governing these changes to the wall are strongly influenced by the action of the CAX2 gene, potentially through its role in Ca2+-based signaling of hypoxic stress. <P>

Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity.

Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.    <P>
(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.    <P>
The BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight. <P></td>

						OVERVIEW    <P>
Analysis of the available plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins. These observations suggest plants may exhibit altered defense responses in the spaceflight environment, which would have important practical implications for using plants as part of a bioregenerative life support system. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. This Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED)-based research seeks to answer this question using Arabidopsis thaliana as the model plant species. Wild type Arabidopsis and mutants in two defense-related genes will be grown in the BRIC-LED hardware and treated with the bacterial elicitor flg22 to trigger defense signaling. Samples will then be analyzed for alterations in patterns of gene expression linked to defense signaling by comparison to ground controls. The results from this experiment should directly address the critical question of whether plant defense responses are compromised during spaceflight.    <P>
  PROGRESS    <P>
1.	The flight component of this project has been awaiting the availability of the BRIC-LED hardware and an associated flight opportunity. After a successful functional test, the BRIC-LED facility is now ready for use and an Experiment Verification Test (EVT) has been scheduled (currently for October 2024). Fresh seed stocks have been maintained for all the genotypes for the experiment and are regularly being tested for germination and growth characteristics to be ready for the EVT and a potential flight in 2025.    <P>
  2.	In parallel to preparing for the flight, experiments have been ongoing to characterize how spaceflight conditions such as hypoxic stress might be influencing plant defense capabilities, using a combination of ground-based studies and analysis of previous spaceflight data. Spaceflight is thought to impose hypoxic conditions on biology due to the loss of convection in the microgravity environment. Bakshi et al., (2023) details an analysis of ground-based studies of mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana where the gene for the CAX2 vacuolar Ca2+ transporter had been knocked out. This work showed these mutants were resistant to waterlogging stress, likely due to constitutive activation of their natural hypoxia tolerance system. Previously, CAX2 knockouts have been flown in the Advanced Plant Experiments-05 (APEX-05) flight experiment, where Arabidopsis plants were grown on the International Space Station. The data from this flight experiment have been further investigated and have revealed a potential link between spaceflight-induced hypoxic stress and altered plant defense capabilities.    <P>
In these APEX-05 plants, wild type showed an inhibition of root and shoot growth in space, whereas CAX2 knockouts already exhibited this phenotype on the ground and showed no further effects when grown in spaceflight. Transcriptome analyses, using both RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indicate that the wild type plants exhibited molecular signatures of having experienced hypoxia and oxidative stress while growing in space. These same plants showed a disruption in the expression of genes related to defense signaling in both roots and shoots. Neither the hypoxic signature, nor the defense disruption were observed in the CAX2 mutant lines, where alterations in cell wall-related transcripts in the shoots was the only significant response.    <P>
Further investigation of the ground controls for this experiment shows that the CAX2 mutants showed down-regulation of both hypoxic response and defense-related genes on the ground, in comparison to wild type plants also grown on the ground. These observations suggest knocking out CAX2 constitutively suppresses both hypoxic and defense responses, implying these pathways may be linked. Indeed, flooding stress and its related hypoxic conditions are now recognized as likely leading to shifts in defense capabilities (García et al., 2024) with, e.g., hypoxia-linked defense priming thought to ready the plant for increased pathogen attacks associated with flooding and post-flooding stresses (Hsu et al., 2013). Conversely, flooding has been proposed to suppress the jasmonic acid-related anti-herbivory network (Rehman et al., 2023), implying a broad spectrum of effects on the plant’s ability to defend itself. Ground-based experiments growing wild type and CAX2 mutants in chambers, where the ambient oxygen levels can be controlled, indicate these changes seen in spaceflight are mimicked at ~6% oxygen levels. This level of hypoxia is consistent with previous research, where a similar level of hypoxic stress can copy the effects of spaceflight on the oxidative stress responses in Arabidopsis (Choi et al., 2019). Current work is using ground-based experiments to ask if this level of hypoxic stress leads to a compromised ability to trigger immune responses and whether the CAX2 mutants are less susceptible to this effect.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:     <P>
(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.    <P>
(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.    <P>
The BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants. <P></td>

						The flight component of this project is currently waiting on the availability of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware and flight opportunities. Fresh seed stocks are being maintained for all the genotypes for the experiment.    <P>
Meanwhile an analysis of the metadata associated with all the plant spaceflight data deposited at NASA GeneLab has been completed. Details including hardware, genotype, and experimental design were curated into a data matrix that was then analyzed for similarities between experiments. The similarity score matrix was then used to define highly similar or dissimilar experiments for comparison of their transcriptomic signatures. This analysis showed that assay type (microarray versus RNA-seq) and hardware for the experiment (especially its lighting) were factors that had significant effects on transcriptional patterns that can obscure the spaceflight versus ground control comparisons. Once these variables were accounted for, spaceflight effects on patterns of gene expression related to defense, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and cell wall modifications were detected.     <P>
Spaceflight is thought to impose hypoxic conditions on biology due to the loss of convection in the microgravity environment. Bioinformatics was performed on plant gene expression datasets to pinpoint potential hypoxia-related response genes that might be altered by spaceflight. This analysis highlighted the vacuolar Ca2+ pump CAX2 and the ER-localized Ca2+-pumping ATPase ACA1 as strong candidates. Analysis of the low oxygen and flooding response of mutants in both genes found that knockout of CAX2 in particular leads to resistance to both flooding and hypoxic challenge. Further, analysis of patterns of gene expression indicates that many of the hypoxia-triggered genes seen in wild type plants are unaffected by this stress in the CAX2 mutants, whereas a subset of these genes is constitutively upregulated in the CAX2 lines even without hypoxic challenge.    <P>
These upregulated genes are related to the processing of lactic acid, a key byproduct of metabolism under low oxygen conditions. These results have led to a model whereby knocking out CAX2 leads to preadaptation to low oxygen stress and so to increased tolerance to hypoxic environments. The CAX2 mutants should therefore show resistance to growing under spaceflight conditions. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:     <P>
(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.    <P>
(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.    <P>
The BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants. <P></td>

						The project is currently waiting on the availability of the BRIC-LED hardware and flight opportunities. Fresh seed stocks are being maintained for all the genotypes for the experiment.    <P>
Meanwhile, progress has been made on analysis of the metadata associated with all the plant spaceflight data deposited at the NASA GeneLab. These data include details about experiment design, hardware, and biological samples and have been curated as a data matrix. The similarities between datasets have then been mapped and the correlations between each set of transcriptomics data further correlated with all the other datasets from the experiments, such as available datasets on patterns of gene expression to reveal patterns of response.     <P>
This analysis has highlighted assay type (microarray versus RNA-seq) and lighting regime as key variables that need to be controlled for -- to help reveal spaceflight-related patterns in the data. This study has also reinforced the conclusions that oxidative stress and cell wall modifications are key elements of the spaceflight response in plants, showing up in the transcriptomic profiles of multiple spaceflight experiments. Detailed analysis of the publicly available results in GeneLab of experiments performed in the BRIC hardware on Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings has revealed some core response genes (HSP101, ABS4, COR78, PRX39, AAP2 and MAGL4) as being commonly regulated across these spaceflight experiments. Most of these genes map to pathways directly related to oxidative stress response.    <P>
This BRIC-LED 002 experiment focuses on how mutants in the genes for the proteins Calmodulin-Like 24 (CML24) and the NADPH oxidase RBOHD (an enzyme that generates reactive oxygen species) affect spaceflight responses. These genes are thought to play key roles in pathogen response, but accumulating data now indicates they are also involved in hypoxic and flooding-related responses. As hypoxia is a major predicted effect of spaceflight, research in this project has also continued to analyze how this link between CML24 and RBOHD and response to reduced O2 levels occurs.    <P>
When inactivated by knockout mutations, both RBOHD and CML24 led to significant resistance to hypoxic stress. These mutants maintained growth under flooding conditions in excess of 4 weeks and suppressed the induction of molecular markers of hypoxic stress, such as upregulation of the gene ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE. The current working hypothesis being tested is that CML24 is regulating RBOHD function. This is being approached by assessing the responses of double mutants in both genes to flooding stress and low oxygen environments and to challenge with the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:     <P>
(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.    <P>
(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.    <P>
The BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants. <P></td>

						The flight element of this project is currently awaiting availability of the BRIC-LED hardware and associated flight opportunity. The ground-based components have made progress on bioinformatics analysis and tool development. Initial bioinformatics-based analysis suggested that pathogen response might be disrupted in plants growing in spaceflight. Therefore, efforts have been underway to extend these intial bioinformatics-based analytical pipelines. In collaboration with the GeneLab plant analysis working group, a comprehensive analysis of the plant spaceflight transcriptomes deposited at the GeneLab data repository has been made, focusing on transcriptomics experiments performed using the BRIC hardware to find common BRIC-related spaceflight response signatures. This analysis has reinforced many of the expected molecular fingerprints of spaceflight, such as oxidative stress and cell wall modifications but has also revealed interesting new candidate pathways, such as parts of the plant cold response system.     <P>
This BRIC-LED 002 experiment will compare wild type responses to two sets of mutants in the genes for the proteins Calmodulin-like 24 and AtRBOHD. Therefore, the bioinformatics tools  outlined above have been used to ask how these genes might play roles in biological signaling related to the expected stresses in spaceflight. These analyses suggest that especially for RBOHD, mutants in this gene show altered patterns of transcription related to primary metabolism that would be consistent with a pre-adaptation to flooding and hypoxic stress. As both of these stresses are thought to be likely features of the spaceflight environment, this observation suggests RBOHD mutants are likely to be resistant to these stresses imposed when growing on orbit. Analysis has therefore been made for the flooding and hypoxia growth phenotypes of knockout mutants in both CML24 and RBOHD in ground-based assays to provide some context for possible phenotypes seen in spaceflight. These studies show that both RBOHD and CML24 are involved in the response to hypoxia and flooding challenge. This resistance is visible at levels from maintained growth to reduced induction of transcriptional markers for hypoxic stress.     <P>
RBOHD is thought to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that signal to a suite of stress responses, suggesting that the altered flooding and hypoxic response in mutants in this gene might be linked to alteration in a wide range of other stress-related phenotypes. Phenotyping and bioinformatics-based analysis of the knockout mutant in RBOHD for responses related to wounding (a stress closely aligned to induction of pathogen response in the plant) suggest alterations in mechanical wound response systems and those related Jasmonic Acid-mediated signaling may accompany growth in space. Unexpectedly, despite this close link between ROS and wound response systems, loss of RBOHD function does not appear to impair the plant-wide damage response signaling.    <P>
During 2020-2021, this work has been presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, the American Society for Plant Biology, and at the ISS Science Symposium. Outreach efforts have also been ongoing within the context of the pandemic-related limitations on travel and contact with virtual presentations to journalism students at Penn State and to an international audiences at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Portugal and at the Symposium of the Space Generation Advisory Council in Taiwan. This project was also part of a virtual outreach program to under-represented groups in (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including the PEOPLE (Precollege Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence) program and in outreach to the general public through participation in programs such as the Friends of Allen Centennial and Madison Master Gardeners. In person outreach activities were possible with school students at the Deke Slayton Memorial Space and Bike Museum in Sparta, WI. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:     <P>
(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequent on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.    <P>
(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.    <P>
The BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants. <P></td>

						In the previous granting period, protocols and procedures had been optimized for growing the Arabidopsis plants that are the focus of this investigation in the BRIC-LED hardware. Therefore, Science Verification Testing and Experiment Verification Testing (EVT) were performed September 2019 and January 2020 as the next steps in preparation for flight. These tests are designed to optimize protocols and procedures and also to spot and solve potential, unexpected issues that emerge as the experiment is performed exactly as it would be on the International Space Station. The Science Verification Testing was successful with all outcomes (germination, plant growth, and RNA isolation) being in the excellent/good range from the predefined mission success criteria. The Experiment Verification Testing was then performed in January 2020 using the protocols refined during the Science Verification test. This testing provided critical feedback revealing the potential for a cryptic failure point for the internal lighting system that could be eliminated with a small change in circuitry design. A new EVT is planned later in 2020 to test these enhanced units.    <P>
Ground-based analysis of pathogen response:   The focus of BRIC-LED 002 is to understand how plant defense is affected by spaceflight. Any alterations in defense signaling would likely be related to one or more aspects of the flight environment such as microgravity, development of hypoxia, and/or increased radiation. BRIC-LED 002 is also comparing responses in wild type to two sets of mutants in the genes for the proteins Calmodulin-like 24 and AtRBOHD. Both of these genes are linked to plant defense signaling through cellular Ca2+ and reactive oxygen-related signaling systems. We have therefore been using a battery of bioinformatic, physiological, and gene expression assays in ground-based analyses to ask how these genes might play roles in stress signaling related to the expected stresses in spaceflight and how these might then affect pathogen defense.    <P>
We have been analyzing potential relationships to hypoxia and flooding-related stresses as these might be encountered in the microgravity environment of spaceflight. These ground-based studies have also been comparing wild-type plants to the knockout mutants in CML24 and RBOHD that will be flown on BRIC-LED 002. From these studies, we have found that both genes are involved in the response to long-term flooding challenge.     <P>
As both CML24 and RBOHD are related to Ca2+-dependent signaling, we have also been working on defining how the cellular Ca2+ response network might be integrated into their defense and flooding signaling systems. The dynamics of these cellular Ca2+ changes are regulated by the Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated ATPases. We have found that two of these ATPase Ca2+ pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, are required for Ca2+ signaling and subsequent pathogen signaling. These pumps are found on the internal vacuolar membrane of the cell and unexpectedly, we were able to rescue the Ca2+ signaling and the defense abilities of the knockout mutant in both by redirecting a pump from the plasma membrane to the vacuole, suggesting an unexpected flexibility in the pathogen Ca2+ signaling system and indicating that the vacuole may be a major site of pathogen signaling processing.     <P>
We have also continued to develop bioinformatics-based tools to be able to compare ground-based and flight samples in the BRIC hardware to infer response systems linked to reactive oxygen species-ROS (RBOHD) and Ca2+ (CML24) that are expected in the BRIC-LED flight samples. The bioinformatics engine developed to allow these kinds of analyses, the TOAST database, was published in early 2020 in Frontiers in Plant Science (See Bibliography section).    <P>
  Presentations, Outreach and Education:   During 2019-2020, we have presented this research at the annual meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research and the ISS R&D conference. We have also used our space research as a base for our outreach efforts, where we have used it in projects for under-represented groups in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), such as the PEOPLE program, in presentations for high school students and undergraduates (e.g., University of Wisconsin-Madison’s BioHouse), to K-12 teachers via courses for the BioPharmaceutical Technology Center’s Summer training program and to a program for California high school teachers, and internationally, e.g., to school students in Mumbai and Calcutta, India.     <P>
We continue to work closely with Madison West High School’s Rocketry Society. These students have designed, built, and flown Arabidopsis experiments on their rocket flights and have analyzed hypergravity profiles taken from their rocket launches, then using QPCR to define how these stresses alter defense signaling. This is a continuing program where we are developing a pipeline of talented and engaged students who are going on to College in STEM areas.     <P>
We continue to maintain a “Collaboratory” where biology and engineering undergraduates and high school students come together to develop high throughput phenotyping equipment and other hardware relevant to our spaceflight-related work. Over 2019-2020 we have mentored approximately 10 students as part of this program, working on various plant molecular and engineering projects related to space biology and BRIC-LED-related research, with a team developing mechanical stimulation systems for plants (based on vibrations or wind/rain simulators) to define mechano-response to these effects.  We also work closely with the Insight Wisconsin program for undergraduate inventors. Our current team here is designing a clinostat for high throughput screening for spaceflight-related phenotypes. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. Use of the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings allows direct testing of this idea. Specifically, the project will:     <P>
(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. Plants will be grown in the hardware and then challenged with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. Comparison of subsequrnt on-orbit responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24 will then be made.    <P>
(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.    <P>
The BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow direct testing of the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research is addressing how pathogen sensing and response operates in plants, targeting the Ca2+-dependent and reactive oxygen signaling machinery. The results from this work are not only providing insight into how pathogen signals impact plant growth and defense responses in space but also are contributing to our understanding of similar responses on Earth. Pathogen attack is a major limit on crop productivity with estimates of global losses in the range of 20% across multiple major crops such as wheat, maize, rice, soybean, and potato. The pathogen sensing and response systems triggered by the molecular signals of bacterial attack in space are also those employed by plants challenged by pathogens on Earth. Thus, this work aimed at analysis of how reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling is involved in the defense response systems induced during spaceflight should also help our understanding for these same systems in this general plant defense response system on Earth. These results will provide information to highlight novel molecular targets for potential manipulation to tailor plant responses to the wide spectrum of pathogens that attack plants. <P></td>

						Genetic materials: This experiment will use wild type and two mutants each in the genes CALMODULIN-LIKE 24 (CML24, a protein linked to Ca2+ signaling) and Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog D (RBOHD, an enzyme that makes the stress signal reactive oxygen species). Two independent knockout mutants in both of these genes have been isolated and confirmed by PCR genotyping and QPCR analysis. Seed from all 5 lines growing side-by-side (to allow for robust comparisons) have also been bulked to ensure sufficient materials exist to support flight, multiple scrubs and ground-based testing. All the genotypes have also been tested to confirm they show far-red inhibition of germination, a critical element in the experiment design (see below).    <P>
Far-Red Light-Induced Dormancy -- For BRIC-LED-002, Arabidopsis seeds will be planted at Kennedy Space Center and germinated on orbit in the BRIC-LED hardware aboard the ISS. Therefore, it is important to delay germination of the seeds until after the experiment arrives at the ISS. Arabidopsis seed germination is inhibited by far-red light (~730 nm) and triggered by red (~680 nm). Therefore, to delay germination until the plants are in the lit growth chamber on orbit, far-red irradiation inhibition of germination will be employed. During July and August of 2019, procedures for using this approach with the BRIC-LED hardware were tested as they required some customization. This test was also used to assess how well the plants would grow in the BRIC-LED system to set conditions to be used in the Science and Experiment Verification Tests.    <P>
After planting 16 seeds/ Petri dish under sterile conditions, the seed containing plates were far-red irradiated and stored in the dark at 4°C for 1 day. The plates were then integrated into the BRIC-LED Petri dish fixation units under far red lighting to maintain dormancy. The PDFUs were then integrated into two BRICs and stored for 7 days to mimic the timing of preflight, flight, and berthing. The LEDs in the BRIC were then activated to induce germination and seedling growth. Illumination conditions were matched to those used in the BRIC-LED-001 hardware demonstration (85% red LED, 15% blue at 60 µMoles intensity with a 4h/2h light dark cycle to mitigate potential heating issues). After 8 days, the BRICs were de-integrated.    <P>
This test run demonstrated that the delay in germination and subsequent growth conditions were suitable for the flight experiment. Seedlings showed no evidence of stress (such as anthocyanin pigment accumulation), suggesting the lighting and other conditions were also compatible with the proposed experimentation. The seedling size was smaller than the maximum the hardware could accommodate and so the growth period will be extended from 8 to 10 days for the Science Verification Test (SVT) to generate more materials for subsequent analysis. The SVT is planned for the end of September 2019.    <P>
Ground-based analysis of pathogen response: Alterations in defense signaling in spaceflight would likely be related to one or more aspects of the flight environment such as microgravity, altered mechanical interactions, development of hypoxia, and/or increased radiation. Experiments have therefore been addressing the potential role of these factor in defense signaling, starting with the mechanical environment. Using a battery of physiological assays and QPCR, we have uncovered that mechanical signals alter the defense response network and vice-versa. We have also found that CML24 plays an integral role in this cross-talk. Thus, CML24 acts as a positive regulator of touch-inducible gene expression, with mutants in this gene showing reduced vegetative growth that is unresponsive to touch stimulation (wild type shows touch-induced reduction of growth under the same conditions). CML24 is also required to support elicitor-induced defense gene expression, suggesting it lies at the signaling crossroads that links both response systems. Mutants in the closely related gene CML12 also block touch-induced gene expression and compromise defense, whereas mutants in other closely related proteins such as CML16 compromise touch but not defense responses. These analyses are beginning to build a map of where CML24 sits with respect to the mechanical and defense pathways and provide a mechanism for a link between the two. Current work is testing how mutants in CML24 and RBOHD interact with defense networks and how they grow on 3-d clinostats to help define their relationships to a further set of spaceflight environmental stressors.    <P>
Spectrum Supplement: BRIC-LED-002 was also awarded a supplement for 2019-2020 to help with hardware testing for the new Spectrum fluorescence imager for the ISS. The goal of this work is to characterize biological responses in the Spectrum to help provide some guidance to future users about capabilities and potential issues with the new fluorescence imaging hardware. For this project Arabidopsis has been successfully grown in the Spectrum and this testing pinpointed a sample dish fogging issue that would have severely impacted on the imaging quality of biological samples. The Spectrum engineering team has subsequently solved this problem. A combined experiment using Arabidopsis (samples from the Ferl/Paul and Gilroy labs) and yeast (samples from the Hammond lab) has also tested growth analyses and imaging of a range of green fluorescent protein-based reporters in the samples. The imaging data from these tests is under analysis to define imaging resolutions and sensitivity. Testing of growth and responses in the Spectrum is planned to continue to support an on-orbit test of the hardware later in 2019.    <P>
Presentationa, Outreach, and Education: During 2018-2019, presentations on this area of pathogen research have been made at the 2019 MidWest Plant Cell Dynamics Meeting, the annual meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research, and at venues such as the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. This space research also forms a base for outreach efforts at events ranging from University of Wisconsin sponsored outreach days (e.g., University of Wisconsin’s Science Expeditions) to presentations for middle school and K-12 teachers (Biotechnology Institute summer training program).     <P>
The project also involves a close collaboration with the Madison West High School’s Rocketry Society. These students have designed, built, and flown Arabidopsis experiments on their rocket flights. The students are currently working in the lab following pathogen and touch-related gene expression under hyper-gravity to compare to effects of their rocket launches to help understand how the stresses of launch might affect plant growth and defense signaling. This is a continuing program developing a pipeline of talented and engaged students who are going on to College in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) areas.     <P>
In the lab, biology and engineering undergraduates and high school students also come together to develop hardware such as high throughput phenotyping equipment and other hardware relevant to spaceflight-related work. Over 2018-2019 this has involved approximately 15 undergraduate students working on various plant molecular and engineering projects related to space biology and BRIC-LED, with a team developing custom hypoxia chambers that mimic the BRIC-LED environment.    <P>
This last year has also been notable with in providing support with interviews and lab visits to about 20 groups of middle/high school students who are part of the First Lego League Championship. This year this league focused on challenges related to sustaining astronauts during long-term manned spaceflight. Many of the groups chose to design solutions for plant growth in space, hence their interest in flight projects such as BRIC-LED. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Analysis of the plant biology transcriptomics and proteomics data in the GeneLab data system reveals that a common feature of spaceflight is alteration in plant defense-related transcripts and proteins in space. Anecdotally, plants have also been seen to suffer from pathogen attack during spaceflight missions. Taken together, these observations suggest a hypothesis that plant defense responses may be compromised by spaceflight. Such a disruption of defense would have important implications for the management of plants grown as part of an astronaut life support system. This is especially relevant given the large microbial community on board the International Space Station (ISS) and the possibility that spaceflight triggers enhanced microbial pathogenicity. However, the critical unanswered question is whether the altered defense gene expression seen in spaceflight truly plays out as altered susceptibility to pathogens. We therefore propose to use the Biological Research in Canisters-Light Emitting Diodes (BRIC-LED) hardware growing Arabidopsis seedlings to directly test this idea. Specifically, we propose to:     <P>
(1) Capitalize on the unique capabilities of the BRIC-LED hardware to analyze the transcriptome and cell wall structure responses of Arabidopsis seedlings grown in spaceflight. We propose to grow these plants and then challenge them with the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. We will compare these responses in wild-type and mutants in the defense regulators AtRBOHD and CML24.    <P>
(2) Use comparisons to ground-based control experiments and clinostat and hypoxia treatment to ask whether such changes are likely linked to the microgravity or hypoxic elements of spaceflight and whether these changes may affect the ability of the plant to defend itself against pathogen challenge.    <P>
The BRIC-LED/Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware is well-suited to this experimental approach. Thus, the two-stage PDFU hardware will allow both stimulation (injection of flg22 elicitor onto the seedlings) and subsequent fixation of samples (with RNAlater). As the experiment would use flg22 peptide to elicit defense response, potential problems with flying live pathogen will be circumvented. The experimental design will capitalize on the minimal crew time needed for a BRIC-based experiment and the unique capabilities of the BRIC hardware to treat plants in situ on orbit. The results from this experiment will allow us to directly ask the critical question of whether the ability of plants to mount a defense response is compromised during spaceflight. <P></td>
