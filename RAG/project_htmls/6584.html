                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal seeks a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in plant responses and adaptations to low pressure environments, with the ultimate goal of producing plants that are specifically designed to thrive in low pressures. The essential drivers of this project are 1) the inescapable engineering limitations to producing orbital, lunar or Martian plant growth facilities that contain earth-normal atmospheric pressures, and 2) the knowledge that plants in certain circumstances can live under reduced pressures. In the initial phases of the project, we propose to use the tools of functional genomics in the model plant system of arabidopsis to examine molecular genetic responses that occur during initial and chronic exposure to atmospheres ranging from near earth normal to near Martian pressures and containing various gas mixtures. Based on the results from these analyses, we will identify genes and metabolic pathways that are activated and repressed in response to low-pressure atmospheres, and predict alterations that might enhance the adaptation process. Finally, we will select and directly engineer genetic changes that will test these predictions and potentially lead to plants with enhanced abilities to live in low-pressure environments.     <P>
    <P>
The long-term goal of this project is an understanding of the molecular changes in gene activity that accompany the response and adaptation of plants to low atmospheric pressures. Such an understanding will lead to hardware engineering and/or plant genetic engineering modifications that will mitigate the negative impacts of low-pressure atmospheres on plant growth and development, enhance adaptation and strengthen the role of plants as integral and efficient components of extraterrestrial human life support systems. There are four specific aims:    <P>
1. determine the spectrum of genes activated and repressed by low pressure   2. develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in response and adaptation   3. determine the effects of defined gas mixtures in mitigating the impacts of low pressure atmospheres  4. develop and test biological engineering strategies to enhance growth in low atmospheric pressures    <P>

						Conclusions.    <P>
Arabidopsis plants respond to hypobaria with extensive changes in gene expression patterns.  So even though plants have been known to survive exposure to hypobaria, clearly survival in hypobaric conditions requires a dynamic adaptive response. Some of the altered gene expression patterns are similar to those involved in the hypoxic stress response, as would be expected from the low oxygen partial pressures present in hypobaria; yet some changes in gene expression patterns are unique to hypobaric conditions. These unique differential gene expression patterns demonstrate that hypobaria is not equivalent to hypoxia as an abiotic stress and suggest that, for plants, the response to hypobaria is more complex than the acclimation to the reduced partial pressures of oxygen inherent to low atmospheric pressures. By extension, environmental compensation for hypobaric stress in plants is not as simple as increasing the oxygen content as was done for humans in the low pressure environments of the early space age.      <P>
Hypobaria does not equal hypoxia.    <P>
Although hypobaria engages pathways distinct from those seen in response to hypoxia, there is significant overlap, indicating that the hypobaria response includes, but is not limited to, a typical response to hypoxia. A relatively small number of genes are induced by both hypobaria and hypoxia , primarily genes involved in fermentative pathways and oxygen transport (Klok et al., 2002). A much larger set of genes is repressed in response both conditions and includes representatives from a wide range of metabolic pathways (see Supporting Information). This wide-spread repression is a well characterized phenomenon of hypoxic stress e.g. (Sachs et al., 1996; Vartapetian and Jackson, 1997; Klok et al., 2002). A much smaller cluster includes genes that were repressed in hypoxic conditions, but were virtually unchanged in hypobaric conditions. The genes representing this group encode several putative proteins that may represent metabolic processes related to oxygen sensing that are mediated through a heme- or iron-based sensor (Quinn et al., 2002). Iron based sensors have been implicated for direct oxygen or indirect redox sensing in various hypoxia-responsive pathways in eukaryotes (Bunn et al., 1998; Zhu and Bunn, 2001; Mecklenburgh et al., 2002), relying in part on subtilisin-catalyzed proteolytic inactivation of p450 that functions in the reduction of Fe(III) in the signal transduction cascade (Aravind and Koonin, 2001). Another small cluster is represented by genes that were induced in hypoxic conditions, and repressed in hypobaric conditions. This group includes additional heme-related proteins, kinases and phosphatases typical of a hypoxic response. The disparity in gene expression patterns displayed in each of these clusters suggests that that hypobaria and hypoxia may differentially activate certain alternative oxygen sensing and transport pathways.     <P>
Desiccation associated pathways are induced by hypobaria.    <P>
Cluster A2 defines a large group of genes showing increased expression in hypobaria while being unaffected or repressed in hypoxia, a group largely composed of genes associated with desiccation and ABA signaling related processes (e.g. Ozturk et al., 2002). Examples from cluster A2 include ABI2 (Chak et al., 2000),  the APL3 subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Weber et al., 1995; Rook et al., 2001),  LEAs, (e.g. Siddiqui et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2002) dehydrins and rab-like proteins, (e.g. Mantyla et al., 1995; Nylander et al., 2001; Kizis and Pages, 2002) rd29B and cor15B (e.g. Wilhelm and Thomashow, 1993; Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1993), and aldehyde dehydrogenase (Kirch et al., 2001). Thus, it appears that the adaptation response of Arabidopsis to 10 kPa is, at a minimum, a specific adaptation to perceived desiccation which is overlaid upon an adaptation to hypoxia. However, the fact that the plants were grown in a humid environment (>95% rh within the plates), showed no loss of fresh weight or turgor, and yet still responded to 10 kPa as if they were dehydrated, indicates that the desiccation response is likely due to the perception of increased water flux caused by the low pressure environment (Corey et al., 2002) rather than absolute loss of water in the plants.     <P>
Arabidopsis plants at 10 kPa presented no wilting, browning or other hallmarks of desiccation. This observation begs the question as to whether successful adaptation to a 10 kPa environment actually requires the activation of desiccation related pathways. It is possible that as long as there is sufficient environmental water available in the growth medium, an induction of desiccation-related metabolism may not be necessary for survival. With regard to bioregenerative life support for space, if the desiccation response is not necessary for adaptation to low pressure, then the induction of these pathways could represent a drain on metabolism with a resultant cost to production. Under this scenario, metabolic engineering designed to divert the inappropriate desiccation response could reduce the drain of these pathways on metabolism. If, however, the desiccation response is required, then enhancing desiccation tolerance may increase production at low pressure. Given the specificity and detail of the 10 kPa response indicated by the present analyses, studies at intermediate and extended low pressures and mutations in the desiccation and ABA response pathways should clarify the role of desiccation responses to low atmospheric pressures. The present data do suggest that the desiccation stress response is tied as much to the flux of water through stomata as to the physical dehydration of tissue.     <P>
Concluding remarks.     The experiments and conclusions discussed here expose the need for continued evaluation of the effects of low pressure on biological systems. In some ways, the gene expression data suggest that we actually have only a small fraction of the data necessary to make informed choices on the gas composition and pressures within vessels that support plant growth. By extension, these data also beg the questions of what sort of undetected responses and adaptations to low pressures occur in other organisms, including humans, and whether low pressure environments have contributed to any of the existing spaceflight data on biology and biological responses in spaceflight environments. So the short term questions involve deepening our understanding of responses and adaptation to low pressures for all organisms and biological systems that may be a part of spaceflight and extraterrestrial habitats. Indeed, unpublished molecular data indicate that even the relatively small pressure drops to 75 kPa that occur in the space shuttle effect the expression of hundreds of genes in Arabidopsis. That being the case, even seemingly small choices about operations and procedures conducted within habitat environments can have measurable and dramatic impacts on the biology of those habitats. Therefore very near term decisions involving, for example, the choices of atmospheric composition and pressure in the Crew Exploration Vehicle will have long term implications for biology. In the longer term, the use of low pressure environments may enable life support systems that otherwise would be impossible to construct or maintain under higher atmospheric pressures, keeping viable the concepts of inflatable greenhouses. For example, transparent greenhouses could be erected on Mars using currently available materials, but only if the internal pressure of the greenhouse could be maintained below 7.5 kPa (Boston, 1981). The rather dramatic changes in gene expression that occur at 10 kPa suggest that response and adaptation to lower pressures will be even more extensive, but the study of such pressures are well within the capacity of current experiment chamber design and molecular expression technology.    <P>

						Description and summary of research:    <P>
This proposal seeks a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in plant responses and adaptations to low pressure environments, with the ultimate goal of producing plants that are specifically designed to thrive in low pressures. The essential drivers of this project are 1) the inescapable engineering limitations to producing orbital, lunar or Martian plant growth facilities that contain earth-normal atmospheric pressures, and 2) the knowledge that plants in certain circumstances can live under reduced pressures. In the initial phases of the project, we propose to use the tools of functional genomics in the model plant system of arabidopsis to examine molecular genetic responses that occur during initial and chronic exposure to atmospheres ranging from near earth normal to near Martian pressures and containing various gas mixtures. Based on the results from these analyses, we will identify genes and metabolic pathways that are activated and repressed in response to low-pressure atmospheres, and predict alterations that might enhance the adaptation process. Finally, we will select and directly engineer genetic changes that will test these predictions and potentially lead to plants with enhanced abilities to live in low-pressure environments.

Preliminary experiments set the stage for the design of the current proposal. Experiments utilizing plants of various ages exposed to low pressure and low oxygen environments have begun to fulfill specific aim 1 and address aims 2 and 3. An experiment utilizing 9 day old plants grown vertically on nutrient agar media was designed to evaluate the effects of hypobaric (10 kPa) and hypoxic (2% oxygen) environments on global gene expression patterns.  These experiments demonstrate that Arabidopsis plants respond to hypobaria with extensive changes in gene expression patterns, indicating that hypobaria elicits a dynamic adaptive response. Some of the altered gene expression patterns are similar to those involved in the hypoxic stress response, as would be expected from the low oxygen partial pressures present in hypobaria; yet some changes in gene expression patterns are unique to hypobaric conditions. These unique differential gene expression patterns demonstrate that hypobaria is not equivalent to hypoxia as an abiotic stress and suggest that, for plants, the response to hypobaria is more complex than the acclimation to the reduced partial pressures of oxygen inherent to low atmospheric pressures. By extension, environmental compensation for hypobaric stress in plants is not as simple as increasing the oxygen content as was done for humans in the low pressure environments of the early space age.  These data were published in the journal Plant Physiology (cover article) in January 2004 (Paul et al., 2004).   In 2005 the analyses of the mature arabidopsis plants to evaluate the effects of exposing plants to hypobaric environments of increasing severity have been completed.  Plants were exposed to atmospheres of 101 kPa (control – normal atmosphere at sea level), 75 kPa, 50 kPa, 25 kPa and 10 kPa for 24 hours then harvested for RNA extraction and analyses. RNA was prepared for all of these samples and they have been evaluated for global changes in gene expression patterns with Affymetrix microarray gene chip technologies (see Paul et al. 2004 for details). The data indicate that even very small changes in atmospheric pressures have a broad impact of the mobilization of the arabidopsis genome.    <P>
The experiments initiated in the late spring of 2004 are still under analysis and builds on these findings. They are described briefly below, along with their respective status of analysis.    <P>
Variable atmospheres and developmental stages – plate grown arabidopsis plants.  These experiments were conducted at the University of Guelph in collaboration with Dr. Mike Dixon. This set of experiments was extensive, and designed to be comprehensive enough to address the first three aims, and thereby lead to the development of strategies for aim 4. The experiments were conducted throughout the month of May in Guelph and are comprised of five parts.      <P>
Particulars of the experiments conducted at the University of Guelph were detailed in the 2004 Task Book. In 2005 the microarray analyses for many of these samples have been completed. The experiment conducted with 10 day old plants investigating the effects of variations in atmospheric pressure (nine different atmospheric pressures for a period of 24 hours: 101 kPa, 75 kPa, 50 kPa, 25 kPa, 10 kPa, 5 kPa, Ox1, Ox2, Ox3) are essentially complete and are being developed for publication. The analyses required 62 microarrays: arabidopsis root and shoot samples from the 9 pressures above, multiplied by three as they were conducted in biological triplicate (three separate chambers for each pressure treatment) plus eight samples representing tissue culture callus cells at various representative pressures. The analyses of the microarray data have been completed and are in the initial stages of being organized for publication.    <P>
Abcissic Acid (ABA) mutants and adaptability to hypobaric conditions.  Genes associated with ABA metabolism were among the most prominent examples of differential gene expression in response to hypobaria. Arabidopsis lines that contain mutations in a variety of ABA related pathways are being examined for their ability to cope with hypobaric environments, and dissected for altered patterns of gene expression in response to hypobaria.     <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal seeks a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in plant responses and adaptations to low pressure environments, with the ultimate goal of producing plants that are specifically designed to thrive in low pressures. The essential drivers of this project are 1) the inescapable engineering limitations to producing orbital, lunar or Martian plant growth facilities that contain earth-normal atmospheric pressures, and 2) the knowledge that plants in certain circumstances can live under reduced pressures. In the initial phases of the project, we propose to use the tools of functional genomics in the model plant system of arabidopsis to examine molecular genetic responses that occur during initial and chronic exposure to atmospheres ranging from near earth normal to near Martian pressures and containing various gas mixtures. Based on the results from these analyses, we will identify genes and metabolic pathways that are activated and repressed in response to low-pressure atmospheres, and predict alterations that might enhance the adaptation process. Finally, we will select and directly engineer genetic changes that will test these predictions and potentially lead to plants with enhanced abilities to live in low-pressure environments.     The long-term goal of this project is an understanding of the molecular changes in gene activity that accompany the response and adaptation of plants to low atmospheric pressures. Such an understanding will lead to hardware engineering and/or plant genetic engineering modifications that will mitigate the negative impacts of low-pressure atmospheres on plant growth and development, enhance adaptation and strengthen the role of plants as integral and efficient components of extraterrestrial human life support systems. There are four specific aims:    <P>
1. determine the spectrum of genes activated and repressed by low pressure   2. develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in response and adaptation   3. determine the effects of defined gas mixtures in mitigating the impacts of low pressure atmospheres  4. develop and test biological engineering strategies to enhance growth in low atmospheric pressures      The long-term goal of this project is an understanding of the molecular changes in gene activity that accompany the response and adaptation of plants to low atmospheric pressures.

						Preliminary experiments set the stage for the design of the current proposal. Experiments utilizing plants of various ages exposed to low pressure and low oxygen environments have begun to fulfill specific aim 1 and address aims 2 and 3. An experiment utilizing 9 day old plants grown vertically on nutrient agar media was designed to evaluate the effects of hypobaric (10 kPa) and hypoxic (2% oxygen) environments on global gene expression patterns.  These experiments demonstrate that Arabidopsis plants respond to hypobaria with extensive changes in gene expression patterns, indicating that hypobaria elicits a dynamic adaptive response. Some of the altered gene expression patterns are similar to those involved in the hypoxic stress response, as would be expected from the low oxygen partial pressures present in hypobaria; yet some changes in gene expression patterns are unique to hypobaric conditions. These unique differential gene expression patterns demonstrate that hypobaria is not equivalent to hypoxia as an abiotic stress and suggest that, for plants, the response to hypobaria is more complex than the acclimation to the reduced partial pressures of oxygen inherent to low atmospheric pressures. By extension, environmental compensation for hypobaric stress in plants is not as simple as increasing the oxygen content as was done for humans in the low pressure environments of the early space age.  These data were published in the journal Plant Physiology (cover article) in January 2004 (Paul et al., 2004).    <P>
The design of the next series of experiments builds on these findings. They are described briefly below, along with their respective status of analysis.    <P>
1.  Variations in hypobaric stress – mature arabidopsis plants.  These experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of exposing plants to hypobaric environments of increasing severity.  Plants were exposed to atmospheres of 101 kPa (control – normal atmosphere at sea level), 75 kPa, 50 kPa, 25 kPa and 10 kPa for 24 hours then harvested for RNA extraction and analyses. RNA has been prepared for all of these samples and they have been evaluated for global changes in gene expression patterns with Affymetrix microarray gene chip technologies (see Paul et al. 2004 for details). The data from the microarrays have been analyzed and these data are in the process of being developed for publication.  2.  Variable atmospheres and developmental stages – plate grown arabidopsis plants.  These experiments were conducted at the University of Guelph in collaboration with Dr. Mike Dixon. This set of experiments was extensive, and designed to be comprehensive enough to address the first three aims, and thereby lead to the development of strategies for aim 4. The experiments were conducted throughout the month of May in Guelph and are comprised of five parts.      <P>
2 - Experiment 1 – week of May 3rd:  variation in pressure, 24 hr exposure, 11 day plate plants. Total plates needed for Exp 1 = 225. Plants for this experiment will be planted on 4/15 then placed at 4° C. Growth will be initiated when the plates are removed from the cold on designated days by Mike’s group:  Exp 1: 101, 75, 10 set of plates placed in 23° C growth chamber on 4/23; Exp 1: 25, 50, 5  set of plates placed in 23° C growth chamber 4/24 and Exp 1: Ox1, Ox2*, 0.7 set of plates placed in 23° C growth chamber 4/25.  Exp 1, Day 1 (Tue 5/4) - 11 day old plate-grown plants will be exposed to 101, 75, 10 in triplicate, plus TC callus tissue in 101 and 50 treatments. Each treatment set is loaded with a 60 minute stagger to help facilitate the harvest step at the end of the 24 hour period. Three internal replicates composed of 3 plates separated into roots and shoots (R, S) will be collected from each chamber.   Exp 1, Day 2 (Wed 5/5) - 11 day old plate-grown plants will be exposed to 25, 50, 5 in triplicate, plus TC callus tissue in 10 and 5 treatments.    Exp 1, Day 3 (Thur 5/6) - 11 day old plate-grown plants will be exposed to Ox1, Ox2, 0.7 in triplicate  Status: Most of the samples from this experiment are being stored for future use (in RNAlater at -20°C). From this set, only the isuue culture samples have been fully processed. The tissue culture RNAs were submitted for microarray analyses with the samples from Experiment 2.2 (below).    <P>
2 - Experiment 2 – week of May 10th:   variation in atmospheric pressure, 24 hr exposure, 10 day and 5 day old plants for arrays. Total plates needed for Exp 2 = 720.  10 day old plate-grown plants will be represented with sufficient abundance for array analyses (internal replicates composed of three plates) while in the younger plant (5 day old) replicates are composed of one plate each (providing 3 internal replicates). All plates/ages will be exposed to 9 different atmospheric pressures for a period of 24 hours: 101 kPa, 75 kPa, 50 kPa, 25 kPa, 10 kPa, 5 kPa, Ox1, Ox2, Ox3.  Nine chambers are used per day in treatment sets of three replicates. Each treatment set is loaded with a 60 minute stagger to help facilitate the harvest step at the end of the 24 hour period. Three biological replicates composed of 3 plates each (9 total) separated into roots and shoots (R, S) will be collected from each chamber for the 10 day old plants. The younger plants will be represented by four plates (1 plate for each biological replicate) but the plates will be more thickly planted, and in several tiers (dependent on age).  10 day plants are separated into roots and shoots and harvested to RNAlater in 2.0 mL screw-top microfuge tubes. 5 day plants are harvested whole.   Exp 2, Day 1 (Mon 5/10) – 10day and 5day exposed to 101, 75, 10 in triplicate   Exp 2, Day 2 (Tue 5/11) – 10day and 5day exposed to 25, 50, 5 in triplicate   Exp 2, Day 3 (Wed 5/12) – 10day and 5day exposed to Ox1, Ox2, Ox3 in triplicate   Ox1 = 50kPa with O2 added to equal normoxic conditions  Ox2 = 25kPa with O2 added to equal normoxic conditions   Ox3 = 101kPa but with a reduced oxygen atmosphere to equal pp at 25kPa (5% Oxygen)  Status: The RNA has been isolated from the samples described in this experiment and have been submitted for microarray analyses. The analysis of the array data is on-going.    <P>
2 - Experiment 3 – week-end of May 13th:  Development under pressure.  Total plates needed for Exp 3 = 200. A series of ages (0, 3, 5, 8, 10 day old) will be started in the chambers together and allowed to grow in the designated atmosphere (101, 50, 10) for 72 hours.   All harvested whole to RNAlater beginning Monday 5/17  Status: The samples from this experiment are being stored for future use (in RNAlater at -20°C).    <P>
2 - Experiment 4 – wk of May 17th:  Exposure time course. Total plates needed for Exp 4 = 180. 10 day old plate-grown plants will be exposed to 10 kPa and samples will be taken over a 72 hour time course: 72 hrs, 48 hrs, 12 hrs, 6 hrs, 3 hrs, 1 hr, plus 101 controls harvested with each time point.  Six different chambers will be used on each of two separate sets of launches (Set 1 and Set 2). Three replicates composed of 3 plates each (total of 9) separated into roots and shoots (R, S) will be collected for each time point, plus corresponding controls at each time.   Plants are and harvested to RNAlater.  Status: The samples from this experiment are being stored for future use (in RNAlater at -20°C).    <P>
2 - Experiment 5 – 0.7 kPa (Mars pressure) time course. 10 day old plate-grown plants will be exposed to 0.7 kPa, observed and samples will be taken over a 12 hour time course: 12 hrs, 6 hrs, 3 hrs, 1 hr, plus 101 controls harvested with each time point.  Two sets of chambers (6) chambers will be used. At least three replicates composed of 1 plate each (could run 4 total if you had them) separated into roots and shoots (R, S) will be collected for each time point, plus corresponding controls at each time (below).   Plates should be set up with double thick agar. This can be done with an existing plate (of the appropriate age) by carefully lifting the entire agar/seedling mass off of one plate and laying it on blanket-wise to another (blank) plate of agar.    Lay on smoothly with a rolling motion to avoid trapping bubbles.  Status: The samples from this experiment are being stored for future use (in RNAlater at -20°C).    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal seeks a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved in plant responses and adaptations to low pressure environments, with the ultimate goal of producing plants that are specifically designed to thrive in low pressures. The essential drivers of this project are 1) the inescapable engineering limitations to producing orbital, lunar or Martian plant growth facilities that contain earth-normal atmospheric pressures, and 2) the knowledge that plants in certain circumstances can live under reduced pressures. In the initial phases of the project, we propose to use the tools of functional genomics in the model plant system of arabidopsis to examine molecular genetic responses that occur during initial and chronic exposure to atmospheres ranging from near earth normal to near Martian pressures and containing various gas mixtures. Based on the results from these analyses, we will identify genes and metabolic pathways that are activated and repressed in response to low-pressure atmospheres, and predict alterations that might enhance the adaptation process. Finally, we will select and directly engineer genetic changes that will test these predictions and potentially lead to plants with enhanced abilities to live in low-pressure environments.     The long-term goal of this project is an understanding of the molecular changes in gene activity that accompany the response and adaptation of plants to low atmospheric pressures. Such an understanding will lead to hardware engineering and/or plant genetic engineering modifications that will mitigate the negative impacts of low-pressure atmospheres on plant growth and development, enhance adaptation and strengthen the role of plants as integral and efficient components of extraterrestrial human life support systems. There are four specific aims:    <P>
1. determine the spectrum of genes activated and repressed by low pressure   2. develop an understanding of the metabolic pathways involved in response and adaptation   3. determine the effects of defined gas mixtures in mitigating the impacts of low pressure atmospheres  4. develop and test biological engineering strategies to enhance growth in low atmospheric pressures      The long-term goal of this project is an understanding of the molecular changes in gene activity that accompany the response and adaptation of plants to low atmospheric pressures. Such an understanding will lead to hardware engineering and/or plant genetic engineering modifications that will mitigate the negative impacts of low-pressure atmospheres on plant growth and development, enhance adaptation and strengthen the role of plants as integral and efficient components of extraterrestrial human life support systems.  <P></td>
