                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. As in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments. Additional benefits of the project include training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. <P></td>

						Report for activities since April 2015    <P>
Time line: Space-X3 launched April 18, 2014; the payload returned May 18 and arrived at KSC 5/21/14. Post flight processing was accomplished between 5/22 and 5/25/14. Ground control experiments (performed Aug. 14, 2014) ran into additional delays because of a shortage of hardware (MFCs were badly corroded during flight experiment so that flight hardware could not be used for the ground control). The first ground control experiment resulted in lack of germination (likely the result of RNALater related NH3 contamination), and fixative leaked. Difficulties to obtain approval for a second clinorotated ground control delayed the second ground control experiment until Jan. 7, 2015. A no-cost extension ensured that most (but not all) analyses were completed. Subsequent work was substantially affected by the departure of the post-doctoral research associate who obtained a job offer in Korea that could not be refused or postponed.    <P>
The analyses of cytoskeletal arrangements was performed by confocal microcopy by June 2015; analyses are ongoing and almost complete. This effort is part of Andrea Edge’s PhD research.   Light microscopy started with sample embedding during de-integration; sectioning was performed in a six-month period (4/2015 – 9/2015, together with corresponding samples from ground controls). Analyses are partially complete and ongoing. Substantial results were obtained.  The experiment provided exciting insights in the gravitropic mechanism of roots, their adaptive responses, and gene regulation during flight and ground controls.     <P>
Results:    <P>
Flight experiment:    <P>
A) Imaging.   The most important part of the flight experiment was the confirmation of the effect of high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) on root curvature. The data provide clear evidence that HGMF does induce root curvature as theory and ground experiments predicted. Because curvature occurred in weightlessness conditions, the gravisensing system of roots is not compromised by space flight. The enhancement of the amyloplast size in space-grown roots (see D, below) indicates metabolic adaptation to reduced effective gravity levels. The induction of curvature by HGMF in space-grown roots indicates that amyloplasts are indeed the organelles that elicit differential growth and therefore the originators of gravitropism.     <P>
B) Cytoskeletal arrangements.   The comparison between static, clinorotated, and space grown roots did not show any substantial differences between the cytoskeletal organization of actin or microtubules. A high resolution analysis showed a greater variation in orientation and coherency of both microtubules and F-actin after clinorotation.     <P>
C) Gene expression.   The examined genes were selected to metabolic relevance and connection to differential elongation. The chosen genes were (in order of average transcription levels with accession number in parentheses): Cytochrome c oxidase, amylase, Ubiquitin, Phosphofructokinase, Hexokinase, Alcohol dehydrogenase, Tubulin, Actin 7, P Pin-formed 1, 3, 7, Sucrose synthase, IAA transcription factor 5, Glucokinase, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Triacylglycerol lipase.    <P>
Comparisons of different conditions included flight conditions, clinorotation, and static ground conditions, with and without HGMF. Measurements were performed in the root tip, root proper, root shoot junction, and seed tissue. Gene transcription levels were assessed with validated primers using SYBR-Green based qPCR analysis.     <P>
Comparisons were based on regressions of the transcription levels of all examined genes and served as basis for the identification of up-or downregulated genes. The methodology resulted in a publication (Houston et al., 2015) and provides reliable assessment of gene regulation. Genes that responded to space condition, clinorotation, and HGMF included auxin transporter PIN1-7, enzymes involved in glycolysis (hexokinase, glucokinase), and sucrose synthase. However, not all tissues responded equally.     <P>
D) Light microscopy.   The purpose of these studies was the identification of amyloplast positioning and size in the root cap. The difference between the size of amyloplasts from space-grown roots and those obtained from clinorotated or static roots was derived from systematic measurements of all detectable starch grains. The difference was highly significant and amounted to an approximate size increase of 30% in diameter. The amyloplast studies are important because they indicate that clinorotation (i.e., hyper-stimulation) reduces amyloplast size. Therefore clinorotation is likely to reduce gravisensitivity.     <P>
It is anticipated that a publication reporting on the results of the flight experiment will be submitted by summer 2016. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. As in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments. Additional benefits of the project include training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. <P></td>

						Research activities during the last 16 months included continued research on brassica growth responses, procedural modifications for the planned flight, launch preparations, launch of the flight experiment on Space-X 3, preliminary evaluation of the flight data, and two attempts of a clinorotated ground control.  Continued research on brassica biology and growth response included the genetic analyses of the effect of reduced oxygen on seedling metabolism. The rationale behind this study concerns two aspects: the determination of the maximal number of seeds that can grow in a confined volume and the response to space conditions where the re-supply of gases occurs in the absence of convection or where convection is reduced and dependent on artificial ventilation. In addition, oxygen consumption for most seeds is highest during germination and the absorbing surface is minimal. The combination of these effects may lead to O2 deprivation. The tests were conducted with seeds grown in 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 21% oxygen.     <P>
Nine genes were tested. Oxygen concentrations below 10% reduced growth and below 5% delayed germination. In the absence of oxygen germination did not occur; however, re-introduction to air resulted in germination in less than 6 hours. These seeds reach the same growth rate as air-grown seedlings within 12 hours. Hypoxia inhibited most genes, especially Amylase (AMY), and sucrose synthase (SuSy), fructose 1,6-P aldolase (ALD), but up-regulated Glucose-P isomerase (GPI). These data have been reported at the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) meetings in Moscow, Russia and are the basis for a future publication.    <P>
Procedural testing and modifications for the planned flight included new braces for the magnetic field chamber (MFC) covers, gaskets for the fixative storage container, and changes in the default fixation time. Preparations also included image modification of the imaging board to minimize distortions. These efforts were based on test images of 1 mm grids and resulted in the development of a software (Photoshop) script.    <P>
Launch preparations started 12/2013 but various delays (including 4 unsuccessful launch attempts) delayed the launch until April 18, 2014, 3:25 pm EDT. The experiment was transferred to the International Space Station (ISS) express rack 10 days later and the experiment started May 7 and fixative was dispensed 47 hours and 25 minutes later, and terminated after successful fixation at 48 h and 30 minutes. Transmitted imaged of growing seedlings showed overall successful germination and, most significantly, root curvature away from the high-gradient magnetic field (HGMF). The experiment was transferred back to the Dragon capsule (5/15/2014@13:55), Dragon undocked (5/18/2014@9:45), and landed successfully (5/18/2014@15:12). The experiment arrived at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC)  (5/22/2014@1:05) and de-integrated within 6 hours.    <P>
Removal of the seeds cassettes from the MFC's showed substantial effects of RNALater storage (total time: 12 days and 22 hours). Corrosion of the NdFeB magnets and presence of high concentrations of ammonium sulfate (main ingredient of RNALater) produced FeSO4 and released ammonium gas. This gas pressurized the MFC and forced most of the fixative into the waste bag that eventually burst and released significant quantities of fixative into the generic containment unit. The waste bag in the non-magnetic MFC remained intact and the MFC with formaldehyde fixative did not produce corrosion to the extent seen for RNALater. Despite these unexpected effects, fixation was successful and the tissue could be processed for gene expression analysis and confocal microscopy.     Gene expression was determined in the root tip (~3 mm), remainder of the root, root/shoot junction, and the seed. The selection is based on recent discoveries of a second gravitropic response that involved the root/shoot junction. This phenomenon is the topic of a dissertation by one of the PI's graduate students. Sixteen genes were selected that are related to previous studies and contained reference genes (UBQ1, COX), cytoskeletal and transport related genes (ACT7, TUB1), auxin response genes (IAA5, PIN3, PIN7), genes related to carbohydrate metabolism (ADH1, AMY, G6PDH5, GLK, HXK, PFK, SUSY), stress metabolism (ADH1), and lipid metabolism (TAGL).    <P>
The preliminary evaluation was based on the comparison of flight data ± experimental condition (e.g., magnetic vs. non-magnetic MFC; flight, static ground control etc.). These conditions prompted research into the determination of up- or down-regulated genes in the various tissues and in consultation with a colleague at the Louisiana Accelerator Center, Dr. Louis Houston, an outlier theorem was developed that allows the identification of significant changes in gene expression. This identification utilizes non-redundant data sets and identifies z = 2‹xi› as the outlier boundary. 2‹xi› = N+2z0/(N+1). Since N+z0/(N+1) is continuous on N, 2‹xi› is the upper outlier boundary for all values of N.    <P>
Based on this result, gene activation can be derived as the calculated unique distance of the mean between two data sets. This description identifies significant upregulation of a subset of genes in the presence of HGMF. Upregulated genes include: ADH1, AMY, GLK, HXK, IAA5, SuSy, PIN1, PIN3, and PIN7. Additional evaluation concerns the identification of effects between HGMF in weightlessness and 1-g conditions and clinorotation. Interestingly, clinorotation upregulates amylase (starch degrading enzyme).     <P>
Microscopic analyses focus on two aspects, distribution of amyloplasts and organization of cytoskeletal proteins. Unexpectedly, the space flight material showed that columella amyloplasts are ~15% larger than ground controls. This observation indicates that weightlessness triggers more resources to go into gravisensing structures. Future experiments should investigate if the g-sensing threshold in space might be lower than the reference values (ca. 10-3 g) that were obtained from clinorotation experiments (Shen-Miller et al., 1968), which enhances starch degradation.     <P>
The examination of the cytoskeletal organization revealed less parallel microtubules (MTs) and thinner actin filaments (AFs) in space-grown material than in static ground controls. A forthcoming analysis will be based on studies of the alignment and consistency of MTs and AFs based on an ImageJ plug-in (Orientation-J) that computationally determines coherency (parallelism) and orientation of cytoskeletal proteins.   The first ground control was attempted August 13, 2014. Unfortunately, the compromised MFC (see flight experiment described above) released toxic (ammonia) fumes upon imbibition and the seeds failed to germinate.     <P>
In addition to the lack of germination, the clinorotation negatively affected the fixation system and RNALater leaked into the generic containment unit (GCU). Luckily, none of the electronics were affected and the ground control could be repeated with MFCs that were not exposed to RNALater.     <P>
Because of the failure to achieve germination, tests were done at the PI's lab that revealed additional, apparently clinorotation-specific problems. Although the seeds germinated, the apical hook formation was excessive and prevented the majority of the roots to extent toward the magnetized wedges. This condition was remedied by placing the seeds at the center of the germination paper in the seed cassettes. While this measure was a deviation from the original protocol, it provided data that allowed for a comparison between clinorotated and flight data. The advantage of the clinorotation of the original flight hardware was the imaging capability that is not available in the PI's lab.    <P>
Brassica rapa experiments were replicated twice in a second MFC using the following conditions:  A)	Vertical, no magnets, no clinorotation ; B)	Vertical, with HGMF, no clinorotation ; C)	Clinorotation, no magnets (comparison to KSC experiment – MFC3) ; D)	Clinorotation, with HGMF (comparison to KSC experiment – MFC2).    <P>
The gene analyses from these experiments represent a comparison to the analyses obtained from the second ground control performed at KSC 1/7 to 1/9/2015. These data are still being analyzed but both germination and elongation-growth were nominal and therefore successful.      <P>
MFC2 contained the critical combination of HGMF and RNALater. Although significantly reduced in length, germination was not affected. Current analyses are underway to tease out which processes might be affected by ammonia exposure.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. As in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments.

						The last year of the funding period continued to focus on the biology of Brassica seeds and seedlings and tests, laboratory and procedural changes at KSC. Preparation to payload verification and gene expression and growth studies were performed in the PI’s lab.     <P>
KSC continued with the development of hardware, most notably the camera system, hardware integration, and MFC performance. The most important obstacle from last year's science verification test was the lack of seed germination. An extensive test of all involved parameters suggested that unknown volatile organic compounds (VOC's) were the reason for germination failure. Corrective measures included a preventative enclosure of activated carbon cloth (ACC), and changed washing and drying procedures. Tests after the implementation of these changes in triple sealed Generic Containment Unit (GCU) resulted in much improved germination to an extent that now the removal of ACC is being examined.    <P>
Recent advanced in the hardware development were complicated by a major systems failure during vibration tests. The experimental load exceeded the target load and resulted in breakage of the base plate, the loosening of the computer stack, failed MEDUSA motor, and leakage of MFC's. These problems are being corrected in time for a scheduled PVT in October 2013.    <P>
Activities in the PI lab focused on the storability of seedlings in RNALater, the longevity of formaldehyde-based fixative in the presence of rust derived from corroding magnets, immuno-staining procedures, and the detectability of gene expression changes associated with germination, gravitropic curvature, and growth. The effect of rust on fixation and staining was examined and found to be negligible when proper measures were implemented. These steps include washing of fixed material, frequent exchanges of buffer before sectioning and staining, and slightly modified staining protocols.   RNA studies showed that custom-made RNALater fixative induces osmotic responses that lead to the degradation of some of the RNA. The continuation of solid phase gene extraction led to a precise description of temporal and spatial changes in gene expression in roots corresponding to those that will be used for the flight experiment. A paper describing these relationships has been submitted for publication. Original studies with a Labchip 90 system have now been continued with a different but related system (Qiaxcel). We were able to characterize the quality of mRNA that was extracted from young (< 5d old) roots. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. As in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments. Additional benefits of the project include training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. <P></td>

						The activities in 2011/2012 included two aspects: furthering the understanding of the biology of Brassica seeds and seedlings in the PI’s lab and preparations for test at KSC.    <P>
The activities related to science verification and biocompatibility test were performed at KSC and UL Lafayette.    <P>
After extensive preparation including optimization of watering volume, fixation times, and storage conditions, a science verification test (SVT) was attempted in Oct 2011. Despite numerous tests in the PI’s lab where germination and root elongation occurred even after 12 week storage in Magnetic Field Chambers (MFCs), the germination rate at KSC during the attempted SVT was zero and prompted a massive investigation concerning the root cause of the failed SVT.    <P>
Since a likely inhibitor of germination includes undesirable levels of organic volatile compounds (VOCs), an analysis of the gas phase was attempted and resulted in elevated levels of ethylene, CO2, and benzyl butyl phthalate. The levels varied between magnetic and non-magnetic chambers and suggested that the mounting of the magnets, the securing of magnets with RVT (silicon compound), recent spray-painting of covers, and/or washing procedures are possible causes for the lack of germination. The extended exposure in a triple sealed container the Generic Containment Unit (GCU) further complicated the precise identification of the problem.    <P>
Subsequent tests attempted to identify the contributions of all parts of the MFCs to which the seeds were exposed. Testing of two types of RVT (3145 & 3140), gasket and Lexan material as well as tubing and paper turned out negative.     <P>
Possible differences between the two types of MFCs (legacy and newly made) were explored but were inconclusive. A possibility (still under investigation) includes imprecise seating of the fill plugs that could have formed incomplete seals and thus allowed a higher gas exchange than the new chambers.   The situation was complicated further by an unexpected event resulting in the magnetic attachment of the new MFCs. As a result, the PI’s MFCs were shipped to KSC and used in subsequent tests. The joined MFCs still await attempts to separate them.    <P>
After introducing activated carbon cloth (ACC), the germination rate improved dramatically. This observation resulted in a modification to the MFCs that includes ACC for future tests. One test with storage of 23 d prior to imbibition resulted in germination but shorter than expected root length. Further tweaking of the amount of ACC and activation procedure is likely to result in germination rates that were obtained in fresh controls.    <P>
With the progress in germination, optimization of fixative and storage conditions, a second SVT is scheduled to begin July 12, 2012.    <P>
Research activities in the PI lab dealt with related problems: the storability of specimen in RNALater, the longevity of formaldehyde-based fixative in the presence of corroding NdFeB magnets, immune-staining procedures, and the detectability of gene expression changes associated with germination, gravitropic curvature, and growth. In addition, related research studied the effect of mechanostimulation on the formation of apoptotic cells in the Brassica columella.    <P>
RNALater studies showed that the custom preparation of the fixative was superior to the commercially available product in long-term experiments. However, the process of fixation seems to degrade RNA before the preservative effects are fully realized. Current research is trying to determine if the loss of apparent quality is the result of mRNA or ribosomal RNA degradation. Studies with a RNA analyzer (Labchip 90) showed that both fractions are affected but that mRNA is less degraded than the total RNA fraction. The delivered and soon to be activated Qiagen system (QIAxcel  RNA and DNA analyzer) will confirm the sensitivity of fresh material to the (slow) exposure to RNALater. So far, the results of these studies indicate significant variability to the exposure to RNALater but not the duration of preservation of the biological material (whole brassica seedlings). One problem for subsequent processing of preserved RNA is the removal of the high salt concentration for down-stream analysis (Q-PCR, agarose electrophoresis etc.).  The storage conditions of formaldehyde fixed material in corroded NdFeB magnet material was tested by storing formaldehyde-fixed material in the presence of magnet fragments. The discoloration of the solution was significant. However, despite a tougher (leathery) of root tissue, subsequent immune-staining was relatively unaffected. These data indicate that corrosion mainly affects the surface but not the internal cellular structure of root cells.      <P>
The testing of Q-PCR-based gene-expression analyses showed that RNALater-fixed material is suitable for gene-expression studies. We are still ‘calibrating’ the expression data against the effect of RNALater fixation.    <P>
Studies of apoptosis as a consequence of mechanostimulation are relevant because of the reduction of mechanostimulation in space environment (only internal, cellular events will affect mechanosensors). Clinorotation (substitute but reproducible mechanostimulation) showed enhanced sensitivity of roots to stimuli (enhanced curvature with higher angular velocity). The next step of this analysis will include gene expression studies after clinorotation.    <P>
More refined investigations of the organization of the root cap cytoskeleton (based on a new plug-in for ImageJ, OrientationJ) is suitable for cytoskeletal orientation analysis of individual cells and can reveal the correlation between f-actin and tubulin organization.   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. Like in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments. Additional benefits of the project include training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. <P></td>

Therefore, biological questions are investigated in conjunction with physical principles. We intent to analyze the effect of static magnetic fields on biological systems. This work will provide a starting point for the current discussion of the detrimental effects of (electro)magnetic fields.

The team consists of the support group at KSC (Howard Levine, Ralph Fritsche, Charlie Quincy, Trevor Murdoch, Natasha Rapp, David Reed), and the PI team (Karl H. Hasenstein, Andrea Edge (graduate student), and Myoung Roul Park (post-doctoral scientist). Dr. Park joined the PI team March 2011.    <P>
The team addressed three main objectives:   1)	Biological Studies ;   2)	Hardware development ;   3)	Development of experimental protocols for ground studies and flight experiment.     <P>
Biological studies:   We determined germination requirements, seed adhesion, imbibition duration, germination, temperature sensitivity of root elongation, and fixation conditions.  Growth tests were started immediately after the grant was initiated. We used existing Magnetic Field Chambers (MFCs) and Seed Cassettes (legacy design) at the PI lab. The tests were continued once modified seed cassettes became available.     <P>
The required water volume for germination was examined and we found that a single dispensation of 400 µl water produced optimal germination and growth provisions. This volume was sufficient to provide moisture for the entire growth duration and supported growth for a root length of more than 5 cm, a size greater than what was required for the projected experiment.  Demonstration of seed germination after imbibing two seed/paper sandwiches with 400 µl water. The resulting images illustrate uniform germination, root hair formation, and root extension between paper as a result of gravitropic curvature of those roots that germinated in an inverted orientation.    <P>
Seed Adhesion:  The small seed size and their uniform round shape make precise positioning of the seeds very difficult without proper and reliable adhesion of seeds to the substrate. We tested guar gum, gelatin, guar/gelatin mixtures, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as well as guar gum and PVA mixtures as adhesives. The most reliable adhesion that did not negatively affect seed germination was obtained with 20% PVA (Mowiol) and commercially available Elmer’s School Glue. This compound dries clear, is non-toxic, and eventually water soluble (‘washable’). Seeds attached with this glue showed no measurable delay in germination, no reduced growth rate, but the seed coat remained attached to the germination paper better than any other tested glue. In addition, the placement of the seeds toward the center of the paper sandwich, about 1 mm away from the paper edge provided greater reliability because emerging root hairs interact with the paper and further stabilize seed attachment.     <P>
Fixation in seed cassettes inside MFCs with 70% ethanol or aqueous buffers with formaldehyde and extensive manual shaking did not dislodge seeds. Despite the delay in obtaining new (MFCs) with properly spaced wedges, Teflon coating, and sealed covers delayed fixation studies but temporary fixes and necessary biocompatibility tests showed that seed germination is robust in a regular lab system (Petri dishes) and MFCs. Storing seeds in MFCs for 3 months did not reduce subsequent germination rate or cause slower root growth.    <P>
Temperature dependency of germination and root elongation was tested and resulted in a maximum growth rate at 30C. Lower and higher temperatures reduced root growth. A combined algorithm was developed that describes root growth as a sum of temperature and time with the following equation:     <P>
Growth   = (-0.0033 {temp}^2+0.191{temp}-2.15)×{time} + 0.36×{temp} -19    <P>
This relationship explains ~90% of the experimental variability; the coefficients will be further refined as more experiments will be conducted.    <P>
Cytoskeletal Staining Protocols:  One of the objectives of the flight experiment is the determination of the influence of microgravity on cell growth, and the cytoskeletal organization. Therefore a reliable staining protocol had to be developed that takes into account the peculiar circumstances of the experiment (preparation of fixative, the duration for which reliable fixation can be achieved) and the ability to store fixed tissue in fixative without negatively affecting subsequent staining procedures.   Therefore, we tested different concentrations of formaldehyde fixative (1, 2, and 4%) and different storage combinations (fixative storage before use and storage of tissue in fixative after fixation). So far, optimal fixation conditions were achieved by keeping fixative for three weeks or less before fixation (at room temperature). Suitable staining could be achieved with root tissue stored up to four weeks in fixative that was stored three weeks prior to fixation. While the schedule is complex and needs to consider time (as limiting factor before formaldehyde polymerizes and therefore loses its ability to cross-link) and temperature, which affects polymerization, a decline in the fixation is not precipitous and does not affect all tissue equally.    <P>
Microtubule staining was accomplished with primary antibody YOL-1/34 and secondary antibody rabbit anti-rat IgG (labeled with Alexa 488). The protocol followed standard lab procedures and resulted in reliable staining. Initial attempts to label F-actin with Rhodamin-phalloidin failed despite multiple trials. We then tested mouse mAB anti-actin Clone C4 with goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa 546 as secondary antibody. This protocol resulted in good staining of F-actin.    <P>
Starch staining and identification:  The ability to localize starch in columella cells and the possible modification that starch experiences in microgravity conditions prompted an ongoing investigation into the labeling of different starch types that also characterizes starch composition. Incubation of starch in dyes such as Safranin B,  Alcian Blue, Basic Fuchsin, or combinations thereof, stain starch and produce fluorescence (lambda>515 nm). Staining of raw starch and Spurr-embedded samples indicate that starch analysis is possible.    <P>
Gene expression studies:  A significant aspect of the proposed research concerns the effect of microgravity and HGMF on gene expression in growing roots. We selected genes that represent auxin transport, starch and carbohydrate metabolism, the cytoskeleton, and reference genes.    <P>
The quality of the mRNA depends greatly on the storage condition after the flight experiment has been completed. Therefore, we tested the effect of storing tissue under various conditions and for extended times in RNA-Later. We compared commercially prepared RNA-Later with in-house prepared solutions and determined that our own preparation is superior to the commercial fixative     <P>
In addition to the extraction procedure, we tested the gene expression patterns in extracts. These expression patterns compared two reference genes (ubiquitin and actin-7) to other genes based on the storage condition of the tissue.   While the complete representation of all data is beyond the scope of this report, the data clearly indicate that gene sequences degraded at different rates.    <P>
Hardware development:  The difference between the legacy and newly designed cassettes were a 5-channel design to accommodate ten instead of 8 seeds, better connection between cover and base, and larger inner space to accommodate a double germination paper sandwich.  The newly designed Magnetic Field Chambers (MFCs) were analyzed for the reproducibility of the magnetic properties. While the spacing of the wedges resulted in an equidistant positioning of the maximum field strength, the intensity was not uniform. However, resulting gradient were similar.   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This proposal combines morphological measurements on micro-gravity germinated and grown (Brassica) roots that are exposed to high-gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) with a high-resolution spatial analysis of genes involved in gravitropism. Magnetic gradients exert a repulsive force on diamagnetic substances such as the starch in amyloplasts, which results in gravitropic-like curvature. The proposal is based on hardware that was developed for a previous flight experiment on STS-107. Like in the originally proposed experiment, microscopic analysis of amyloplast size and distribution will be studied in the context of achieved curvature. In addition, high-resolution genetic profiling will be conducted that focuses on the cytoskeleton and starch development. The result of the proposed work will enable directional growth of seedlings and eventually mature plants under microgravity conditions using HGMF. Three conditions will be used to differentiate microgravity from uniform magnetic fields and HGMF conditions. Only HGMF is expected to  influence root curvature. A uniform magnetic field will serve as control for possible secondary magnetic effects. This condition will be compared to an in-flight control without magnetic field to determine growth rate, gene expression, growth, and directionality (autotropism). Root material from these experiments will be used for investigations on cytoskeletal organization and the expression of  starch-related genes. A second aspect of the proposed work will investigate the process of gravisensing, whether dependent on amyloplast position, movement, or force exerted onto amyloplasts. Space experimentation is necessary to establish a threshold value for a directional magnetic force. In addition to providing insight in the fundamental mechanism of the gravisensing system of plants, the data from this experiment can be used to develop technology to provide a directional, gravity-like stimulus to plants during early stages of germination. The proposed experiment can be performed with existing hardware, be adapted easily to changing flight schedules, and requires minimal crew time. The anticipated benefits include a better understanding of root development, effects of amyloplast displacement on root development and curvature, and compensatory measures to alleviate microgravity conditions. A newly developed gene extraction technology is ideally suited for gene-profiling studies and has far-reaching implications for studying gene expression, especially for confined space flight experiments. Additional benefits of the project include training of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. <P></td>
