                    <td colspan="3"> This research seeks to define the intra-/inter-cellular mechanisms behind the generation and transmission of the gravity signal. It is widely accepted that sedimentation of starch filled amyloplasts in the columella of the root cap and endodermis of the hypocotyl act to initiate the gravitropic signal. However, although pH and Ca2+-based signals have been proposed as key elements in this plant response, the precise mechanisms translating physical force to biochemically transmissible signal is still poorly defined. Needed is a high resolution spatiotemporal map of changes in ion activities induced by the gravity signal. Such mapping will be achieved by confocal imaging of plants expressing a range of GFP-based probes targeted to different subcellular locales within the Arabidopsis seedling. In parallel, we will use machine-vision technologies to quantify the distribution of curvature along the root and hypocotyl axes during gravitropism. Curvature and ion change distribution maps will be measured in wild type and mutants known to be defective in the pathways that lead to gravity signal transduction. By mapping the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of ion signaling to these morphometric analyses, we will be able to pinpoint where and when each component is altering tropic response.    <P>
Potential for translation to future spaceflight opportunities: These studies will develop a morphometric technology highly applicable to spaceflight analysis where existing hardware can be used to collect the time-lapse imaging required for morphometric analysis. Such analysis will develop a quantitative description of the effects of the flight environment on plant development at levels of architecture ranging from branching patterns to the kinematics of growth. This will allow us to ask questions only addressable by the unique environment of Space; for example, defining the effects of mutations on gravitational response thresholds. <P></td>

						This grant covered research to map the dynamics of ionic signaling associated with gravity sensing and response. We have used this analysis to assess how well such signaling events can be linked to the control of plant development and to gain insight into the initial signaling events related to gravity perception in plants. Major goals have been to: (1) develop the imaging approaches to monitor Ca2+ signaling dynamics in wild type plants and in a range of gravitropism-related mutant backgrounds, (2) apply high-resolution growth analyses to correlate signaling events to growth control, and (3) characterize the potential for cross-talk between gravitropic signaling and other response systems.    <P>
 (A) Rapid and asymmetrical Ca2+ changes accompany gravity perception in the root.  We have used plants transformed with the GFP-based Ca2+ imaging probe cameleon YC3.6 to image the Ca2+ changes occurring in response to a range of abiotic stresses as well as gravistimulation (gravistimulation applied by rotation of the plant through 90 degrees). This sensor allowed us to resolve changes in Ca2+ levels in plants exhibiting gravitropic signaling/response with the major Ca2+ change occurring 10 minutes after gravistimulation. The timing of these changes was significant after the initiation of gravity response and we concluded most likely linked to the auxin-dependent machinery controlling growth responses, i.e. a late event in the gravitropic response following the initial events of perception. However, Ca2+ reporters with much higher sensitivities, the ‘YC-nanos’, have become available during this work and we have generated plants expressing a range of these sensors. Using these probes, we have been able to monitor Ca2+ changes that were previously undetected, most likely due to their much lower magnitude than required to alter YC3.6 signals. These Ca2+ changes occur in the lateral root cap and in the root cap columella (site of gravity perception) within 0.5-1 min of gravistimulation. This time-frame is within the presentation time of Arabidopsis, i.e. within the timing predicted for the generation of gravity signal transduction in the root cap.     <P>
Unexpectedly, Ca2+ increases are also seen in mutants such as adg1 that lack starch and so are thought to not generate a directional signal to gravity in the root cap. However, the Ca2+ changes in these mutants are not linked to gravistimulation, occurring in a random pattern at the root tip in both vertically grown and gravistimulated plants. These results suggest that the starch filled amyloplasts in the root cap may be acting to localize gravitropic Ca2+-related signals in the sensory cells of the root tip and that without this strong directional component being maintained by the dense starch, the amyloplast membranes are free to interact with receptors at random. These random interactions would then generate the non-directional Ca2+ signals seen in the starchless mutants. This data supports the classic "starch-statolith" model where the mass of the starch in amyloplasts is required to reinforce the directional component of the gravity signaling system but is not required to trigger the perception machinery per se. Morphometric and kinematic analysis of the regional growth response of the root indicates all these Ca2+ changes occur well before gravitropic growth is detectable and they occur in regions of the root tip that do not show detectable cell elongation in response to gravistimulation. These data all suggest that these Ca2+ changes are likely part of the initial signaling events of gravitropic response.    <P>
(B) Mutants in a range of Ca2+-related proteins alter gravitropic response.  In addition to analyzing a range of gravitropic response mutants such as adg1 we have also screened mutants in Ca2+-related proteins (e.g., Ca2+ transporters and Ca2+-binding proteins that are highly expressed in the root tip) for potential effects on gravitropic response. This has defined two Ca2+ transporters (ACA1 and CAX2) and the "touch-related" genes TCH1, TCH2, and TCH3 as showing reduced gravitropic response. Mutants in the Ca2+ transporters alter root tip Ca2+ signal dynamics, providing a likely link to their effects on growth. These transporters also play a role in anoxic response of the root, with the mutants showing resistance to anoxic challenge, providing a point of cross-talk between gravitropic signaling and root zone anoxia. A major limitation to root growth in spaceflight is thought to be root zone hypoxia/anoxia and so interactions between this signaling system and that of the gravitropic response have a potentially important influence on plant growth in microgravity.    <P>
The 'touch' genes (TCH1, 2, and 3) were identified from their transcriptional upregulation in response to mechanical stimulation but a role in gravitropic response has not been reported to date. We have determined that loss-of-function mutants in these genes show reduced gravitropic response but we have detected no clear alteration in Ca2+ signaling dynamics in these backgrounds. These observations suggest that these genes act downstream of the Ca2+ change, consistent with a role in interpreting the Ca2+ changes. All three of these TCH genes contain a Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. The touch-sensitivity of these genes also suggests a role in mechanical responses, suggesting they may act as a point of cross-talk between the mechanical and gravity sensing systems of the plant.    <P>
 (C) Hypergravity experiments support the need for sedimented amyloplasts in the gravity signaling system.   As part of our analysis of the initial gravity sensing machinery, we have been collaborating with Dr. Masatsugu Toyota and the lab of Miyo Morita (NAIST, Japan) in using a centrifuge microscope to define whether amyloplast directional movements are linked to graviresponse as well as characterizing the likely role of starch in this process. This new microscope allowed imaging of amyloplast movements while stems were experiencing up to 30xG. This analysis revealed that sedimentary movements of amyloplasts under hypergravity conditions are linearly correlated with gravitropic curvature in wild-type stems. It also showed that agravitropic mutants such as sgr2 and sgr9 have immobile amyloplasts at 1xG but their gravitropic response could be rescued by growing them at 10-30 x G. This rescuing of the mutant phenotype correlated with the G force required to force their amyloplasts to sediment. Similarly, starch deficient mutants have their graviresponse rescued by the increasing G-forces that caused sedimentation even of starchless plastids. These results lend further support to the “static” or “settled” statolith model where amyloplasts in the sensory cells must sediment to the lower face of the cell to elicit a gravitropic signal, consistent with the Ca2+ signaling responses to gravistimulation. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research seeks to define the intra-/inter-cellular mechanisms behind the generation and transmission of the gravity signal. It is widely accepted that sedimentation of starch filled amyloplasts in the columella of the root cap and endodermis of the hypocotyl act to initiate the gravitropic signal. However, although pH and Ca2+-based signals have been proposed as key elements in this plant response, the precise mechanisms translating physical force to biochemically transmissible signal is still poorly defined. Needed is a high resolution spatiotemporal map of changes in ion activities induced by the gravity signal. Such mapping will be achieved by confocal imaging of plants expressing a range of GFP-based probes targeted to different subcellular locales within the Arabidopsis seedling. In parallel, we will use machine-vision technologies to quantify the distribution of curvature along the root and hypocotyl axes during gravitropism. Curvature and ion change distribution maps will be measured in wild type and mutants known to be defective in the pathways that lead to gravity signal transduction. By mapping the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of ion signaling to these morphometric analyses, we will be able to pinpoint where and when each component is altering tropic response.    <P>
Potential for translation to future spaceflight opportunities: These studies will develop a morphometric technology highly applicable to spaceflight analysis where existing hardware can be used to collect the time-lapse imaging required for morphometric analysis. Such analysis will develop a quantitative description of the effects of the flight environment on plant development at levels of architecture ranging from branching patterns to the kinematics of growth. This will allow us to ask questions only addressable by the unique environment of Space; for example, defining the effects of mutations on gravitational response thresholds. <P></td>

						This grant covers research to map the dynamics of ionic signaling associated with gravity sensing and response onto the kinetics of gravitropic growth. We are using this analysis to assess how well such signaling events can be linked to the control of plant development. Over the last year we have been able to: (1) image Ca2+ signaling events in wild type plants and in a range of mutant backgrounds, (2) apply high-resolution kinematic analyses of cell-level growth in these plants, and (3) characterize the potential for cross-talk between anoxic and gravitropic signaling and response.    <P>
(1)	Ca2+ signaling events in the gravitropic response.  We have previously used plants transformed with the GFP-based Ca2+ sensitive protein cameleon YC3.6 to image the Ca2+ changes occurring upon gravistimulation (applied by rotation of the plant through 90 degrees) using confocal imaging. This sensor allowed us to resolve a major Ca2+ change occurring 5-10 minutes after gravistimulation. This change is asymmetrical, being localized to the lower face of the root cap and oscillates with a 5 minute periodicity. The timing of these changes suggest that they play a role in assymetrical auxin transport in the root tip.	    <P>
However, ‘YC-nanos’, Ca2+ reporters with much higher sensitivities (i.e. able to resolve much lower amplitude Ca2+ increases), are now available and we have generated plants expressing a range of these sensors, including YC-nano140 and YC-nano65. Using these probes, we have been able to monitor an array of Ca2+ changes that were previously undetected. These Ca2+ changes occur in the root cap columella (site of gravity perception) and in the lateral root cap cells within 2 minutes of gravistimulation. This time-frame is within the presentation time for Arabidopsis, i.e. it is within the timing predicted for the generation of gravity signal transduction in the root cap. Prominent Ca2+ increases also occur on the lower side of the root cap in lateral root cap cells. After 10 minutes, the changes seen with YC3.6 were also observed with these new sensors, suggesting that the reason we see many more Ca2+ changes with the YC-nanos is their superior sensitivity.    <P>
We have therefore transformed these new Ca2+ sensors into plants where the gravitropic signaling is predicted to be disrupted. Our initial analyses indicate such Ca2+ signaling is altered in the pgm1-1 and adg1-1 mutants. These mutants are defective in starch synthesis in the root cap. This work is beginning to suggest a relationship between Ca2+ signaling in the root cap and the starch statolith mechanism of sedimentable starch-filled amyloplasts that is predicted to underlie initial gravisensing events in plants.    <P>
We have also been collaborating with the lab of Janet Braam (Rice University) on imaging Ca2+ signaling in calmodulin-like protein mutants that likely form part of the response network for Ca2+ signaling changes. We have determined that one such mutant (cml24) has effects on root growth, leading to root skewing, cell file rotation and altered microtubule orientation, suggesting a model whereby Ca2+ and CML24 act to control microtubule function and so contribute to the control of root directional growth. Although CML24 mutants are affected in root growth and root touch responses, they show no lesion in root gravitropism and no clear alteration in Ca2+ signals as monitored by YC3.6.    <P>
(2)	Kinematic analyses of gravitropic responses.  In collaboration with Dr. Nathan Miller in the Spalding lab, we have been applying software that allows the automated analysis of regional growth rates over the surface of the root. The analysis program is helping define when and where on the surface of the root gravitropic growth responses are detectable. We are using this mapping to drive where we are concentrating on analyzing the dynamics of Ca2+ responses after the initial gravisignaling events (that occur over the first 5 minutes) have been generated and the cell elongation phase of gravity response is initiated. In wild-type plants we have monitored an extended Ca2+ increase on the lower side of the root at this time period coinciding with the initiation of asymmetrical growth. Using this approach, we have also mapped responses in the pgm1-1 and adg1-1 mutants. Although the pgm1-1 and adg1-1 mutants are knockouts for these two starch biosynthetic genes, their agravitropic phenotypes are actually conditional, being rescued by supplementation of sugars to the medium. The sugars likely bypass these mutations and facilitate starch deposition in the root cap. Our kinematic analyses of these mutants under conditions where they show reduced gravitropism has pinpointed where the local reductions in regional growth that underlie the slower bending response of the roots occur. We are currently using mutant lines expressing YC-nano140 and YC-nano65 to ask how the Ca2+ signaling in these roots is altered and whether this correlates with these sites of reduced tropic response.    <P>
(3) Role of anoxia on root gravitropic growth responses.  During our analysis of gravitropic growth, we have become increasingly aware that root zone hypoxia/anoxia alters the kinetics of the response. In addition, we have also characterized, using our YC-nano-expressing plants, that anoxia due to poor oxygenation of growth media leads to a complex Ca2+ signaling response in the root tip, especially in the columella cells, the cells responsible for gravity sensing. Our mining of the publicly available transcriptional databases suggests that Ca2+ response proteins such as the calcium-dependent protein kinases, calmodulin-like proteins and Ca2+ transporters of the ACA and CAX family are highly over-represented in datasets from anoxia-treated plants. At a practical level, we now know that anoxic response can trigger Ca2+ changes in the root that may confound analysis of gravitropic signaling and so we take measures to ensure normoxic conditions for the root zone in our experiments. However, we also hypothesize that anoxic Ca2+ signaling may be involved in rewiring the Ca2+ response machinery to gravitropic Ca2+ signals. Unexpectedly, we have found that mutants in ACA1 and CAX2 are both resistant to anoxia and show reduced gravitropic response suggesting they may play roles in the Ca2+ signaling seen in both processes. Kinematic analyses of the regional growth rates of these mutants is being performed to map the cellular basis for their reduced bending response.    <P>
We are currently generating aca1 and cax2 lines expressing the YC-nano sensors to ask how these affect gravitropism-related Ca2+ signaling. Root zone hypoxia is predicted to be an important issue when growing plants under microgravity as buoyancy-driven convective gas mixing is lost in these conditions and so oxygen supply to the root becomes limiting. Thus, these interactions between anoxia and tropic signaling may have important implications for optimally growing plants in the spaceflight environment.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research will address program priority 1 in the plant biology element of this NRA by seeking to define the intra-/inter-cellular mechanisms behind the generation and transmission of the gravity signal. It is widely accepted that sedimentation of starch filled amyloplasts in the columella of the root cap and endodermis of the hypocotyl act to initiate the gravitropic signal. However, although pH and Ca2+-based signals have been proposed as key elements in this plant response, the precise mechanisms translating physical force to biochemically transmissible signal is still poorly defined. Needed is a high resolution spatiotemporal map of changes in ion activities induced by the gravity signal. Such mapping will be achieved by confocal imaging of plants expressing a range of GFP-based probes targeted to different subcellular locales within the Arabidopsis seedling. In parallel, we will use machine-vision technologies to quantify the distribution of curvature along the root and hypocotyl axes during gravitropism. Curvature and ion change distribution maps will be measured in wild type and mutants known to be defective in the pathways that lead to gravity signal transduction. By mapping the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of ion signaling to these morphometric analyses, we will be able to pinpoint where and when each component is altering tropic response.    <P>
Potential for translation to future spaceflight opportunities: These studies will develop a morphometric technology highly applicable to spaceflight analysis where existing hardware can be used to collect the time-lapse imaging required for morphometric analysis. Such  analysis will develop a quantitative description of the effects of the flight environment on plant development at levels of architecture ranging from branching patterns to the kinematics of growth. This will allow us to ask questions only addressable by the unique environment of Space, for example defining the effects of mutations on gravitational response thresholds. <P></td>

						This grant covers research to map the dynamics of ionic signaling associated with gravity sensing and response onto the kinetics of gravitropic growth. This analysis will be used to assess how well such signaling events can be linked to the control of plant development. Over the last year we have concentrated on: (1) completing a catalog of morphometric analysis of gravitropic growth responses from the root systems of a range of gravity and growth response mutants in Arabidopsis and (2) simultaneously imaging ionic signaling events in wild type plants and in these mutant backgrounds (3) developing high-resolution kinematic analyses of cell-level growth in these plants and (4) characterizing the effects of medium composition and especially potential anoxic effects on these responses.    <P>
(1)	Defining gravitropic growth kinetics in wild type and gravitropism-related mutants.  We have completed a high-resolution morphometric analysis of gravitropic response in wild-type Arabidopsis in a range of ecotypes to define the natural variability in “wild-type” response and also analyzed a range of mutants to define precisely where in time and space in their gravitropic response they exhibit alteration in growth control. We have analyses of mutants including pgm1 (which has a lesion in phosphogucomutase and so is unable to lay down starch in the gravity sensing cells), aux1 (which has a lesion in an auxin influx transporter that disrupts auxin-related events associated with gravity responses), arg1 (lesion in a DNAJ protein that acts in the gravity sensory cells of the root cap) and mar1 and mar2 both alone and in the arg1 background (MAR1 and 2 are proteins found in the plastid membrane possibly playing a role in gravity sensing). Interestingly, and for unknown reasons at present, mar1 and mar2 mutants only exhibit effects on gravitropic growth response when a mutation in arg1 is also present. However, we have now characterized that alone mar1 exhibits a reversal in gravitropic response in the root which is dependent on light level. This appears to represent an interaction of gravitropic and phototropic response. Current work is aimed at defining the precise light dependency with regard to wavelength and possible involvement of phototropic receptors such as the phototropins (blue light) or phytochromes (red light sensors).     <P>
We have also tested response to different growth conditions, concentrating on sucrose supplementation to the medium. This analysis has allowed us to define that the mutants in phosphogucomutase that are characterized as showing reduced gravitropism (thought to be due to a defect in laying down starch required for perception in the gravity sensing cells) actually show a conditional phenotype with higher levels of sucrose progressively suppressing the gravitropic phenotype and moving more and more to wild-type-like response kinetics. This rescue saturates around 5 mM sucrose. This level of sucrose is much less than the 30 mM usually added to assay media. We speculate that this recovery of gravitropic response is linked to an alternate pathway of starch deposition that bypasses the phosphoglucomutase-dependent step and that is facilitated by increased sucrose levels. We are currently verifying this sucrose-dependent starch deposition. If this hypothesis is correct it could help explain the residual gravitropic response seen in many experiments with these phosphoglucomutase mutants. This residual gravitropic response remains one of the observations that is proposed to contradict the predictions of the most widely held model for plant gravity perception, the starch statolith hypothesis where starch in the plastids is required to elicit graviperception.    <P>
(2)	Developing cellular imaging approaches to capture early signaling events in the gravitropic response.  We have transformed the GFP-based Ca2+ imaging probe cameleon YC3.6 into the mutant backgrounds described above and into 8 different “wild-type” ecotypes of Arabidopsis for which we have morphometric growth data and are currently imaging the Ca2+ changes occurring upon gravistimulation (applied by rotation of the plant through 90 degrees) using confocal imaging. We have also investigated whether measurements would be more readily made using the alternate Ca2+ imaging probe aequorin. Aequorin is a luminescent protein that is responsive to Ca2+ levels, and has advantages of being less sensitive to artifacts related to shifts in imaging plane that occur as gravistimulation is applied than GFP-based probes. We have therefore characterized plants stably transformed with this probe driven by a ubiquitously expressed promoter (the 35S promoter). Our analysis of the aequorin plants suggests signal strength is severely limiting for detection of Ca2+ changes to all but the largest, most widespread Ca2+ signals such as generated by cold-shock, mechanical stimulation or chemical elicitors such as extracellular ATP and does not resolve Ca2+ changes elicited by gravitropic stimulation. We therefore optimized the confocal imaging of the YC3.6 lines to be able to resolve rapid changes in Ca2+ levels in plants exhibiting gravitropic signaling/response and to minimize any focal plane shifts that occur as gravistimulation is applied. Our analysis suggests multiple Ca2+ signals separated in time occur in the root cap upon this stimulation. The major Ca2+ change occurs 10 minutes after gravistimulation, is asymmetrical and limited to one or two cells in the lateral root cap on the lower side of the root. These cells exhibit complex Ca2+ oscillations. The delayed response of these cells suggests the changes play a role in signal export, possibly related to auxin transport in the root cap and coincide with the first detectable growth responses of the root as defined by our morphometric and kinematic analysis. However, detailed analysis of the kinetics of auxin response reporters such as the DR5 promoter indicate these are detectably activated more than 2 hours after these signals have occurred.    <P>
	As part of the development of this Ca2+ imaging technology, we have been using the addition of extracellular ATP as a positive control. Extracellular ATP is an emerging regulator of plant growth, with mounting evidence for a role in gravitropic response. In collaboration with the laboratories of Gary Stacey (University of Missouri, Columbia) and Alan Jones (UNC) we have characterized an oscillatory Ca2+ response to this ATP treatment that appears dependent on signaling through a G-protein signal transduction element. This characterization has been published in Plant Physiology. We have also introduced the YC3.6 sensor into mutants of the G-protein complex to assess the cell-type specific nature of these signaling systems.    <P>
We have also been collaborating with the lab of Janet Braam (Rice University) on imaging Ca2+ signaling in calmodulin-like protein mutants that likely form part of the response network for Ca2+ signaling changes. We have determined that one such mutant (cml24) has effects on root growth, leading to root skewing, cell file rotation and altered microtubule orientation, suggesting a model whereby Ca2+ and CML24 act to control microtubule function and so contribute to the control of root directional growth. This work has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Plant Growth Regulation.    <P>
3) Role of anoxia on root gravitropic growth responses.  During our analysis of gravitropic growth, we have become increasingly aware that root zone hypoxia/anoxia alters the kinetics of the response. In addition, we have also characterized, using our YC3.6-expressig plants, that anoxia due to poor oxygenation of growth media leads to a complex Ca2+ signaling response in the root tip. Our mining of the publicly available transcriptional databases suggests that Ca2+ response proteins such as the calcium-dependent protein kinases, calmodulin-like proteins and Ca2+ transporters such as the CAX family are highly represented in datasets from anoxia-treated plants. At a practical level for experimentation, anoxic response may therefore act to both trigger Ca2+ changes in the root that may confound analysis of gravitropic signaling response and also rewire the Ca2+ response machinery to gravitropic Ca2+ signals. In addition, a major limitation to root growth in spaceflight is thought to be root zone hypoxia/anoxia.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research will address program priority 1 in the plant biology element of this NRA by seeking to define the intra-/inter-cellular mechanisms behind the generation and transmission of the gravity signal. It is widely accepted that sedimentation of starch filled amyloplasts in the columella of the root cap and endodermis of the hypocotyl act to initiate the gravitropic signal. However, although pH and Ca2+-based signals have been proposed as key elements in this plant response, the precise mechanisms translating physical force to biochemically transmissible signal is still poorly defined. Needed is a high resolution spatiotemporal map of changes in ion activities induced by the gravity signal. Such mapping will be achieved by confocal imaging of plants expressing a range of GFP-based probes targeted to different subcellular locales within the Arabidopsis seedling. In parallel, we will use machine-vision technologies to quantify the distribution of curvature along the root and hypocotyl axes during gravitropism. Curvature and ion change distribution maps will be measured in wild type and mutants known to be defective in the pathways that lead to gravity signal transduction. By mapping the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of ion signaling to these morphometric analyses, we will be able to pinpoint where and when each component is altering tropic response.    <P>
Potential for translation to future spaceflight opportunities: These studies will develop a morphometric technology highly applicable to spaceflight analysis where existing hardware can be used to collect the time-lapse imaging required for morphometric analysis. Such  analysis will develop a quantitative description of the effects of the flight environment on plant development at levels of architecture ranging from branching patterns to the kinematics of growth. This will allow us to ask questions only addressable by the unique environment of Space, for example defining the effects of mutations on gravitational response thresholds. <P></td>

						This grant covers research to map the dynamics of ionic signaling associated with gravity sensing and response onto the kinetics of gravitropic growth to assess how well such signaling events can be linked to the control of plant development. We have concentrated on 2 of the major goals over the last year: (1) Developing a comprehensive catalog of gravitropic growth responses from the root systems of a range of mutants in Arabidopsis and (2) generating and optimizing the imaging tools for simultaneously monitoring ionic signaling events in wild type plants and in these mutant backgrounds.    <P>
We have applied morphometric analysis of movies of tropic response in wild-type Arabidopsis from a range of ecotypes to define the natural variability in “wild-type” response and to develop a comprehensive description of wild-type response in the ecotypic backgrounds relevant for comparison to the gravitropism mutants under study (which are in a variety of ecotype backgrounds). We have then applied similar analysis to these mutants to define precisely where in time and space in their gravitropic response they exhibit alteration in growth control. Current analysis has captured approximately 230 trials, which we have determined is providing the robust dataset needed for statistical analysis and have captured the response kinetics of mutants ranging from the starchless pgm1 (which has a lesion in gravity sensing), to arg (which has a lesion in a likely component of  the gravity sensor in the root cap), to aux1 (which is defective in auxin transport  and so in auxin-driven gravitropic response). During this analysis we have also tested response under different growth conditions, concentrating on sucrose  supplementation to the medium. This parameter is important as in the literature gravitropic response has been assayed under conditions of medium supplemented with sucrose ranging from 0 to 1% (0-33mM). As sucrose levels were increased in both wild-type and mutant plants, root growth rate also increased as did the rate of  apparent gravitropic response. The morphometric analysis of root gravitropic curvature also captures incremental growth rate allowing us to correct the gravitropic response for changes in growth rate at each data point. This has allowed us to ask whether a slower gravitropic reorientation of the root in a particular mutant simply reflects a slower growth rate rather than an alteration in the kinetics of response more likely linked to a lesion in a fundamental aspect of gravitropic signaling or growth control. Such analysis has allowed us to define the mutants pgm1, aux1 and arg1 and mar2 in the arg1  background (mar1 and 2 are proteins found in the plastid membrane possibly playing a role in gravity sensing) as showing alterations in gravitropic response that cannot be wholly accounted for by their effects on growth rate. However, except for aux1 which remains essentially agravitropic under all sucrose levels, these other mutants show alterations in gravitropic response that are all significantly modulated by the sucrose level in the medium. Thus, for example, at 0 mM sucrose the pgm1 mutant shows agravitropic growth, but as sucrose levels are increased, its response begins to resemble wild-type plants until at 10 mM sucrose it is indistinguishable from wild-type.    <P>
This morphometric analysis has provided us with a detailed map of growth responses in a range of gravitropic mutants onto which we can superimpose ionic signaling events (see below). The characterization of the sensitivity of gravitropic response to sucrose levels in the medium allows us to both compare our results to the those in the literature  and to manipulate the tropic response between large kinetic differences to wild type – e.g. pgm1 under low sucrose – to response kinetics indistinguishable form wild type – e.g. pgm1 under 10 mM sucrose. Such manipulation is allowing us to ask if alterations in signaling activities seen under these conditions translate into an alteration in the kinetics of tropic response. i.e. altered signaling seen at 0 mM sucrose in pgm1 that is lost at 10 mM sucrose is more likely to be linked to growth rather than a fundamental lesion in gravity sensing per se as 10 mM sucrose rescues gravitropic growth response in pgm1 to wild-type levels.    <P>
We have also been generating the ionic signaling probes to allow us to map changes in ion fluxes onto these growth kinetics. We have concentrated on 3 probes: the luminescent Ca2+ sensor aequorin, the fluorescent Ca2+ sensor YC3.6 and the fluorescent pH sensor GFP-H148D. These have been cloned and constructs developed with these proteins driven by promoters directing expression to either the whole plant, the root cap or the epidermis to ask if Ca2+ or pH changes in these regions of the plant occur as gravitropic signaling is initiated. At present these constructs are being transformed into wild-type plants and the gravitropic mutants outlined above.   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> This research will address program priority 1 in the plant biology element of this NRA by seeking to define the intra-/inter-cellular mechanisms behind the generation and transmission of the gravity signal. It is widely accepted that sedimentation of starch filled amyloplasts in the columella of the root cap and endodermis of the hypocotyl act to initiate the gravitropic signal. However, although pH and Ca2+-based signals have been proposed as key elements in this plant response, the precise mechanisms translating physical force to biochemically transmissible signal is still poorly defined. Needed is a high resolution spatiotemporal map of changes in ion activities induced by the gravity signal. Such mapping will be achieved by confocal imaging of plants expressing a range of GFP-based probes targeted to different subcellular locales within the Arabidopsis seedling. In parallel, we will use machine-vision technologies to quantify the distribution of curvature along the root and hypocotyl axes during gravitropism. Curvature and ion change distribution maps will be measured in wild type and mutants known to be defective in the pathways that lead to gravity signal transduction. By mapping the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of ion signaling to these morphometric analyses, we will be able to pinpoint where and when each component is altering tropic response.    <P>
Potential for translation to future spaceflight opportunities: These studies will develop a morphometric technology highly applicable to spaceflight analysis where existing hardware can be used to collect the time-lapse imaging required for morphometric analysis. Such  analysis will develop a quantitative description of the effects of the flight environment on plant development at levels of architecture ranging from branching patterns to the kinematics of growth. This will allow us to ask questions only addressable by the unique environment of Space, for example defining the effects of mutations on gravitational response thresholds. <P></td>
