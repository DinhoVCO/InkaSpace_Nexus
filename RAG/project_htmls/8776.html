The effects of microgravity on genotoxic response is important because NASA astronauts and personnel in microgravity will be exposed to significant genotoxic agents including chemicals (e.g. metals) and radiation and the potential for microgravity to exacerbate  the genotoxic outcome is poorly understood. The short term objective of this research is to initially focus on chromium (Cr) because it is one of the only metals with a well-established DNA repair response to genotoxicity that is also a component of lunar soil. We will investigate the central hypothesis that altered gravity potentiates metal ion- and particle-induced genotoxicity. We will test this  hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) Determine Altered Gravity Effects on Metal-induced DNA Damage Formation and Repair in Human Cells and 2) Determine if Altered Gravity Effects Are Conserved Across Cell Types and Species. These data when combined with our data generated by our studies of lunar dust in cells at normal gravity can be used to help determine appropriate exposure  limits to moon dust. Our data will also be the first to evaluate how altered gravity affects metal-induced DNA repair gene expression and signal transduction as well as effects on metal-induced apoptosis. These data will also indicate which responses are general and which are cell or species specific. Altogether, these data should provide important insight into the mechanisms of altered gravity on  metal-induced genotoxicity and suggest possible approaches for potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						Summary of Research:    <P>
To study the microgravity effect on cells, we developed a protocol for growing cells on microcarriers. We experimented different types of microcarrier beads, amount of microcarrier beads, cell type, seeding density of cells, types of environment to grow the cells on microcarriers (rocking or still), type of trypsin, trypsin time length, and type of rinse to produce the highest number of  metaphases (metaphase index) during a chromosome harvest. These optimization experiments were done for both human lung and skin fibroblast cells (WTHBF-6, and BJhTERT, respectively).  Once optimal growth and reagents were determined we were able to test growth of cells in simulated microgravity using the High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARV) culture vessel bioreactor system. Based on previous studies, a rotation speed of 23 rpm was chosen to allow the cells to be in suspension while avoiding excessive centrifugal force.    <P>
Quantify the effect of microgravity on Cr(VI)-induced genotoxicity    <P>
Once all of these parameters were established we were able to begin genotoxicity studies. We found that cells grown on microcarriers and rotated at 23 rpm had less damage than cells grown at normal gravity under normal culture conditions. These data contradicted our previous data showing an increase in chromosome damage when microgravity was simulated by parabolas in a plane. We found that this difference was not due to cells growing on microcarrier beads.     <P>
Because we saw more damage in flight, it occurred to us that we may not be properly modeling microgravity with a setting of 23 rpm. With the wide range of speed settings on the HARV culture vessel rotating base it is possible rotational speed may play a role in the chromosome damage results at 23 rpm in the previous experiments.  To test for this we conducted experiments at 8 rpm.  This speed is significantly slower than the 23 rpm speed used previously, but is still able to grow and maintain cells as demonstrated in previous studies (4-6).  According to Hammond, 2001, as the rotation approaches zero the spirals of the HARV culture vessels are so large that the particles make one nearly continuous wall impact (6).  At high rotation speeds, wall impacts increase again due to centrifugal forces (7).  We found that sodium chromate induces even less damage at lower speed, further contradicting our flight data.    <P>
We next considered that there could be an effect on Cr uptake.  Our flight data showed less Cr uptake in microgravity leading to more damage. Thus, in order to further explain the possible differences seen in the amount of damage in cells treated in microgravity versus normal gravity, we conducted chemical uptake experiments to determine if the difference in damage was due to a difference in chromium uptake under differing gravity conditions. We found that cells in microgravity take up less chromium than cells under normal gravity conditions in human lung cells. These data were consistent with our flight data. When the chromosome damage data are considered based on Cr uptake we found that the amount of chromium-induced chromosome damage remains higher in normal gravity, in contrast to our published data of the effects of flight.    <P>
We also conducted experiments in human skin cells and found similar results as those found in human lung cells.    <P>
We conducted studies considering another Cr(VI) compound, lead chromate. Lead chromate is an insoluble form of chromate and is administered as a particle in suspension in cell cultures. There was no difference in the cytotoxic effect of lead chromate under microgravity and normal gravity conditions.     <P>
We used the Western blot assay to consider specific proteins involved in DNA repair signaling.  We focused on two major DNA double stand break repair proteins, Mre11 and Ku80. We chose these two proteins because DNA double strand breaks are one of the most hazardous DNA damage to the cell. Misrepaired DNA double strand breaks could lead to cancer formation. Two major repair pathways, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are involved in the repair of this damage. Mre11 is a DNA damage sensor and facilitates HR. Ku 80 recognizes and binds broken DNA ends in NHEJ. Using western blot assays we found that Cr(VI) decreases Mre11 expression in cells under normal gravity and microgravity condition. The Mre 11 level in cells under microgravity condition is similar to the cells in normal gravity. Cr(VI) does not affect Ku80 protein expression in cells under normal gravity but slightly increased Ku80 in cells under microgravity condition. These data suggest that altered gravity does not significantly change cellular DNA double strand break response.       <P>
Quantify the effect of hypergravity on Cr(VI)-induced genotoxicity    <P>
In addition to working on the effects of microgravity we extended our investigation to consider the contribution of hypergravity using a centrifuge. We considered the effect of hypergravity on the cytotoxic effect of sodium chromate, a soluble form of chromium, in human lung cells. Hypergravity exacerbated the effect of sodium chromate-induced cytotoxicity at lower concentrations in lung cells; however, at the highest concentration there was no difference in effect. We also looked at these effects in human skin cells. In skin cells there was no difference in the effect of hypergravity on sodium chromate-induced cytotoxicity. We also considered the contribution of hypergravity on the genotoxic effects of sodium chromate treatment. Our data show that sodium chromate induces similar chromosome damage at low concentration but less damage at higher concentration.    <P>
Determine if altered gravity effects are conserved across cell types and species    <P>
We investigated altered gravity effects in other species, specifically in bowhead whale and medaka cells. For these cells, we focused on the effect of hypergravity. There was significant time spent in working out the correct parameters and conditions of performing the experiments. Hypergravity was simulated using a centrifuge; however, we found that the centrifuge could not generate the temperatures required for proper culture conditions of the cells. The solution to this problem was to run the experiments at room temperature which involved additional testing to ensure that these variables were not influential in the final results. Growth curves were performed in which cells were exposed to room temperature for periods of time equal to those needed for the experiments. We found that this did not affect the overall growth of the cells and thus proceeded with some simple experiments to begin our investigations. We found that the cytotoxic effect of hexavalent chromium is not exacerbated by hypergravity in bowhead whale lung cells at 10g, however when we tested these cells at 2g we found a much greater difference.     <P>
We also considered the effects of chromate in medaka cells. We found that, similar to human skin cells, hypergravity did not exacerbate the chromium-induced cytotoxic effect in medaka cells. We then considered the genotoxic effect of chromium in medaka cells exposed to hypergravity. There was less chromium-induced damage seen in the cells exposed to hypergravity than cells exposed to normal gravity.     <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The long-term objective of this research is to develop a model of the effects of microgravity on the cellular response to genotoxicity.  The effects of microgravity on genotoxic response is important because NASA astronauts and personnel in microgravity will be  exposed to significant genotoxic agents including chemicals (e.g. metals) and radiation and the potential for microgravity to exacerbate  the genotoxic outcome is poorly understood. The short term objective of this research is to initially focus on chromium (Cr) because it  is one of the only metals with a well-established DNA repair response to genotoxicity that is also a component of lunar soil. We will  investigate the central hypothesis that altered gravity potentiates metal ion- and particle-induced genotoxicity. We will test this  hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) Determine Altered Gravity Effects on Metal-induced DNA Damage Formation and Repair in  Human Cells and 2) Determine if Altered Gravity Effects Are Conserved Across Cell Types and Species. These data when combined  with our data generated by our studies of lunar dust in cells at normal gravity can be used to help determine appropriate exposure  limits to moon dust. Our data will also be the first to evaluate how altered gravity affects metal-induced DNA repair gene expression  and signal transduction as well as effects on metal-induced apoptosis. These data will also indicate which responses are general and  which are cell or species specific. Altogether, these data should provide important insight into the mechanisms of altered gravity on  metal-induced genotoxicity and suggest possible approaches for potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						We found that cells grown on microcarriers and rotated at 23 rpm had less damage than cells grown at normal gravity under normal culture conditions. With the wide range of speed settings on the HARV culture vessel rotating base it is possible rotational speed may play a role in the chromosome damage results at 23 rpm in the previous experiments.  To test for this we conducted experiments at 8 rpm results suggest that lower rotational speeds have a larger effect.    <P>
In order to further explain the possible differences seen in the amount of damage seen in cells treated in microgravity versus normal gravity, we conducted chemical uptake experiments to determine if the difference in damage was due to a difference in chromium uptake under differing gravity conditions. We found that cells in microgravity take up less chromium than cells under normal gravity conditions in human lung cells. When the chromosome damage results are corrected for chemical uptake we see that the amount of chromium-induced chromosome damage is similar. These data were consistent when tested under the different rotational speeds (8 rpm vs 23 rpm).    <P>
This year we also conducted experiments in human skin cells and found similar results as those found in human lung cells. We found that there is less damage in skin cells exposed to microgravity when also exposed to sodium chromate than in cells grown at normal gravity. Additionally, we conducted uptake experiments in the human skin cells. We found that like the human lung cells there is less intracellular chromium present in the cells under microgravity conditions. When the level of chromosome damage seen is compared based on intracellular chromium concentration, the amount of damage under both microgravity and normal gravity conditions is the same.    <P>
In addition to working on the effects of microgravity we extended our investigation this year to consider the contribution of hypergravity. We considered the effect of hypergravity on the cytotoxic effect of sodium chromate, a soluble form of chromium, in human lung cells. Hypergravity exacerbated the effect of sodium chromate-induced cytotoxicity at lower concentrations in lung cells, however, at the highest concentration there was no difference in effect. We also looked at these effects in human skin cells. In skin cells there was no difference in the effect of hypergravity on sodium chromate-induced cytotoxicity. We also considered the contribution of hypergravity on the genotoxic effects of sodium chromate treatment. These experiments are currently under analysis.    <P>
We began studies considering another hexavalent chromium compound, lead chromate. Lead chromate is an insoluble form of chromate and is administered as a particle in suspension in cell cultures. We were unsure of how these studies would work as the particles come into direct and continuous contact with cells in the normal gravity conditions but not in the microgravity conditions.  To address this we also treated cells attached to microcarriers under normal gravity conditions. The data suggest that there is no difference in the cytotoxic effect of lead chromate between the microgravity and normal gravity conditions, however, we did have high variability between the 2 experiments, likely due to the added component of the particle. Additional experiments will be done to address this issue and further resolve the data.    <P>
We have begun to investigate these effects in other species, specifically in bowhead whale and medaka cells. For these cells, we focused on the effect of hypergravity. We found that the cytotoxic effect of hexavalent chromium is not exacerbated by hypergravity in bowhead whale lung cells at 10g, however when we tested these cells at 2g we found a much greater difference.     <P>
We also considered the effects of chromate in medaka cells. We found that, similar to human skin cells, hypergravity did not exacerbate the chromium-induced cytotoxic effect in medaka cells. We then considered the genotoxic effect of chromium in medaka cells exposed to hypergravity. There was less chromium-induced damage seen in the cells exposed to hypergravity than cells exposed to normal gravity.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The long-term objective of this research is to develop a model of the effects of microgravity on the cellular response to genotoxicity.  The effects of microgravity on genotoxic response is important because NASA astronauts and personnel in microgravity will be  exposed to significant genotoxic agents including chemicals (e.g. metals) and radiation and the potential for microgravity to exacerbate  the genotoxic outcome is poorly understood. The short term objective of this research is to initially focus on chromium (Cr) because it  is one of the only metals with a well-established DNA repair response to genotoxicity that is also a component of lunar soil. We will  investigate the central hypothesis that altered gravity potentiates metal ion- and particle-induced genotoxicity. We will test this  hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) Determine Altered Gravity Effects on Metal-induced DNA Damage Formation and Repair in  Human Cells and 2) Determine if Altered Gravity Effects Are Conserved Across Cell Types and Species. These data when combined  with our data generated by our studies of lunar dust in cells at normal gravity can be used to help determine appropriate exposure  limits to moon dust. Our data will also be the first to evaluate how altered gravity affects metal-induced DNA repair gene expression  and signal transduction as well as effects on metal-induced apoptosis. These data will also indicate which responses are general and  which are cell or species specific. Altogether, these data should provide important insight into the mechanisms of altered gravity on  metal-induced genotoxicity and suggest possible approaches for potential countermeasures. <P></td>

						Aim 1:    <P>
Our goals for year 1 were as follows: 1) quantify the effect of hyper- and microgravity on metal-induced genotoxicity; 2) measure the effects of altered gravity on metal ion and particle uptake; 3) measure the effects of altered gravity on metal-induced apoptosis; and 4) begin to determine the impact of altered gravity on metal-induced DNA damage repair.    <P>
Initial progress in year one was delayed because extensive optimization experiments were required to determine several variables before proceeding with the proposed experiments. First a protocol for growing cells on microcarriers had to be developed. We experimented with type of microcarrier, amount of microcarriers, type of cell, seeding density of cells, type of environment to grow the cells and microcarriers (rocking or still), type of trypsin, trypsin time length, and type of rinse to produce the highest number of  metaphases per 1500 cells (mitotic index) during a chromosome harvest. These optimization experiments were done on both the human lung fibroblast cells (WHTBF-6) and the human lung epithelial cells.  Once optimal growth and reagents were determined we were able to test growth of cells in simulated microgravity using the High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARV) culture vessels. Based on previous studies (1-3), cells were rotated on the HARV culture vessels at 23 rpm to allow the cells to be in suspension while avoiding excessive centrifugal force.    <P>
Once all of these parameters were established we were able to begin genotoxicity studies. Three repeats were performed with the ideal parameters. We found that cells grown on microcarriers and rotated at 23 rpm had less damage than cells grown at normal gravity under normal culture conditions.     <P>
We then needed to confirm that the differences in effects were not due to the fact that cells may grow differently on microcarriers versus normal culture conditions. Experiments were then done in which cells were grown with or without microcarriers at normal gravity. We found there is no significant difference in the amount of chromosome damage seen in cells grown with or without microcarriers at normal gravity.    <P>
With the wide range of speed settings on the HARV culture vessel rotating base it is possible rotational speed may play a role in the chromosome damage results at 23 rpm in the previous experiments.  To test for this we conducted experiments at 8 rpm.  This speed is significantly slower than the 23 rpm speed used previously, but is able to grow and maintain cells as demonstrated in previous studies (4-6).  According to Hammond, 2001(6) as the rotation approaches zero the spirals of the HARV culture vessels are so large that the particles make one nearly continuous wall impact.  At high rotation speeds, wall impacts increase again due to centrifugal forces (7).  We have conducted two experiments at 8 rpm thus far, preliminary results suggest that lower rotational speeds have a larger effect.    <P>
DNA double strand breaks can be measured as a representation of genotoxicity on a finer scale. DNA double strand breaks can serve as an effective measure for other DNA lesions such as adducts, oxidative damage, crosslinks and single strand breaks because the repair of these other lesions can cause the production of DNA double strand breaks or the outcome of their formation may cause replication fork collapse leading to a DNA double strand break. Thus, measuring DNA double strand breaks will address the question of whether altered gravity affects DNA damage on a finer scale either directly as a break or indirectly as another type of lesion. We found that the microcarriers would create significant issues with the proposed comet assay experiments and thus moved to assessing DNA double strand breaks by using a method incorporating g-H2AX detection in flow cytometry. This method allows for immediate detection after exposure regardless of the phase of the cell cycle, while chromosome damage requires cycling cells.  In addition, flow cytometry provides valuable information on the effect of microgravity on the cell cycle. The first experiment we have performed thus far experienced issues with the microcarriers.  Microcarriers blocked the flow cytometry machine.  We are attempting to resolve this issue with the use of cell strainers designed to filter out the microcarriers.  Additional experiments are in process.    <P>
We have also attempted Western Blot assays using our published methods (8) to detect and analyze specific proteins.  In the Western Blot procedure cells are scraped rather than trypsinized, however this technique is not possible with cells that grow on microcarriers. In addition, as with the flow cytometry experiments, we are not sure if microcarriers will affect the Western Blot process.  This experiment is in progress    <P>
Aim 2:    <P>
We have begun to investigate these effects in other species, specifically in bowhead whale and medaka cells. For these cells, we focused on the effect of hypergravity. There was significant time spent in working out the correct parameters and conditions of performing the experiments. Hypergravity was simulated using a centrifuge; however we found that the centrifuge could not generate the temperatures required for proper culture conditions of the cells. The solution to this problem was to run the experiments at room temperature which involved additional testing to ensure that these variables were not influential in the final results. Growth curves were performed in which cells were exposed to room temperature for periods of time equal to those needed for the experiments. We found that this did not affect the overall growth of the cells and thus proceeded with some simple experiments to begin our investigations. We found that the cytotoxic effect of hexavalent chromium is not exacerbated by hypergravity in bowhead whale lung cells or in medaka cells.    <P>
In addition to trouble shooting the basic growth parameters and the correct centrifuge settings to simulate hypergravity, we had to make modifications to our standard protocol for the chromosome damage assay.  These experiments are currently being analyzed and the data are pending.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The long-term objective of this research is to develop a model of the effects of microgravity on the cellular response to genotoxicity.  The effects of microgravity on genotoxic response is important because NASA astronauts and personnel in microgravity will be  exposed to significant genotoxic agents including chemicals (e.g. metals) and radiation and the potential for microgravity to exacerbate  the genotoxic outcome is poorly understood. The short term objective of this research is to initially focus on chromium (Cr) because it  is one of the only metals with a well-established DNA repair response to genotoxicity that is also a component of lunar soil. We will  investigate the central hypothesis that altered gravity potentiates metal ion- and particle-induced genotoxicity. We will test this  hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) Determine Altered Gravity Effects on Metal-induced DNA Damage Formation and Repair in  Human Cells and 2) Determine if Altered Gravity Effects Are Conserved Across Cell Types and Species. These data when combined  with our data generated by our studies of lunar dust in cells at normal gravity can be used to help determine appropriate exposure  limits to moon dust. Our data will also be the first to evaluate how altered gravity affects metal-induced DNA repair gene expression  and signal transduction as well as effects on metal-induced apoptosis. These data will also indicate which responses are general and  which are cell or species specific. Altogether, these data should provide important insight into the mechanisms of altered gravity on  metal-induced genotoxicity and suggest possible approaches for potential countermeasures. <P></td>
