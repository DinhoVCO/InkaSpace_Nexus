Thus, we have been studying the protein-lipid interactions of a bacterial mechanosensor by using an in vivo screen (as described in detail in the proposal). We have found a “hot spot” near the second transmembrane domain, just proximal to a cytoplasmic cluster of charged amino acids. The data suggest that the residues just proximal to this cluster enter the lipid environment upon sensor stimulation. This finding may have implications for the functioning of other sensors: a cytoplasmic charge cluster is a common feature among many channels, including candidate mechanosensors. We speculate that the movement of this region into the membrane could be an underlying feature for the function of many mechanosensors.

Original summary:    <P>
At the foundation of the ability of organisms to detect gravity is the capacity to detect mechanical forces. It is, for humans, the sheering force on stereocilia of vestibular hair cells, and for plants, the sedimentation of amyloplasts within a root cell. One of the primary molecules underlying the ability to detect mechanical forces is the mechanosensitive channel. To date, the best characterized is MscL, a microbial MechanoSensitive Channel of Large conductance. MscL opens a large pore in response to membrane tension; several studies now suggest sensing membrane tension is common among many mechanosensitive channels from microbes to plants and animals. Hence, the interactions between mechanosensitive channels and the lipid-membrane environment are of tremendous interest. Manipulating these interactions should have functional consequences that yield important clues of how the channel normally interacts with lipid. We have generated and characterized a library of mutated MscL channels in which each residue in and around the transmembrane domains has been sequentially mutated to cysteine. Treatment of these mutants with sulfhydryl reagents containing aromatic rings or alkyl chains should encourage hydrophobic interactions or tether the residue to the membrane. If the modified residue is normally within a hydrophobic environment when in a specific state (closed, transition or open), then that state would be stabilized. We have developed an in vivo screen that allows us to rapidly assess functional changes in the MscL channel simply by monitoring bacterial growth; channels in which the open, closed or even various transition states have been stabilized are identified. Once manipulations that lead to functional consequences are selected, the exact functional changes of MscL will be assessed by electrophysiological assays. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. When completed, this study will yield critical insight into how mechanosensitive channels sense and respond to membrane tension.    <P>
  Progress:  Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels that directly transduce mechanical stimuli are thought to underlie diverse physiological functions such as the senses of touch, hearing, proprioception, gravity sensing, and osmoregulation. Although the molecular entities of most eukaryotic MS channels still remain elusive, their bacterial counterparts have been extensively studied and thus serve today as paradigms for MS channels. Hence, we use these channels to study the mechanisms of how mechanosensors sense and interact with their lipid environment. This study has allowed us to determine some of the dynamics of these interactions upon channel stimulation and opening.     <P>
	The mechanosensitive channels of large conductance, MscL, and of smaller conductance, MscS, are the two major MS channels in bacteria. They effect a coordinated response to hypo-osmotic shock, serving as emergency release valves for the rapid flux of fluid and solutes. MscL from E. coli was the first to be identified, and is perhaps the best studied mechanosensor from any species. A crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis MscL has been solved, revealing a pentameric structure in a nearly-closed pore of about 4 Å. An extremely large conformational change of this protein must occur to achieve the open pore size of 30 Å estimated by conductance (the amount of ions that pass through the pore in a unit of time) and by molecular sieving experiments. Several models of the gating of MscL have been proposed to explain the drastic structural rearrangements to transition from the closed to open states. Although the models differ in details, all agree that a thinning of the channel in the plane of the membrane, accompanied by the tilting of the transmembrane domains, are necessary to allow the pentamer to achieve an open pore structure. Both of these arrangements require dynamic interactions between regions of the protein and lipids.     <P>
	Since X-ray crystallography of integral membrane proteins typically provide little information on their interactions with the surrounding lipids, other techniques have been used to address this issue for MscL. Utilizing some of these approaches, the second transmembrane span (TM2) of E. coli MscL, which faces the lipid membrane, has been defined. Five amino acids after the predicted end of TM2 there is a cluster of charged residues (RKKEE), which appear to be important for channel function; one E. coli MscL study showed that a C-terminal deletion at this point leads to non-functional channels, while another suggested that it serves as a pH sensor by changing the conformation of the region, and it was also suggested to interact with anionic phospholipids. Interestingly, analogous structures with a series of charged amino acids distal to the cytoplasmic transmembrane helix has been noted in other MS channel families. Hence, this region, just cytoplasmic of TM2, is a prime candidate to be involved in the dynamic lipid-protein interactions that occur during MscL gating.    <P>
	The project was basically to utilize an in vivo screen approach to determine areas that may be dynamic within the membrane. Basically, we utilized a library of individual cysteine mutations throughout the protein. Cysteine is unique in that it is reactive to sulfhydryl reagents. Thus, you can post-translationally modify any residue. Here we used modifiers that made the region more hydrophobic, i.e. wanting to go into the membrane. The assumption is that certain regions will normally go into the membrane upon activation of sensor; by forcing this region into the membrane, we may artificially cause the channel to be activated. We know from several other experiments that if this occurs in a living cell, it causes the cell to be less viable or die. Therefore, we can use this as a screen. The modifying reagents we used are: DMTS, which adds a fatty acid chain and would be very aggressive in burying the region within the membrane; MTSBn, which adds what equates to a phenylalanine to the site; and 4-HB-MTS, which is the same as previous but contains a polar hydroxyl group, thus adding what equates to a tyrosine.    <P>
	In the prior years, we screened the available cysteine mutants, and generated additional cysteine mutants. In the last year, we finished the screening of the newly generated cysteine mutants, evaluated the data from the entire screen, and performed secondary screens on the “hits” that allow us to determine if the modifications lead to an overactive (gain-of-function; GOF) or dysfunctional (loss-of-function; LOF) sensor.     <P>
	In the past year we have acknowledged NASA funding in three publications, have two more in press, and have a manuscript in preparation. One of the in press manuscripts is a minireview in the Biophysical Journal entitled “Sensing and responding to membrane tension: the bacterial MscL channel as a model system”. NASA funding is acknowledged, and some of the data from this project figures prominently within the review.     <P>
	The data have provided a glimpse at how a mechanosensor dynamically interacts with the lipid membrane. Notably, the results of this project led to the finding that one residue appears to enter the lipid membrane in a piston-like manner upon sensor activation.    <P>

It is, for humans, the sheering force on stereocillia of vestibular hair cells, and for plants, the sedimentation of amyloplasts within a root cell. One of the primary molecules underlying the ability to detect mechanical forces is the mechanosensitive channel. To date, the best characterized is MscL, a microbial MechanoSensitive Channel of Large conductance. MscL opens a large pore in response to membrane tension; several studies now suggest sensing membrane tension is common among many mechanosensitive channels from microbes to plants and animals. Hence, the interactions between mechanosensitive channels and the lipid-membrane environment are of tremendous interest. Manipulating these interactions should have functional consequences that yield important clues of how the channel normally interacts with lipid. We have generated and characterized a library of mutated MscL channels in which each residue in and around the transmembrane domains has been sequentially mutated to cysteine. Treatment of these mutants with sulfhydryl reagents containing aromatic rings or alkyl chains should encourage hydrophobic interactions or tether the residue to the membrane. If the modified residue is normally within a hydrophobic environment primarily when in a specific state (closed, transition or open), then that state  would be stabilized. We have developed an in vivo screen that allows us to rapidly assess functional changes in the MscL channel simply by monitoring bacterial growth; channels in which the open, closed or even various transition states have been stabilized are identified. Once manipulations that lead to functional consequences are selected, the exact functional changes of MscL will be assessed by electrophysiological assays. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. When completed, this study will yield critical insight into how mechanosensitive channels sense and respond to membrane tension. <P></td>

						Progress:    <P>
Underlying any organism’s ability to sense and react to gravitational force are biological mechano-sensors. In plants it is the sedimentation of amyloplasts within the columella cells in the root cap that generates the mechanical force; in humans it is the sheering forces along the stereocillia of the hair cells within the vestibular system. Although the precise molecular sensor in each of these cases is not yet known, most scientists within these fields believe that the molecular sensors are mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. Recent studies have implied that many independent mechanosensors may have common molecular mechanisms, that of directly sensing their membrane environment.    <P>
The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL (for MechanoSensitive Channel of Large conductance) is the first cloned and, to date, best characterized MS channel; it has emerged as a paradigm for how MS channels sense and respond to mechanical forces. The MscL channel opens a large pore in the cell envelope, which is composed of a lipid membrane, in response to acute decreases in osmotic environment, thus serving as a “biological emergency release valve”. Early studies assumed that the protein sensed tension within the cell lipid membrane; we have recently demonstrated that indeed this is the case. A plethora of evidence has suggested that a number of other independent MS channels similarly sense membrane stretch and either open in response to this stimulus, or have their opening modulated by it. The list of channels that sense membrane tension includes members of the bacterial and plant MscS MS channel family, a mechanosensitive channel from the yeast S. cerevisiae, and within mammals, members off the two-pore domain potassium (K2P), transient receptor potential (TRP), epithelial sodium (ENaC), and BK channels. Members within this list may indeed be related to gravity sensors used by plants (MscS homologues are among the best candidates) and animals (TRP channels are prime candidates). Thus, it appears that for many mechanosensors, most likely including those involved with gravity sensing, the protein senses and responds to its lipid environment. Sensor protein-lipid interactions therefore are likely to be important in sensing gravity.     <P>
We hypothesized that modifying or exaggerating protein/lipid interactions would alter the normal response of a MS channel, and that these alterations would give insight into the fundamental principles of how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Toward this end, we proposed the single objective of potentially modifying such interactions at over 75 sites within the 136 amino acid MscL protein. Briefly, we have generated and characterized a library of mutated MscL channels in which each residue in and around the membrane has been sequentially mutated to the reactive residue cysteine; note that MscL contains no endogenous cysteines. Treatment of these mutants with reactive chemicals, known as sulfhydryl reagents, containing hydrophobic aromatic rings or alkyl chains will tether the residue to the membrane or other hydrophobic pockets. If the residue is normally within these environments in a specific state (closed, open or transition), then that state would be stabilized. To generate rapid assays, we have used the power of microbial screens – we let the bacteria tell us what areas of the channel are functionally important. We have already developed a series of in vivo screens that allow us to assess functional changes in the MscL channel simply by monitoring bacterial growth and survival; in a single screen we can detect channels in which either the open, closed, and even transition states have been stabilized. Once potential mutants and hydrophobic- or lipid-tethering manipulations have been identified in a screen, the precise functional consequences to the channel properties will be assessed by conventional, but more laborious, electrophysiological assay known as patch clamp.    <P>
Patch clamp allows scientists to measure the activities (opening and closing) of individual channels within a biological membrane; for the first time individual molecular events could be measured. It literally revolutionized the study of biological channels. Mechanosensitive (MS) channels that respond to membrane stretch were, for the first time, looked for and found in embryonic chick skeletal muscle in 1984. Since then, MS channels have been found in numerous cell types, and are likely to be the molecular sensors at the foundation of many senses including gravity sensing. In 1987 researchers generated giant bacterial cells and used patch clamp to assay channel activities within native E. coli membranes. What they found was an abundance of MS channels. We now know that there are at least two major families of MS channels within bacteria: MscL (for MechanoSensitive Channel of Large conductance) and MscS (Small conductance).    <P>
MscL remains the best characterized MS channel to date. Reconstitution experiments have demonstrated that MscL directly senses membrane tension, no other proteins are necessary for channel activity. Indeed, the channel appears to directly sense biophysical stresses within the lipid bilayer. Physiologically we know that MscL and MscS work in coordination as biological “emergency release valves” releasing excessive cell turgor (pressure within the cell) caused by acute decreases in osmotic environment, often referred to as osmotic downshock. Upon activation, a large pore is created that allows passage of molecules upwards of 30Å in diameter. Structural studies have solved a closed, or nearly closed, conformation of an MscL orthologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that reveals the complex as a homopentamer of subunits containing two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) connected by a periplasmic loop; the amino- and carboxyl-termini are predicted to be cytoplasmic. The N-terminal forms an amphipathic (one side hydrophobic or lipid loving, the other hydrophilic or water loving) ? helix and is often referred to as S1. This structure is now known to run along the cytoplasmic face of the membrane where it may serve as a lipid anchor; this structure is shared among many channels and further understanding the importance of its interaction with the membrane may have far-reaching implications.    <P>
We have thus far performed the screen of the current cysteine library with the three compounds discussed in the proposal: 4-HB-MTS, which adds a tyrosine-like residue; MTSBn, which adds a phenylalanine-like residue; and DMTS, which adds a decyl fatty acid chain to the location. The percentage change in cell viability of the in vivo screen has been assessed. We have thus far obtained one publication in one of the more obvious ‘hot spots’. We have asked for a no-cost-extension for the remaining funds so we can pursue the following:    <P>
•	We are investigating additional ‘hot spots’ within the protein by patch clamp    <P>
•	We have extended the cysteine library to be screened to include the periplasmic loop between the two transmembrane domains. We are in the process of screening and investigating this region.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> At the foundation of the ability of organisms to detect gravity is the capacity to detect mechanical forces. It is, for humans, the sheering force on stereocillia of vestibular hair cells, and for plants, the sedimentation of amyloplasts within a root cell. One of the primary molecules underlying the ability to detect mechanical forces is the mechanosensitive channel. To date, the best characterized is MscL, a microbial MechanoSensitive Channel of Large conductance. MscL opens a large pore in response to membrane tension; several studies now suggest sensing membrane tension is common among many mechanosensitive channels from microbes to plants and animals. Hence, the interactions between mechanosensitive channels and the lipid-membrane environment are of tremendous interest. Manipulating these interactions should have functional consequences that yield important clues of how the channel normally interacts with lipid. We have generated and characterized a library of mutated MscL channels in which each residue in and around the transmembrane domains has been sequentially mutated to cysteine. Treatment of these mutants with sulfhydryl reagents containing aromatic rings or alkyl chains should encourage hydrophobic interactions or tether the residue to the membrane. If the modified residue is normally within a hydrophobic environment primarily when in a specific state (closed, transition or open), then that state  would be stabilized. We have developed an in vivo screen that allows us to rapidly assess functional changes in the MscL channel simply by monitoring bacterial growth; channels in which the open, closed or even various transition states have been stabilized are identified. Once manipulations that lead to functional consequences are selected, the exact functional changes of MscL will be assessed by electrophysiological assays. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. When completed, this study will yield critical insight into how mechanosensitive channels sense and respond to membrane tension. <P></td>

						Underlying any organism’s ability to sense and react to gravitational force are biological mechano-sensors. In plants it is the sedimentation of amyloplasts within the columella cells in the root cap that generates the mechanical force; in humans it is the sheering forces along the stereocillia of the hair cells within the vestibular system. Although the precise molecular sensor in each of these cases is not yet known, most scientists within these fields believe that the molecular sensors are mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. Recent studies have implied that many independent mechanosensors may have common molecular mechanisms, that of directly sensing their membrane environment.    <P>
The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL (for MechanoSensitive Channel of Large conductance) is the first cloned and, to date, best characterized MS channel; it has emerged as a paradigm for how MS channels sense and respond to mechanical forces. The MscL channel opens a large pore in the cell envelope, which is composed of a lipid membrane, in response to acute decreases in osmotic environment, thus serving as a “biological emergency release valve”. Early studies assumed that the protein sensed tension within the cell lipid membrane; we have recently demonstrated that indeed this is the case. A plethora of evidence has suggested that a number of other independent MS channels similarly sense membrane stretch and either open in response to this stimulus, or have their opening modulated by it. The list of channels that sense membrane tension includes members of the bacterial and plant MscS MS channel family, a mechanosensitive channel from the yeast S. cerivicea, and within mammals, members off the two-pore domain potassium (K2P), transient receptor potential (TRP), epithelial sodium (ENaC), and BK channels. Members within this list may indeed be related to gravity sensors used by plants (MscS homologues are among the best candidates) and animals (TRP channels are prime candidates). Thus, it appears that for many mechanosensors, most likely including those involved with gravity sensing, the protein senses and responds to its lipid environment. Sensor protein-lipid interactions therefore are likely to be important in sensing gravity.     <P>
We hypothesized that modifying or exaggerating protein/lipid interactions would alter the normal response of a MS channel, and that these alterations would give insight into the fundamental principles of how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Toward this end, we proposed the single objective of potentially modifying such interactions at over 75 sites within the 136 amino acid MscL protein. Briefly, we have generated and characterized a library of mutated MscL channels in which each residue in and around the membrane has been sequentially mutated to the reactive residue cysteine; note that MscL contains no endogenous cysteines. Treatment of these mutants with reactive chemicals, known as sulfhydryl reagents, containing hydrophobic aromatic rings or alkyl chains will tether the residue to the membrane or other hydrophobic pockets. If the residue is normally within these environments in a specific state (closed, open or transition), then that state would be stabilized. To generate rapid assays, we have used the power of microbial screens – we let the bacteria tell us what areas of the channel are functionally important. We have already developed a series of in vivo screens that allow us to assess functional changes in the MscL channel simply by monitoring bacterial growth and survival; in a single screen we can detect channels in which either the open, closed, and even transition states have been stabilized. Once potential mutants and hydrophobic- or lipid-tethering manipulations have been identified in a screen, the precise functional consequences to the channel properties will be assessed by conventional, but more laborious, electrophysiological assay known as patch clamp.    <P>
Patch clamp allows scientists to measure the activities (opening and closing) of individual channels within a biological membrane; for the first time individual molecular events could be measured. It literally revolutionized the study of biological channels. Mechanosensitive (MS) channels that respond to membrane stretch were, for the first time, looked for and found in embryonic chick skeletal muscle in 1984. Since then, MS channels have been found in numerous cell types, and are likely to be the molecular sensors at the foundation of many senses including gravity sensing. In 1987 researchers generated giant bacterial cells and used patch clamp to assay channel activities within native E. coli membranes. What they found was an abundance of MS channels. We now know that there are at least two major families of MS channels within bacteria: MscL (for MechanoSensitive Channel of Large conductance) and MscS (Small conductance).    <P>
MscL remains the best characterized MS channel to date. Reconstitution experiments have demonstrated that MscL directly senses membrane tension, no other proteins are necessary for channel activity. Indeed, the channel appears to directly sense biophysical stresses within the lipid bilayer. Physiologically we know that MscL and MscS work in coordination as biological “emergency release valves” releasing excessive cell turgor (pressure within the cell) caused by acute decreases in osmotic environment, often referred to as osmotic downshock. Upon activation, a large pore is created that allows passage of molecules upwards of 30Å in diameter. Structural studies have solved a closed, or nearly closed, conformation of an MscL orthologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis that reveals the complex as a homopentamer of subunits containing two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) connected by a periplasmic loop; the amino- and carboxyl-termini are predicted to be cytoplasmic. The N-terminal forms an amphipathic (one side hydrophobic or lipid loving, the other hydrophilic or water loving) alpha-helix and is often referred to as S1. This structure is now known to run along the cytoplasmic face of the membrane where it may serve as a lipid anchor; this structure is shared among many channels and further understanding the importance of its interaction with the membrane may have far-reaching implications.    <P>
We have thus far performed the screen of the current cysteine library with the three compounds discussed in the proposal: 4-HB-MTS, which adds a tyrosine-like residue; MTSBn, which adds a phenylalanine-like residue; and DMTS, which adds a decyl fatty acid chain to the location. The percentage change in cell viability of the in vivo screen has been assessed. We have found a “hot spot” at the cytoplasmic end of the second transmembrane domain (TM2, from amino acid 103 to 108). We have performed secondary screens on these mutants, and have begun obtaining electrophysiological data from the resulting channels by patch clamp. Interestingly, these data suggest that N103C yields a gain-of-function phenotype (oens more easily) when treated with MTSBn and DMTS, but loss of function (does not open to a normal stimulus) when treated with 4-HB-MTS; a simple hydroxyl group, which would make the site only slightly more hydrophilic, reverses the phenotype. We believe this indicates that this residue normally enters the membrane upon channel opening.    <P>
We are currently pursuing the following:    <P>
•	More fully examining the N103 to E108 mutations. As stated above, the secondary screens and preliminary patch clamp data suggest that N103 may move into the membrane upon channel opening. We are attempting to support this hypothesis by site-directed mutagenesis, and, if possible, biochemical means.    <P>
•	Expanding the cysteine library. The finding that M42 showed some phenotype in our screen suggests that other residues in the periplasm (just outside the cell) may yield interesting results. Hence, we are generating additional mutations in this region of the protein.    <P>
•	Investigating the other positives (that show a change in phenotype) yielded by the screens. We may put at higher priority the periplasmic half of the first transmembrane domain (TM1; from G30 to S35) because this region is also at the lipid/aqueous interface.   <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> At the foundation of the ability of organisms to detect gravity is the capacity to detect mechanical forces. It is, for humans, the sheering force on stereocillia of vestibular hair cells, and for plants, the sedimentation of amyloplasts within a root cell. One of the primary molecules underlying the ability to detect mechanical forces is the mechanosensitive channel. To date, the best characterized is MscL, a microbial MechanoSensitive Channel of Large conductance. MscL opens a large pore in response to membrane tension; several studies now suggest sensing membrane tension is common among many mechanosensitive channels from microbes to plants and animals. Hence, the interactions between mechanosensitive channels and the lipid-membrane environment are of tremendous interest. Manipulating these interactions should have functional consequences that yield important clues of how the channel normally interacts with lipid. We have generated and characterized a library of mutated MscL channels in which each residue in and around the transmembrane domains has been sequentially mutated to cysteine. Treatment of these mutants with sulfhydryl reagents containing aromatic rings or alkyl chains should encourage hydrophobic interactions or tether the residue to the membrane. If the modified residue is normally within a hydrophobic environment primarily when in a specific state (closed, transition or open), then that state  would be stabilized. We have developed an in vivo screen that allows us to rapidly assess functional changes in the MscL channel simply by monitoring bacterial growth; channels in which the open, closed or even various transition states have been stabilized are identified. Once manipulations that lead to functional consequences are selected, the exact functional changes of MscL will be assessed by electrophysiological assays. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. When completed, this study will yield critical insight into how mechanosensitive channels sense and respond to membrane tension. <P></td>
