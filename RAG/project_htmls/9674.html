                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.     <P>
Plants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development, and reduces yield.     <P>
In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).     <P>
In all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast (8-10) and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.    <P>
We believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.    <P>
We also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.    <P>
We also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.    <P>
In conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.    <P>

						We are concluding our work through study of a large data set produced by analysis of an expanded group of Arabidopsis mutants that have been flown to the International Space Station (ISS) in the Biological Research in Canisters-22 (BRIC-22) experiment. These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to a variety of plant cellular stress responses. We successfully completed both of the preflight tests (science verification test (SVT) and experiment verification test (EVT)) to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the plant samples returned from BRIC-22. On August 14, 2017 our experiment was launched on board the SpaceX-12 ISS resupply mission and was successfully executed by ISS astronauts. The samples were preserved on orbit and underwent atmospheric reentry on board the same Dragon capsule in September of 2017. At the same time a duplicate of the experiment was grown at the Kennedy Space Center using temperature conditions which were matched to the flight conditions. We extracted RNA from both sets of samples and performed RNA sequencing in order to better understand what genes would be turned on and off specifically by spaceflight conditions in wild type plants and our mutant plants. We observed changes in the way that thousands of genes were activated in response to these conditions between flight and ground conditions and are submitting our results for peer review.     <P>
Meanwhile, further research on these stress regulating genes and the Arabidopsis mutants that were tested in BRIC-22 is also being completed in continuing ground-based studies. Through a better understanding of these gene’s function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.     <P>
Plants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development, and reduces yield.     <P>
In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).     <P>
In all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast (8-10) and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.    <P>
We believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.    <P>
We also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.    <P>
We also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.    <P>
In conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.    <P>

						Our project focuses on understanding plants’ responses to space stress to improve their performance in spaceflight. We focus on proteotoxic stress responses – collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). In our previous BRIC-18-2 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiment, we established differential gene regulation in wild type but also in an Arabidopsis UPR mutant. These findings pave the ground to our current experiment and to new areas of research on plant management of the different stresses that are found in space. We are expanding upon our original findings through exploration of a larger set of Arabidopsis UPR mutants that have been flown to the International Space Station (ISS) in a BRIC-22 experiment. These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to stresses observed previously, but have different molecular functions. We successfully completed both of the preflight tests (science verification test (SVT) and experiment verification test (EVT)) to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the samples returned from BRIC-22.     <P>
On August 14, 2017 our experiment was launched on board the SpaceX-12 ISS resupply mission and was successfully executed by ISS astronauts. The samples were preserved on orbit and underwent atmospheric reentry on board the same Dragon capsule in September of 2017. These were then returned to the Brandizzi lab still preserved at -80 degrees C. The samples were processed yielding experimental material that was determined to be in excellent condition. The RNA extracted from these plants has recently completed  the high throughput sequencing process. A large data set comprising a total of 1.45 billion reads (yield of 72.77 Giga base pairs) and an average of approximately 32 million reads per sample was acquired. More than 95% of all raw reads were successfully mapped to the Arabidopsis genome for each sample. We identified differentially expressed genes using a standard bioinformatics pipeline. For each genotype, differentially expressed genes in flight samples relative to ground samples were determined using a strict criteria (adjusted P value <0.01; 0.5 > Fold Change >2). In total, more than 4,000 differentially expressed genes were found to be up or down regulated in at least one of the tested genotypes. In wild type plants more than 3000 genes (>2 fold change) were upregulated under spaceflight conditions. Additionally, we found that around 300 genes were downregulated (>0.5 fold) in wild type plants in flight samples compared to ground. To help dissect the biological implications of this large data set, we have thus far established a baseline understanding of what known biological processes were represented by the transcripts altered in the wild type background in response to space flight. To do so we utilized PANTHER Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis (PANTHER, Overrepresentation Test, Fisher’s Exact test type with False Discovery Rate calculation; corrected p-value <0.05). In wild type, over 100 GO terms were either significantly enriched or surprisingly underrepresented in the 3000 upregulated differentially expressed genes. Furthermore ~50 GO terms were significantly enriched in the downregulated differentially expressed genes. We are currently extending this analysis to better understand how UPR regulators contribute these observations by comparing patterns of gene regulation in UPR mutant lines to our findings in wild type.     <P>
Additionally, further research on the genes missing from the Arabidopsis mutants to be tested in BRIC-22 is also being completed in ground based studies. Through a better understanding of gene function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.     <P>
Plants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development, and reduces yield.     <P>
In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).     <P>
In all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast8-10 and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.    <P>
We believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.    <P>
We also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.    <P>
We also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.    <P>
In conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.    <P>

						In the previous BRIC-18-2 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiment, we have established differential gene regulation in wild type but also in mutant Arabidopsis with defects in pro-survival management strategies. These findings open new areas of research on plant management of the different stresses that are found in space.    <P>
We are currently expanding upon this work through exploration of a larger set of Arabidopsis mutants that have been flown to the International Space Station (ISS) in the BRIC-22 experiment. These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to stresses observed previously, but have different molecular functions. We successfully completed both of the preflight tests (Science and Experiment Verification Tests--SVT and EVT) to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the samples returned from BRIC-22.     <P>
On August 14, 2017 our experiment was launched on board the SpaceX-12 ISS resupply mission and was successfully executed by ISS astronauts. The samples were preserved on orbit and underwent atmospheric reentry on board the same Dragon capsule in September of 2017. These were then returned to the Brandizzi lab still preserved at -80 degrees C and the samples were processed yielding experimental material that was determined to be in excellent condition. The RNA extracted from these plants is currently undergoing high-throughput sequencing, which will enable us to examine the types of molecular responses activated by plants under spaceflight associated stress, in WT (wild type) and in mutant lines to determine how the mutated genes participate in maintaining the health of the plant under these conditions. We expect to receive the raw sequences from the sequencing facility at Michigan State University (MSU) in two weeks.    <P>
Additionally, further research on the genes missing from the Arabidopsis mutants to be tested in BRIC-22 is also being completed in ground-based studies. Through a better understanding of gene function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress, and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.     <P>
Plants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development and reduces yield.     <P>
In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).     <P>
In all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast8-10 and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.    <P>
We believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.    <P>
We also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.    <P>
We also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.    <P>
In conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.    <P>

						In the previous BRIC-18-2 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiment, we have established differential gene regulation in wild type but also in mutant Arabidopsis with defects in pro-survival management strategies. These findings open new areas of research on plant management of the different stresses that are found in space.     <P>
Furthermore, we are expanding upon this work through exploration of a larger set of Arabidopsis mutants that will be flown to the International Space Station in the BRIC-22 experiment. These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to stresses observed previously, but have different molecular functions. To date we have completed both of the preflight tests to validate the exact experimental protocols necessary to prepare and analyze the samples returned from BRIC-22.  Our research team successfully performed the Science and Experiment Verification Test (S-EVT) at the Kennedy Space Center Test and Operations Support Contract Center (KSC-TOSC). After flight simulations, and preservation of the samples which mimic conditions during actual launch, KSC-TOSC members performed the deintegration, and frozen samples were shipped to Michigan State University for analysis. Samples were thawed and RNA was extracted for quality control purposes, which was found to be in excellent conditions.     <P>
We are currently preparing for our final launch integration by producing new seeds from each of the various genetic backgrounds to ensure availability of fresh material for this experiment. Further research on the genes missing from the Arabidopsis mutants to be tested in BRIC-22 is being completed in ground based studies.  Through a better understanding of gene function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines resistant to these stresses. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> The molecular study of human health conditions that develop in response to long term habitation in spaceflight conditions is inherently limited by the necessity to insure safety of study participants. As such, the cellular and molecular pathology of these disease states and potential remediations are unknown.  Comparative biology, or the study of similar situations in different types of organisms, presents a unique opportunity to explore these human conditions with minimal associated risks. The study of conserved cellular stress responsive pathways between humans and plants provides this benefit and many others. In particular, plants are the primary production source for metabolic energy and oxygen in our terrestrial environment, and proper application in extraterrestrial and spaceflight conditions could potentially reduce the cost of recreating human habitable environments in extremely harsh conditions.     <P>
Plants, like animals, suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, are known to generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2).  The ER, a conserved structure in human and plant cells, initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5). In spaceflight conditions a number of factors including microgravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients) reduces overall plant growth, impairs development and reduces yield.     <P>
In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5).     <P>
In all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast8-10 and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.    <P>
We believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.    <P>
We also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.    <P>
We also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.    <P>
In conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.    <P>

						In the previous BRIC-18-2 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiment, we have established differential gene regulation in wild type but also in mutant Arabidopsis with defects in pro-survival management strategies. These findings open new areas of research on plant management of the different stresses that are found in space; a manuscript regarding these findings is currently in preparation.     <P>
Furthermore, we are expanding upon this work through exploration of a larger set of Arabidopsis mutants that will be flown to the International Space Station in the BRIC-22 experiment. These mutants are missing genes that are critical in regulating the response to stresses observed previously, but have different molecular functions. At this stage in the experiment we have completed stage one of preflight testing used to validate the exact experimental protocols to prepare and analyze the samples returned from BRIC-22.   Our research team successfully performed the Science and Verification Test (SVT) at the Kennedy Space Center Test and Operations Support Contract Center (KSC-TOSC). After flight simulations, and preservation of the samples which mimic conditions during actual launch, KSC-TOSC members performed the deintegrated and frozen samples were shipped to Michigan State University for analysis. Samples were thawed and RNA was extracted for quality control purposes, which was found to be in excellent condition.     <P>
We are currently preparing for the second set of preflight tests and producing new seeds from each of the different types of Arabidopsis plants to ensure that we have the freshest material available for this experiment. Further research on the genes missing from the Arabidopsis mutants to be tested in BRIC-22 is being completed in ground based studies.  Through a better understanding of gene function at a cellular and organism level in terrestrial growth conditions, we will be better positioned to explore what role these genes have in spaceflight conditions. This information will be adapted to help produce Arabidopsis lines which could be resistant to these stresses. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development, and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to spaceflight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Plants are the primary source of energy and oxygen for all biospheric development. Thus, plants are essential to the establishment of large-scale controlled ecosystems on terrestrial and extraterrestrial surfaces. Similar to animals, plants suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such changes in temperature, reduced nutrients, and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, can generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2). The ER is the organelle that initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5).     <P>
In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5). Based on the key role of the Arabidopsis IRE1 (AtIRE1) in stress responses, our work aims to identify the genes that are under the transcriptional control of AtIRE1 in plants during growth as well as under stress due to enhanced secretory protein accumulation.     <P>
In all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast8-10 and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.    <P>
We believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.     <P>
We also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.     <P>
We also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.    <P>
In conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness, it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.     <P>

						Through the BRIC-18-2 (Biological Research in Canisters) experiments, we were able to fly wild type and a UPR mutant to the International Space Station (ISS), and carry out comparative transcriptomics analyses ISS-seedlings exposed to space conditions for 7 and 14 days. Seedlings of identical genotypes were also grown on ground, as control. The experiment consisted of two biological replicates, except for 14-day-old wild type that was based on only 1 biological replicate to make space for HOBO temperature data logger. Seeds were kept in dormant state through cold stowage. Upon docking of the SpaceX-3 Dragon capsule at the ISS, the experiment proceeded in the BRIC-18-2 at room temperature, which allowed seed germination. On-orbit canisters containing the seedlings were actuated by RNALater injection after 7 and 14 days, respectively from docking. This procedure was followed by a three-hour storage at room temperature, and then the canisters were stored at +4°C prior to longer term storage in the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer until de-integration from the BRIC hardware and subsequent turnover to our team.     <P>
SpaceX-3 Dragon containing our experiment launched on 4/18/14 and the experiment returned on ground 05/17/2014. In parallel, the experiment was replicated on ground at the Kennedy Space Center Test and Operations Support Contract Center (KSC-TOSC) in the International Space Station Environment Simulator (ISSES) Chamber.    <P>
All flight and ground samples were returned to us without contamination and we observed germination rates of at least 90%. Etiolated hypocotyl growth looked great. Both flight and ground control RNA samples were inspected for RNA quality and sequenced through customary approaches. Transcript reads were aligned to matching locations in the reference genome using dedicated software and transcript abundance was also estimated. The results that we obtained are statistically significant because of the number of technical replicates. We are now confirming the expression of some marker genes by quantitative RT-PCR to add robustness to our data for publication.     <P>
Our experiments to date have enabled us to establish differential gene regulation in wild type but also in mutant Arabidopsis with defects in pro-survival management strategies. These findings open new areas of research on plant strategies on stress management in space. We are now confirming transcriptomics results for specific genes to validate the RNASeq analyses and submit the results for publication. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to space flight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Plants are the primary source of energy and oxygen for all biospheric development. Thus, plants are essential to the establishment of large-scale controlled ecosystems on terrestrial and extraterrestrial surfaces. Similar to animals, plants suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such changes in temperature, reduced nutrients and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, can generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2). The ER is the organelle that initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5).     <P>
In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5). Based on the key role of the Arabidopsis IRE1 (AtIRE1) in stress responses, our work aims to identify the genes that are under the transcriptional control of AtIRE1 in plants during growth as well as under stress due to enhanced secretory protein accumulation.     <P>
In all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast8-10 and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.    <P>
We believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.     <P>
We also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.     <P>
We also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.    <P>
In conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness; it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.     <P>

						This year has been most satisfactory. We have set up the science requirements with the NASA HQ crew and successfully integrated and orbited our science in the BRIC-18 canister upon successfully meeting the Flight Readiness Review. This has been achieved upon establishing and revising the flight requirements for the success of our experiment. Specifically, we have been working with the Kennedy Space Center crew to develop proper payload and in-flight procedures. We have successfully passed the required Payload Verification Tests (PVT) as required. After multiple delays related to SpaceX3/NASA, which were independent from our science and lab, our science has launched in Falcon-9 on Friday 18 April 2014 and docked onto the ISS on Sunday April 20 2014. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to space flight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Plants are the primary source of energy and oxygen for all biospheric development. Thus, plants are essential to the establishment of large-scale controlled ecosystems on terrestrial and extraterrestrial surfaces.   Similar to animals, plants suffer from stress linked to a variety of challenges. For example, certain adverse environmental conditions, such changes in temperature, reduced nutrients and disease, as well as physiological situations, such as growth, can generate an imbalance between demand and capacity of protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition that is also known as ER stress (1, 2). The ER is the organelle that initiates the production of all secretory proteins. Secretory proteins constitute one third of the cellular proteome and allow cells to communicate with the external environment. The ER can sense stress due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, and restores homeostasis by invoking a largely conserved cytoprotective signaling pathway, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compromised UPR leads to serious conditions and even death in animals and plants (3-5).     <P>
In animals and plants, several sensors and transducers initiate the UPR; however, IRE1, an ER-associated protein kinase and ribonuclease, functions as a major ER stress sensor and plays a key role in the UPR signaling by controlling UPR gene expression (4, 6, 7). Activities in our lab and others have demonstrated that plant IRE1 is needed to respond to a diversified portfolio of stimuli linked to abiotic and biotic stress and cell growth and differentiation, as well as to modulate responsive outputs (4, 5). Based on the key role of the Arabidopsis IRE1 (AtIRE1) in stress responses, our work aims to identify the genes that are under the transcriptional control of AtIRE1 in plants during growth as well as under stress due to enhanced secretory protein accumulation.     <P>
In all eukaryotes, IRE1 activates the UPR by an unconventional splicing of a bZIP transcription factor, namely Hac1 in yeast8-10 and Xbp1 in metazoans (11, 12). Recent efforts in our lab and others have shown that in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the functional equivalent of Hac1 and Xbp1 is bZIP60 (5, 13, 14). The bZIP60 mRNA splicing is followed by the synthesis of the mature form of bZIP60, which can modulate transcription of UPR genes in the nucleus. Thus, synthesis of the transcriptionally active bZIP60 occurs only in conditions of stress. In our research we will adopt the stress-dependent activation of bZIP60 to generate plants that can function as real-time stress bioreporters that can be easily used to report on the onset of stress in plants.    <P>
We believe that we will learn the mechanisms that enable plants to respond to ER stress. This is highly significant for the understanding of basic defense mechanisms in plants, and for engineering plants that can cope with stress on Earth.     <P>
We also expect that our research will have an important impact in biology with implications well beyond plants. Because the signaling pathways between plant and mammalian UPR are largely conserved, it is likely that understanding the UPR in a tractable multicellular model system, such as Arabidopsis, will allow building approaches with a strong potential to contribute to the solution of the problems in humans confronting cellular stress.     <P>
We also expect that we will be able to develop transplantable bioindicators of stress without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. These reporters will potentially facilitate the optimization of plant cultivation in hostile environments, such as marginal lands. In addition, because of the conservation of UPR mechanisms in plants and humans, real-time stress bioindicators will likely reflect the perception of stress in other organisms besides plants and thus they may be useful to develop practices to improve quality of life for humans.    <P>
In conclusion, not only will our research improve our nation's scientific competitiveness; it will also benefit education and the quality of life on Earth. Life on Earth depends on plants. With sharply growing environmental concerns (global warming, pollution, necessity to expand agriculture to marginal lands, etc.), understanding how plants can resist stress in hostile environments and adopting bioindicators help research to expand agriculture practices and thus ensure continued survival of the ever-growing human population.     <P>

						The long-term goal of this research is to determine the cellular and organismal mechanisms that control plant growth and development in space. The short-term goal of this proposal is to discover and examine the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to ER stress during growth and in conditions of induced stress as well as to design real-time bioindicators of stress. Based on the demonstrated crucial role of AtIRE1 in ER stress responses and on our data supporting that gravity stress activate the AtIRE1-dependent UPR, we hypothesize that AtIRE1 regulates plant ER stress response, not only in ground situations, but also in altered gravity conditions. Our results also argue that AtIRE1 controls qualitatively different responses to specific stress cues. Despite its crucial regulatory role, however, the downstream genes controlled by AtIRE1 are largely unknown. We also do not know how AtIRE1 modulates qualitatively different responses. Therefore the aims of this aware are:    <P>
2.2.1. Aim 1: Identify the genes controlled by AtIRE1 in specific stress conditions.   Our data support that growth, ER stress,and gravity changes affect cell homeostasis by activating the UPR through mechanisms controlled by AtIRE1. To better understand how cells respond to stress our goal is to define the genes that are under the control of AtIRE1 under physiological growth and in conditions of specific stress. To do so, we aim to carry out comprehensive transcriptomics analyses of a viable AtIRE1 loss-of-function mutant isolated in our lab, which cannot efficiently evoke the UPR2. We will compare the transcriptome of the mutant with wild type grown on ground, in conditions of hypergravity and in orbit, as well as in the presence of chemical ER-stress inducers. These activities will lead to the discovery of AtIRE1-regulated genes mediating growth as well as responses to specific stress conditions, and ultimately, to the design of plants with im-proved stress resistance traits, both on Earth and in space.    <P>
2.2.2. Aim 2: Develop real-time space stress indicators for detection of stress cues.   In stress conditions, AtIRE1 mediates the splicing of the bZIP60 mRNA. We aim to take advantage of this stress-specific bZIP60 activation to develop bioindicators of stress. Specifically, we aim to generate transgenic plants that can function as real-time stress bioindicators by engineering a bZIP60 protein fusion with a fluorescent reporter. The fluorescent reporter will be translated only upon the splicing of the bZIP60 mRNA in stress and can be easily revealed with instrumentation available in flight. We expect that our efforts will lead to the production of bioindicators that can provide facile, prompt and quantifiable stress readouts. Our research will develop indicators of plant stress on Earth and in orbit. Because of the conservation of the UPR, ultimately, this it will also help define which space situations can induce stress on other organisms, including humans, with obvious implications in research on flight safety, space environment design, and management.    <P>
Summary of progress for Aim 1:   To learn how the changes associated with altered gravity and flight affect plants and how plants respond to such changes, we have worked with the NASA personnel at the Kennedy Space Center to optimize growth conditions of wild-type Arabidopsis and an AtIRE1 loss of function mutant in flight-compatible equipment. We have also established the quantity and quality of plant material for optimal RNA extraction for RNA Seq experiments in such conditions.     <P>
Summary of progress for Aim 2:   We have generated the constructs for expression of fluorescent protein fusion to bZIP60 and engineered in a bZIP60 loss-of-function mutant to complement such line and observed the expression of the reporter during the onset of stress. These plants have been used at the Kennedy Space Center to establish the optimal conditions of growth and fixation for protein recovery during flight. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Successful plant growth in closed-loop life support conditions is a difficult challenge for the realization of long-term habitation of spacecraft and other extraterrestrial environments. In such environments, plants can undergo stress induced by a number of factors including changes in gravity, radiations, vibration, limited exchange of gases, and suboptimal growth conditions (temperature, light, nutrients). These sources of stress are often associated with reprogramming of gene expression and can cause limited plant growth, development and yield. To facilitate plant life in space, it is crucial to acquire a better understanding of the genetic changes that enable plant cells to respond to spaceflight stress. To do so, one goal of this proposal is to define the underlying mechanisms of plant adaptation to spaceflight environment at a transcriptional level. Through research supported by NASA, we have successfully identified a protein named AtIRE1 as a master regulator of transcription in conditions of stress responses to abiotic, biotic stress and to gravity changes in plants. However, the downstream signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 are not well defined, especially in conditions of altered gravity. A better understanding of the signaling pathways controlled by AtIRE1 is important to understand how plants can grow in conditions of stress. We propose to use in-flight and ground resources along with genomics and transcriptomics analyses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to understand the regulatory role of AtIRE1 in adaptation to space flight stress. Development of our research will continue to contribute to the understanding of basic signaling pathways that are in place to ensure stress survival in hostile environments, thus making possible the design and growth of plants that are resistant to space stress. To contribute further to the successful realization of habitation in space, we also aim to develop plants that can function as bioindicators of stress during in-flight situations. To do so, we will engineer plants with an AtIre1 substrate that is activated specifically in conditions of stress and that we will adapt to function as a visual stress reporter. The availability of real-time stress bioindicators will provide scientists and astronauts with direct read-outs of stress in the space environment. The results gathered in our research will contribute to NASA's strategic plans for the realization of long-term habitation of space and planetary surfaces. Because of the conservation of stress sensing and response mechanisms across multicellular organisms, we expect that our results will also have important implications for the general knowledge of stress and in the design of solutions for space stress management in multicellular organisms, including humans. <P></td>
