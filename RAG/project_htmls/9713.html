                    <td colspan="3"> The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs of the spine are important, weight-bearing tissues that are adapted to gravitational stress. The absence of gravitational axial loads on the body during exposure to microgravity may disrupt normal spine physiology and function. During microgravity exposure, deconditioning of the intervertebral discs and spinal tissues poses a serious risk upon re-exposure to 1-G and exercise. Our recent data in identical twins exposed to 30-days bed rest indicate that compressibility increases in the lumbar spine and its intervertebral discs during 30-days simulated microgravity. Because intervertebral discs become more collapsible during simulated microgravity, the probability of disc prolapse or herniation upon re-exposure to gravity increases.    <P>
We hypothesize that nucleus pulposus swelling pressures in mouse spines will significantly decrease following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. In addition, we hypothesize that lack of gravitational loading on lumbar discs during microgravity will lead to extracellular matrix damage and significantly reduced disc compression performance following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. To test our hypotheses, we will harvest and test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 15 and 30-days of actual microgravity on STS-131 and Bion-M1. Spines will be frozen and transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods of testing nucleus pulposus swelling pressure, lumbar disc dimensions, proteoglycan content, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 15- and 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures.    <P>
Separately, evidence suggests headward fluid shifts alone influence bone alteration. However, most conclusions are drawn from human bed rest studies and hindlimb unloading of rats aimed to simulate actual weightlessness. As a member of NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program, our lab acquired murine calvariae from a 15-day mission aboard Space Shuttle STS-131. In concordance with current theory, we hypothesized that compared to ground control mice, headward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity will induce adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight. <P></td>

						1) Research Products: We have used state-of-the-art technologies to quantify morphology, biochemistry, and kinematics of spines (including the vertebrae, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, and spinal muscles) of mice after 15 and 30 days of actual microgravity.  Our research group is uniquely positioned to compare these data from animal models to that of changes that occur in crew members following 6-month ISS missions (NASA Awards NNX10AM18G and NNX13AM89G “Risk of Intervertebral Disc Damage after Prolonged Space Flight”).    <P>
2) Type of Investigation:  Space Flight    <P>
3) Relevance of the Research Products to NASA: We completed a well-documented and validated battery of histological, biochemical, and biomechanical measures, developed and validated to identify and quantify spinal features for mice during space flight.      <P>
We hypothesized that disuse and subsequent decrements in spinal muscle structure and function lead to alterations in biomechanical and biological pathomechanisms. First, microgravity leads to supraphysiologic disc swelling and increased disc height that may stiffen the lumbar motion segment and cause abnormal segmental movement patterns. These biomechanical changes may increase risk for disc degradation, vertebral endplate microfracture, and facet joint capsule strain. Second, swollen and unloaded discs in microgravity may have reduced nuclear matrix production and nutrient transport from endplate capillaries in adjacent vertebra. We propose that these factors may adversely affect disc cell metabolism, inducing disc matrix degradation (via decreased proteoglycan (PG) synthesis and increased secretion of matrix metalloproteinases).  Moreover, the impaired nutrient transport may adversely affect vertebral bone homeostasis.    <P>
4) Map to Human Research Program Integrated Research plan: Our project directly addresses Critical Path Roadmap Risks and Questions regarding disc injury (IRP Gap-B4): Is damage to joint structure, intervertebral discs, or ligaments incurred during or following microgravity exposure? Our research will improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of spinal deconditioning induced by microgravity, and mechanisms of spinal adaptation following re-exposure to 1-G. Our long-term goal is to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures. The goal of this research is to comprehensively characterize 15 and 30 days space-flight and recovery induced changes in spinal tissue morphology, biochemistry, and biomechanics of mice.     <P>
5) Productivity of NASA-Funded Research: Our research team has two NASA grants to study spines and their adaptations to actual microgravity: one grant to test mice exposed to 15 and 30 days of actual space flight (STS-131 and Bion, respectively) and another grant to test 12 ISS crew members before and after 180 days of actual space flight.  In addition, our group was selected as part of a tissue sharing opportunity to initiate a new NASA project to study spines and calvaria from rats exposed to 90-days hind-limb suspension.  Thus, from a scientific standpoint, it is highly desirable to compare results from the present 15 and 30 days of actual microgravity to those changes that occur in ISS crew members following approximately 180 days of actual microgravity.  It is known that prolonged exposure to microgravity causes degeneration of the human spine, indicated by low back pain during space flight and increased incidence of post-space flight herniated nucleus pulposus. We examined the effect that microgravity poses on biomechanical properties of lumbar and caudal discs from mice on 15 day shuttle mission STS-131. Sixteen mice (space flight group, n=8; control group, n=8) were sacrificed immediately after space flight. For caudal discs, the space flight group exhibited a 32% (p=0.012) lower physiologic disc height and 70% (p=0.02) lower strain dependence compared to the control mice. Decreases in both disc height and strain dependence indicate disc degeneration and injurious effect of microgravity. By contrast, differences were not noted for lumbar discs. This potentially deleterious interaction between prolonged weightlessness and differential range of motion along the spine may underlie the increased cervical versus lumbar disc herniation rates observed among astronauts (Johnston et al., 2010).     <P>
The increased herniation risk is highest during the first post-space flight year, and gradually subsides thereafter (Johnston et al., 2010). Consequently, we also hypothesized that the biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc deteriorate during space flight but then recover after acclimation to normal gravity. To test this hypothesis, we compared the compressive creep properties of caudal discs after return from a 13-day Shuttle mission (STS-133) to those of ground-based control mice.  Six flight and ten control mice were sacrificed +1 day, +5 days, or +7 days after the landing of STS-133. Compared to controls, space flight mice had 12% lower disc height and 21% lower strain-dependence on swelling pressure. In addition, biomechanical properties did not recover significantly over the 7-day post-flight period. Overall, biomechanical properties of the caudal discs were diminished by space flight, consistent with observations that prolonged exposure to microgravity increases disc herniation risk. These properties did not recover after short-term (7-days) re-acclimation to 1-G loading. Our separate studies of skull bones documented significantly increased growth and elastic modulus of skull bones following 15-days of microgravity exposure (Zhang et al., 2013).     <P>
Space flight Decreases Bending Strength and Alters Failure Mode in Murine Spinal Segments.  Introduction: The effects of microgravity during space flight negatively impact the human spine and lead to increased risk for low back pain and injury. Intervertebral disc herniation risk is increased 4.3-fold following space flight [1]. Animal models are often used to study the effects of space flight on the spine, and compressive creep properties have been shown to decrease in mice post-space flight [2]. However, uniaxial compression alone does not cause disc herniation. Rather, hyper-flexion is a significant contributor to herniation, i.e. during heavy lifting in a flexed posture [3]. Due to the observed increase in herniation risk following space flight, we hypothesized that the bending strength of discs is decreased under microgravity conditions. The effects of space flight on spine bending properties have not previously been studied.    <P>
The specific aims of the current study were to determine: (1) mechanical bending properties; and (2) locations of bending failure in murine spinal segments following space flight. We hypothesized that biomechanical bending properties of post-flight mouse discs would be diminished and that specimens would fail within the annulus fibrosus or at the annular insertion to the vertebra.    <P>
Materials and Methods: The 14 animals used for this study were obtained through NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Six mice were sent on a 30-day microgravity Bion M1 mission and acclimated to 1-G for 12 hours before they were sacrificed, while eight mice remained on the ground for the 30 days in standard vivarium cages. BSP personnel sacrificed mice and dissected and flash froze tissues. We received isolated frozen tails from the six post-space flight mice (flight, n=6) and eight ground vivarium controls (control, n=8).    <P>
The C3-C4 motion segment was isolated from each tail. The ventral side of each motion segment was marked with tissue dye to track orientation. Surrounding ligaments and soft tissues were removed to isolate the discs and vertebrae, and each specimen was radiographed to estimate disc height and cross-sectional area. Specimens were kept hydrated with phosphate buffered saline throughout tissue preparation. Each motion segment was placed in a custom 3D-printed four-point bending device such that the plane of bending coincided with the ventral-dorsal plane. This bending device had stainless steel rods inserted through the top and bottom pieces, perpendicular to the plane of bending, to create the four contact points. The lower supports of the bending system were spaced 7.5 mm apart, while the upper supports were spaced 2.5 mm apart and attached to the moving cross-head of a materials test system (ElectroForce 3200; Bose, Eden Prairie, MN). Specimens were preloaded between 0 and 5 mm at a rate of 0.05 mm/sec for 5 cycles, and then loaded to failure at 0.006 mm/sec. Ramping was terminated after failure, characterized by a drop in force of 1.5 N. From force-displacement data, the toe region was defined as the displacement corresponding to an applied force of 1 N, the stiffness was defined as the slope of the most linear region, and the strength was defined as the maximum load before failure. Paired t-tests were used to assess differences in failure strength, failure displacement, toe region length, and disc height between the control and flight groups.    <P>
Results: Space flight reduced bending strength by 17% (6.27 ± 0.94 vs. 7.53 ± 1.13 N, p < 0.05) and reduced toe region by 32% (0.53 ± 0.13 vs. 0.77 ± 0.21 mm, p < 0.05) with no significant effect on bending stiffness (p > 0.25). Disc height was reduced by 16% in flight mice (0.25 ± 0.03 vs. 0.29 ± 0.04 mm, p = 0.054).     <P>
	The two modes of failure identified by histology were: separation within the growth plate; and annulus avulsion at the disc-vertebra junction. Post-flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate while control spinal segments tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Polarized light microscopy showed annulus collagen fibers inserting into the cartilage endplate but not continuing through the endplate to the subchondral bone.    <P>
Discussion: The reduction in bending strength following space flight supports our hypothesis that reduced bending properties may be an important factor for explaining microgravity-associated increased herniation risk. The reduction in toe region is consistent with reports of decreased range of motion in astronauts, and the shortened disc height is consistent with prior studies investigating post-flight mice [2]. All specimens failed at soft-hard tissue interfaces between cartilage and bone, presumably due to stress concentrations caused by abrupt changes in material properties at these junctions. The increased likelihood of post-flight mice to fail at the growth plate before the disc-vertebra junction suggests a decrease in growth plate integrity, and may explain the reduction in bending strength without a corresponding reduction in stiffness.     <P>
   The results of this study motivate future work investigating the underlying biochemical and structural mechanisms of growth plate failure in flight mice. Previous work suggests that chondrocyte polarity and TGF-ß family signaling are essential for growth plate health [4,5]. A thorough investigation of these traits in post-flight mice may illuminate effects of microgravity that compromise murine growth plate integrity.    <P>
   A limitation of animal models used in shuttle missions is the lack of clarity on whether post-flight changes are caused by the same mechanisms as in human astronauts. Microgravity likely has different effects on murine spines due to anatomical and physiological differences. The growth plate separations observed in this study are not relevant to adult humans, but may provide insight for mechanisms of vertebral growth plate fractures observed in children before growth plate closure. Interestingly, mice have been observed using their tails to move about inflight enclosures [2], which may be a confounding variable in accelerating disc degeneration. It should also be noted that the flight mice in this study acclimated to 1-G for 12 hours before they were sacrificed, and the effects on tissue properties during this period are unknown. Despite these limitations, this study provides the first analysis of bending properties of intervertebral discs following space flight and provides insight into possible mechanisms for increased herniation risk following space flight.    <P>
Significance: Intervertebral disc herniation risk is increased over 4-fold following space flight. Here we show the first evidence that bending properties of spinal segments are decreased following space flight, which may contribute to increased herniation risk.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs of the spine are important, weight-bearing tissues that are adapted to gravitational stress. The absence of gravitational axial loads on the body during exposure to microgravity may disrupt normal spine physiology and function. During microgravity exposure, deconditioning of the intervertebral discs and spinal tissues poses a serious risk upon re-exposure to 1-G and exercise. Our recent data in identical twins exposed to 30-days bed rest indicate that compressibility increases in the lumbar spine and its intervertebral discs during 30-days simulated microgravity. Because intervertebral discs become more collapsible during simulated microgravity, the probability of disc prolapse or herniation upon re-exposure to gravity increases.    <P>
We hypothesize that nucleus pulposus swelling pressures in mouse spines will significantly decrease following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. In addition, we hypothesize that lack of gravitational loading on lumbar discs during microgravity will lead to extracellular matrix damage and significantly reduced disc compression performance following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. To test our hypotheses, we will harvest and test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 15 and 30-days of actual microgravity on STS-131 and Bion-M1. Spines will be frozen and transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods of testing nucleus pulposus swelling pressure, lumbar disc dimensions, proteoglycan content, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 15- and 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures.    <P>
Separately, evidence suggests headward fluid shifts alone influence bone alteration. However, most conclusions are drawn from human bed rest studies and hindlimb unloading of rats aimed to simulate actual weightlessness. As a member of NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program, our lab acquired murine calvariae from a 15-day mission aboard Space Shuttle STS-131. In concordance with current theory, we hypothesized that compared to ground control mice, headward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity will induce adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the effects of 15- and 30-days space flight on spinal deconditioning in mice.  The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs are important, weight-bearing tissues that have adapted to gravitational stress.  Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 15- and 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures.  This research may aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during inactivity such as after spinal cord injury and bed rest in human patients on Earth.    <P>
Separately, our studies of mouse skull calvaria demonstrate the influence of the fluid shift associated with microgravity on bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading. The findings may be considered in the development of strategies to counter bone loss in astronauts and patients confined to bed rest. <P></td>

						To test our hypotheses, we harvested and will test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 30-days of actual microgravity on Bion-M1. Spines were frozen and will be transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods to test intervertebral disc morphology, cell content, water content, swelling pressure, GAG and PG concentrations, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity, STS-131 flight mice, and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures.    <P>
When the specimens arrive at our facilities at UCSD and UCSF, we plan: (1) To measure intervertebral disc morphology, cell content, swelling pressure, water content, and GAG and PG concentrations after exposure to 30 days of microgravity and compare to STS-131 flight mice and ground-control animals.  (2) To measure time-dependent and time-independent disc compression stiffness after exposure to 30 days of microgravity and compare to STS-131 flight mice and ground-control animals. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs of the spine are important, weight-bearing tissues that are adapted to gravitational stress. The absence of gravitational axial loads on the body during exposure to microgravity may disrupt normal spine physiology and function. During microgravity exposure, deconditioning of the intervertebral discs and spinal tissues poses a serious risk upon re-exposure to 1-G and exercise. Our recent data in identical twins exposed to 30-days bed rest indicate that compressibility increases in the lumbar spine and its intervertebral discs during 30-days simulated microgravity. Because  intervertebral discs become more collapsible during simulated microgravity, the probability of disc prolapse or herniation upon re-exposure to gravity increases.    <P>
We hypothesize that nucleus pulposus swelling pressures in mouse spines will significantly decrease following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. In addition, we hypothesize that lack of gravitational loading on lumbar discs during microgravity will lead to extracellular matrix damage and significantly reduced disc compression performance following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. To test our hypotheses, we will harvest and test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 15 and 30-days of actual microgravity on STS-131 and Bion-M1. Spines will be frozen and transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods of testing nucleus pulposus swelling pressure, lumbar disc dimensions, proteoglycan content, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 15- and 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures.    <P>
Separately, evidence suggests headward fluid shifts alone influence bone alteration. However, most conclusions are drawn from human bed rest studies and hindlimb unloading of rats aimed to simulate actual weightlessness. As a member of NASA’s Biospecimen Sharing Program, our lab acquired murine calvariae from a 15-day mission aboard Space Shuttle STS-131. In concordance with current theory, we hypothesized that compared to ground control mice, headward fluid shifts in mice exposed to microgravity will induce adaptive growth in bones that normally do not bear weight. <P></td>

						I. The Effects of Microgravity on Mice Lumbar Vertebral Bone Structure    <P>
INTRODUCTION:  Extended exposure to microgravity during spaceflight has been associated with bone remodeling. Reduced mechanical loading, due to hypodynamia (decreased forces) and hypokinesia (fewer movements), was thought to lead to decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) during spaceflight.  Previous studies have indeed reported decreased bone mass and vertebral BMD during long-term spaceflight.  The use of micro-computed tomography (µCT) has recently been established to characterize deterioration of the micro-architecture of bone tissue, and to measure the BMD. With the support of NASA’s mission STS-131 with the Space Shuttle Discovery, mice lumbar spines from microgravity conditions (15 days) were obtained. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of microgravity on mice lumbar vertebral bone structure using µCT imaging.    <P>
METHODS:    <P>
Sample: Fifteen C57BL/6 mice were used, primarily for immunological research regarding the ability to activate protective immune responses during microgravity. The flight group (n=8, average weight 25 g) was sent to space on mission STS-131 with NASA’s Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) and experienced microgravity for fifteen days. The AEM is a self-contained environment that holds up to eight adult mice and provides the mice with light, food, water, shelter, and ventilation. The control group (n=7) remained on Earth (Kennedy Space Center, FL) under the same conditions as the AEM (humidity, temperature, etc.). Upon arrival, the animals were euthanized, and the lumbar spines (L3 to L6) were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transported frozen to the University of California, San Diego. Micro-Computed Tomography: L3-L6 lumbar spines were imaged on a µCT scanner, Skyscan 1076.    <P>
RESULTS:  Trabecular bone thickness in the flight group showed a trend lower values compared to the control group (p=0.11). Trabecular bone thickness at the caudal location in the flight group was significantly less than that of the control group (p<0.05), while trabecular bone thickness at the caudal location showed no difference. The flight group also showed a decrease of trabecular bone thickness at L6 compared to the control group (p<0.05), but not other levels.    <P>
DISCUSSION:   In this study, the bone structure parameters in the flight group showed a trend of decrease compared to the control group. These decreases were more evident in caudal lumbar vertebra than in cranial vertebra.  These results suggested the biomechanical condition of lumbar spine may have resulted in different responses to microgravity.   The use of µCT imaging contributed to micro-architecture deterioration of trabecular bone in the lumbar vertebral body induced by a 15 day period of microgravity. This finding indicated that the loss of bone mass and mineralization may occur mainly in the center of the vertebral body under microgravity conditions.      <P>

II. The Effects of Microgravity on Mice Lumbar Disc MR Properties    <P>
INTRODUCTION: Extended exposure to microgravity during spaceflight has been associated with increased incidences of back pain in astronauts. In animals, signs of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration such as decreased proteoglycan content has been found. MRI is increasingly used for routine disc evaluation, and T2 quantification is sensitive to IVD hydration and proteoglycan content, as well as therapeutic repair of IVDs in animal models. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 15-day spaceflight on MR properties of IVD in mice that experienced microgravity.    <P>
METHODS:  Samples - Black congenic C57BL/6 mice (average weight of 25 g) were obtained from a non-treatment group at the NASA tissue share program. They were intended for immunological research regarding the ability to activate protective immune responses during microgravity. One group of mice was sent to space on mission STS-131 with NASA’s Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) and experienced microgravity for 15 days (Flight; n=8). Another group (Control; n=8) stayed on Earth (Kennedy Space Center, FL) under the same conditions as the AEM (i.e., humidity and temperature). Upon arrival, the animals were euthanized, and the lumbar spines were harvested from each animal, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transported frozen to the MRI facility.  MRI Analysis – Spines were thawed, placed into plastic tubing with closed ends, and imaged using a 3T GE Signa HDx with a 1 cm diameter solenoid coil.     RESULTS:  In T2-weighted images, no discernible differences were found between the two groups. T2 values of the nucleus pulposus ranged from ~60 ms to 75 ms, and tended to be higher in the Control than the Flight animals. Statistically, the nucleus pulposus varied significantly with level (p<0.001) but not with microgravity and flight (p=0.5). T2 values of the nucleus pulposus were to be the lowest in L6/S1 and L5/6 compared to other levels (posthoc p<0.05). T2 values of the annulus fibrosis also tended to vary with level (p=0.08) but not with spaceflight (p=0.3), even though a trend of lower T2 values in the Flight group was apparent. In the annulus fibrosis, T2 values in the L1/2 was higher than those in the L6/S1 (p<0.05).     <P>
DISCUSSION:  Although failing to reach statistical significance due to animal variability, a visible trend of decreasing T2 values in both annulus fibrosis and nucleus pulposus after spaceflight was observed. Additional samples may be needed to reduce animal variability, and longer duration flight may amplify the difference in the MR property. In bed rest studies, durations ~>10 weeks were needed to have a long-lasting effect on disc area.     <P>
SIGNIFICANCE: Quantitative MRI may be a sensitive tool for evaluation of disc degeneration associated with spaceflight.    <P>
III. Prolonged microgravity degenerates biomechanical properties of the murine caudal intervertebral discs     <P>
INTRODUCTION:  	Prolonged exposure to microgravity has adverse effects on the human intervertebral disc (IVD), causing low back pain during spaceflight and an increased incidence of post-spaceflight herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP). Cervical HNP incidence among an astronaut sample population was nearly 5-fold higher compared to a control population, while incidence of lumbar HNP was not significantly different. Theoretically, microgravity increases spinal injury risk by removing diurnal loading that expels IVD fluid that has been osmotically imbibed during bed rest. Discs freely swell throughout the entire flight, leading to increased disc height and spinal stiffness among astronauts.        	We propose that degenerative effects of microgravity will vary among spinal regions due to level-dependent differences in range of motion (ROM). Specifically, imposing larger ROM on microgravity stiffened spinal segments could cause accelerated degeneration and increased HNP risk immediately post-spaceflight. As part of the Biospecimen Sharing Program with NASA, we acquired murine lumbar spines and tails from STS-131, a 15-day shuttle mission. We hypothesize the caudal IVD will exhibit a greater difference in biomechanical properties between the spaceflight and ground control mice due to the greater ROM at caudal segments compared to lumbar segments.     <P>
METHODS:    <P>
Animals.  	Sixteen female, 16-week-old, wild-type C57BL/C mice were separated into two groups. The spaceflight group (n=8 mice) were exposed to microgravity for 15 days during NASA shuttle mission STS-131. The control group (n=8 mice) was maintained under normal gravitational loads on the ground. Following spaceflight, mice were sacrificed immediately post-landing. Eight caudal specimens (C9/C10) and sixteen lumbar specimens (L4/L5) were utilized for testing. Specimens were radiographed prior to dissection to attain a measure of physiologic disc height. Motion segments were harvested and then dissected by removing extraneous soft-tissue, as well as, posterior elements from the lumbar specimens.      <P>
Mechanical Testing:   	The motion segments were fixed to the testing apparatus (Bose Electroforce 3200) and radiographed again to measure the disc cross-sectional area and initial disc height at the start of the test. Testing included five cycles of compressive creep loading at 0.5 MPa for 20 minutes with 40 minutes recovery at 0.1 MPa. The first four cycles were used for preconditioning and the last cycle was used for data collection and analysis.     <P>
RESULTS:   	Seven of the eight caudal IVDs contributed usable data. Within that set, the spaceflight specimens (n=4) demonstrated 32% (p=0.012) decrease in physiologic disc height and 70% decrease in strain-dependence of swelling pressure, D (p=0.02) compared to the ground control mice (n=3). D was moderately correlated with disc height (R2=0.56, p=0.0013).     <P>
DISCUSSION:  	The spaceflight caudal IVDs showed significant decreases in physiological disc height and strain dependence (D) compared to the corresponding ground controls. Decreases in either variable are indicative of disc degeneration, indicating that microgravity has an injurious effect on the caudal IVD. By contrast, differences were not noted for lumbar IVDs.   	Lumbar spine movement is constrained by the disc, the ligaments, and the facet joints. In the tail however, there are no facets, and as a result, the range of motion is larger and constrained principally by the disc. Consequently, when supra-physiologic nuclear swelling from prolonged weightlessness increases disc bending stiffness, this can be more problematical in the tail.   	This potentially deleterious interaction between prolonged weightlessness and spine range of motion may underlie the increased cervical versus lumbar disc herniation rates observed in crewmembers. In humans, the cervical range of motion is significantly greater than the in the lumbar spine for both flexion/extension and axial rotation. The incidence of cervical HNP is 21.4-times higher after spaceflight, while the lumbar HNP was not significantly higher. If these results are confirmed, they suggest countermeasure efforts should focus on protecting spinal movement upon return to Earth’s gravity while nucleus swelling can acclimate to terresterial conditions.    <P>
SIGNIFICANCE:  	This study shows that prolonged microgravity could have degenerative effects on IVDs at levels with a greater range of motion. Results could influence potential countermeasures to be used during spaceflight to reduce the occurrence of HNP.     <P>
  IV. Post-spaceflight recovery of biomechanical properties in murine caudal intervertebral discs    <P>
INTRODUCTION:  	Prolonged exposure to microgravity during spaceflight adversely affects human intervertebral disc (IVD) increasing the incidence of disc herniation post-spaceflight. The risk of disc herniation is highest during the first year and subsides over time, but persisting at high risk for up to 3 years post-spaceflight. We hypothesize that the biomechanical properties of the IVD undergo degeneration during prolonged exposure to microgravity and that biomechanical properties gradually recover during acclimation to gravitational loads post-flight. We will test this hypothesis by comparing the creep compressive properties of caudal IVDs belonging to murine subjects from STS-133 to control IVDs.     <P>
METHODS:  Sixteen female, 13-week-old, wild-type BALB/c mice were divided into the spaceflight group (n = 6 mice) and the control group (n =10 mice). Mice were sacrificed at three different post-landing time points: +1 day of recovery (spaceflight, n=2; control, n=3), +5 days of recovery (spaceflight, n=2; control, n=4), and +7 days of recovery (spaceflight, n=2; control, n=3). Discs were subjected to five cycles of compressive creep loading at 0.5 MPa for 20 min with 40 min recovery. The displacement vs. time data were fit to a fluid transport model to calculate tissue permeability (K), time-dependence of annular strain (G), and strain-dependence of nucleus swelling pressure (D).      <P>
RESULTS:   	The spaceflight group exhibited a 12% decrease in physiological disc height (p=0.0987) and a 21 % decrease in D (p = 0.1346) compared to controls. We found no significant effect of post-flight recovery time on the biomechanical properties. We observed no significant differences for the creep parameters K and G.     <P>
DISCUSSION:  	We found that prolonged exposure to microgravity tended to diminish the biomechanical properties of the murine caudal IVD. This supports the claim that microgravity induces degenerative changes to the IVD; however it remains unclear whether these changes are reversible upon re-acclimation to gravitational loads. The lack of significant differences in biomechanical properties between the three recovery periods could be a result of the small sample size (n=2 for each spaceflight mice time point). It may also reflect the short duration of recovery time.     <P>
V.  Fifteen Days Microgravity Causes Growth in Murine Calvaria on STS-131    <P>
INTRODUCTION:  Bone remodeling occurs in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and headward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows may elicit an opposite effect. In bones that normally do not bear weight, we hypothesized that the headward fluid shift accompanying microgravity can induce adaptive growth in skull-bone structure. We investigate this relationship by comparing the calvariae of mice exposed to 15-days microgravity compared to ground-control mice.    <P>
METHODS:  Seven of 15 wild-type C57BL/6 mice littermates were randomly chosen to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, and the remaining eight mice served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all calvariae were imaged on a micro-Computed Tomography scanner (Skyscan 1076). A standardized rectangular volume (18mm3) was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analysis. The parietal bones were chosen to represent the calvaria due to their central locations on the skullcap. Three parameters that characterized bone growth were determined: bone volume (BV; expressed as % of the standardized rectangular volume), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh; expressed in mm), and tissue mineral density (TMD; expressed in g/cc).     <P>
RESULTS:  Increases of spaceflight group (SF) over ground control group (GC) were seen in all three parameters. BV was increased (p<0.05) from a mean of 9.64% ±0.79 in the GC group to 10.48% ±0.47 in the SF group, with the relative difference being +8.7%. CsTh showed a trend of increase (p=0.12) from a mean of 0.099mm ±0.006 in the GC group to 0.104mm ±0.005 in the SF group, with the relative difference being +5.1%. TMD was similar between the two groups (p=0.31) with a mean of 0.878g/cc ±0.029 in the GC group, 0.893g/cc ± 0.028 in the SF group, and a relative difference of 1.8%.     <P>
DISCUSSION:  Our results suggest that head-ward fluid shifts associated with microgravity initiate adaptive growth in bones that don’t normally bear weight. The findings also indicate the capability of a fluid shift to affect bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs of the spine are important, weight-bearing tissues that are adapted to gravitational stress. The absence of gravitational axial loads on the body during exposure to microgravity may disrupt normal spine physiology and function. During microgravity exposure, deconditioning of the intervertebral discs and spinal tissues poses a serious risk upon re-exposure to 1-G and exercise. Our recent data in identical twins exposed to 30-days bed rest indicate that compressibility increases in the lumbar spine and its intervertebral discs during 30-days simulated microgravity. Because  intervertebral discs become more collapsible during simulated microgravity, the probability of disc prolapse or herniation upon re-exposure to gravity increases.    <P>
We hypothesize that nucleus pulposus swelling pressures in mouse spines will significantly decrease following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. In addition, we hypothesize that lack of gravitational loading on lumbar discs during microgravity will lead to extracellular matrix  damage and significantly reduced disc compression performance following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. To test our hypotheses, we will harvest and test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 15 and 30-days of actual microgravity on STS-131 and Bion-M1. Spines will be frozen and transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods of testing nucleus pulposus swelling pressure, lumbar disc dimensions, proteoglycan content, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 15- and 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures. <P></td>

						Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of microgravity on intervertebral discs.  Also, we hypothesize that there is an increase in water content in the brains of “flight mice” versus the brains of “ground control mice.”    <P>
Methods: Eight C57BL/6 mice (16-weeks old) were divided into two groups: 1) exposed to microgravity conditions during a 15-day NASA mission, STS-131; and 2) ground-based controls. After animal sacrifice, the caudal intervertebral discs were first imaged by x-ray to calculate disc height and cross-sectional area. Then the C7/C8 motion segments were harvested for biomechanical testing. Discs were subjected to five cycles of compressive creep loading at 0.5 MPa for 20 min with 40 min recovery. The displacement vs. time data were fit to a fluid transport model to calculate tissue permeability (K), time-dependence of annular strain (G), and strain-dependence of nucleus swelling pressure (D).  We also studied the effects of 15 days of microgravity exposure on disc structure of flight mice compared with ground control mice.  Separately, wet and dry weights of flight and control mice brains were measured.    <P>
Results: We observed that flight discs were 32% shorter (p=0.012) and had a 70% decrease in D (p=0.02) compared to controls. D was moderately correlated with disc height (R2=0.56, p=0.0013). No statistically significant differences were observed for K and G.      In our morphology studies, we documented a loss of disc height during 15 days of microgravity. In particular, a marked disc height loss at the L5/6 level and L6/S1, the lower lumbar level, was found.     <P>
In our brain studies, a significant difference is opposite to what we hypothesized with the control mice having more brain water than flight mice.     <P>
Discussion and Conclusions: These differences in D and height are comparable with historical data for mouse caudal discs degenerated by static compressive loading. Consequently, our data suggest that 15-days of microgravity induce intervertebral disc degeneration.     <P>
Separately, in our morphology studies, we documented a loss of disc height, possibly due to degeneration of the discs, during 15 days of microgravity. In particular, a marked disc height loss at the L5/6 level and L6/S1, the lower lumbar level, was found.  This parallels somewhat the high incidence of lumbar disc herniation in astronauts (Johnston et al., 2010). Additionally, decreased disc height at the posterior zone was documented in our study, suggesting increased lordosis. In the MRI analyses, the differences between the control and flight groups were not significant. To assess further the effects of microgravity on the spine, other means of examination (e.g., bone mineral density and trabecular analysis) are currently on-going.    <P>
Because the anatomical features were not the same between mice and humans (i.e. the meninges is not represented with the mice and we sampled a region rostral of the optic chiasm), the current data do not necessarily contradict the previous human data.  Obtaining the meninges and earlier freezing of brain tissues should be considered for future studies.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs of the spine are important, weight-bearing tissues that are adapted to gravitational stress. The absence of gravitational axial loads on the body during exposure to microgravity may disrupt normal spine physiology and function. During microgravity exposure, deconditioning of the intervertebral discs and spinal tissues poses a serious risk upon re-exposure to 1-G and exercise. Our recent data in identical twins exposed to 30-days bed rest indicate that compressibility increases in the lumbar spine and its intervertebral discs during 30-days simulated microgravity. Because  intervertebral discs become more collapsible during simulated microgravity, the probability of disc prolapse or herniation upon re-exposure to gravity increases.    <P>
We hypothesize that nucleus pulposus swelling pressures in mouse spines will significantly decrease following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. In addition, we hypothesize that lack of gravitational loading on lumbar discs during microgravity will lead to extracellular matrix  damage and significantly reduced disc compression performance following 15- and 30-days of microgravity. To test our hypotheses, we will harvest and test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 15 and 30-days of actual microgravity on STS-131 and Bion-M1. Spines will be frozen and transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods of testing nucleus pulposus swelling pressure, lumbar disc dimensions, proteoglycan content, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 15- and 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> The vertebral bodies and flexible intervertebral discs of the spine are important, weight-bearing tissues that are adapted to gravitational stress. The absence of gravitational axial loads on the body during exposure to microgravity may disrupt normal spine physiology and function. During microgravity exposure, deconditioning of the intervertebral discs and spinal tissues poses a serious risk upon re-exposure to 1-G upright posture and exercise. Our recent data in identical twins exposed to 30-days bed rest indicate that compressibility increases in the lumbar spine and its intervertebral discs during 30-days simulated microgravity. Because  intervertebral discs become more collapsible during simulated microgravity, the probability of disc prolapse or herniation upon re-exposure to gravity increases.    <P>
We hypothesize that nucleus pulposus swelling pressures in mouse spines will significantly decrease following 30-days of microgravity. In addition, we hypothesize that lack of gravitational loading on lumbar discs during microgravity will lead to extracellular matrix  damage and significantly reduced disc compression performance following 30-days of microgravity. To test our hypotheses, we will harvest and test spines from ground-based control mice and flight mice exposed to 30-days of actual microgravity on Bion-M1. Spines  will be frozen and transported to UCSD and UCSF for accepted methods of testing nucleus pulposus swelling pressure, lumbar disc dimensions, proteoglycan content, and spine biomechanics. We will compare the results of the present study to our peer-reviewed and  published results for identical twins exposed to 30-days simulated microgravity and control mice exposed to 1-G. Our research will aid understanding of spinal deconditioning during 30-days microgravity and of the higher incidence of disc prolapse or herniation following re-exposure to 1-G with a long-term view to prevent such spinal deconditioning with exercise or other physiologic countermeasures. <P></td>
