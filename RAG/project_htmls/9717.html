                    <td colspan="3"> Soft tissue injuries often occur at the sites of attachment of tendons and ligament to bone, the so-called "insertion sites". The sensitivity of the musculoskeletal system to its mechanical environment may magnify the injury susceptibility of insertion sites during prolonged exposure to microgravity. Changes in loading across joints, as would occur during a long stay on the International Space Station or during a trip to Mars, will lead to changes in tissue mechanical, structural, and biochemical properties. Joint unloading will result in a catabolic biologic state and subsequent tissue degeneration. Physiologic joint loading, on the other hand, will result in an anabolic biologic state and maintenance of tissue properties. Joint deterioration during space flight would significantly increase the risk of injury to the tendons and ligaments which provide function and stability to joints. These injuries do not heal well (e.g., the failure rate for repaired rotator cuff repairs may be as high as 94%) and will severely debilitate an injured astronaut. The negative effect of unloading has most clearly been demonstrated in bone and muscle. Less is known, however, about the effect of weightlessness on joint soft tissues. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to examine the effect of prolonged weightlessness on the mechanical and biochemical properties of muscles, tendons, and their insertions into bone. We are studying the tendon-to-bone insertions of animals subjected to 14 – 30 days of weightlessness through the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) organized for the STS-131, STS-133, STS-135, and the Bion-M1 missions. These shared animals allow us to examine joint degeneration due to weightlessness by comparing the weightless group to a control group on Earth. Outcome measures include assessment of the mechanical, structural, genetic, and compositional properties of mouse tendon-to-bone insertions. These analyses are performed on mice whose procedures and objectives were associated with the primary research focus of this research program. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Musculoskeletal injuries are a common cause of pain and disability, and result in significant health care costs.  Approximately 30% of work related injuries in the United States each year are to the upper extremity. At the rotator cuff, tendon-to-bone repair techniques have been plagued by a high rate of recurrent tears, ranging from 20-94%. There is little scientific basis for the current clinical management of this injury.  Regeneration of the insertion site of the tendon is critical for the restoration of tendon function and for the prevention of re-injury. However, clinical and animal model studies have demonstrated a lack of healing potential after tendon-to-bone injury and repair.    <P>
Musculoskeletal tissues are sensitive to their mechanical environment. Increased loading (e.g., through exercise) generally leads to an increase in mechanical properties, while decreased loading (e.g., through immobilization) generally leads to decreases in mechanical properties. For example, bone adapts to its loading environment by remodeling its architecture to optimally transfer stresses. Unloading leads to rapid resorption of bone and a decrease in bone mineral density. Increased loading, on the other hand, promotes new bone formation and an increase in bone mineral density. These changes are especially evident at the bony end of the tendon-to-bone insertion. Understanding the responses of tendons and their bony insertions to a weightless environment will allow us to develop strategies for preventing tendon-to-bone injuries and/or improving the healing response of tendon-to-bone injuries for humans on Earth. <P></td>

						SUMMARY OF PAST YEAR’S RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS    <P>
Muscles, tendons, and bony insertions of animals subjected to 13-30 days of weightlessness on shuttle missions STS-131 and STS-135 (13-15 days microgravity + ~3 hours recovery), and Bion-M1 (30 days microgravity + ~13 hrs recovery) were studied. We completed the following in the fifth year of the grant: assessment of rotator cuff muscles/tendons/insertions from STS-131/135 and Bion-M1 and further assessment of Achilles tendons/insertions from Bion-M1. Specimens from STS-133 are currently being stored for future analysis. Bion-M1 launched on April 19, 2013 and landed on May 19, 2013. A number of animals flew on this mission; 6 of the mice on the satellite were allocated to the NASA BSP investigators. An additional 8 mice were housed at the Russian Federation Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP) to serve as ground vivarium controls. Left and right shoulders (humerus-rotator cuff-scapula units) and ankles (Achilles tendon-calcaneous bone) were removed from each mouse approximately 12 hours after landing, processed, and shipped to our laboratory. Ongoing studies analyzing specimens from this and previous missions include: proteomics on rotator cuff mouse muscles, proteomics of hind paw flexor and extensor tendons, micro-computed tomography of the humeral head and calcaneal bones, biomechanics of the supraspinatus and Achilles tendon-to-bone insertions, and histology of supraspinatus tendon-humeral head and Achilles tendon-calcaneous samples.     <P>
1.	The effect of microgravity on tendons and their bony insertions    <P>
For tendons and their bony insertions, enzymatic degradation of the tissue by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was evident after tendon unloading and/or injury. Microgravity led to significant increases in MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression (data presented in previous progress report) for STS-131 supraspinatus samples (Bion M1 samples are currently being analyzed). This degradation was consistent with decreased collagen fibril diameters in tendons from Bion samples and decreased supraspinatus tendon cross-sectional areas from both STS-131/135 and Bion M1 samples. Surprisingly, decreased cross-sectional area did not result in changes in the force-deformation behavior of the tissue (e.g., failure force). When normalizing mechanical properties for cross-sectional area and length (i.e., stress-strain properties), an increase in the modulus and failure stress (strength) of the tendon-to-bone insertion was seen for both STS and Bion samples. The stiffer tendon-to-bone insertion may be indicative of early tissue pathology, as is seen in glycation-related stiffening of soft tissues in a number of diseases.     2.	The effect of microgravity on bone    <P>
Joint unloading on Earth or in space has been shown to cause a rapid loss of bone mineral mass.  Changes in mineral are typically due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, resulting in decreased mineral content as well as changes in the trabecular bone architecture. It is likely that similar bony changes will occur at tendon-to-bone insertions subjected to a weightless environment. Data from the STS-131 and STS-135, presented in the previous progress report, demonstrate that bone resorption is increased (as indicated by increases in the ratio of RANK-L to OPG gene expression) and osteoblast differentiation is decreased (as indicated by decreases in osterix and Runx-2 gene expression)). Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) were decreased due to microgravity. We are currently evaluating the gene expression and bony architecture or humeral heads and calcaneal bones from Bion animals.     <P>
3.	The effect of microgravity on the rotator cuff muscles    <P>
Contrasting results were seen when comparing gene and protein expression from STS and Bion flights. Microgravity significantly downregulated the expression of both myogenic and adipogenic genes after 15 days of microgravity + ~3 hrs of recovery in STS-131 animals (note: “recovery” indicates time elapsed from landing to sacrifice). The mRNA changes measured in myogenic factors indicated atrophy/degeneration of the muscles due to microgravity. Downregulation of genes related to the adipogenic program indicated that degeneration due to microgravity may occur through different pathways than degeneration due to tendon and/or nerve injury in gravity conditions. In contrast, opposite trends (or no effect) were seen after 30 days of microgravity + ~13 hrs of recovery in Bion-M1 animals. Proteomics analysis of muscles showed similar results. The gene and protein expression changes seen in the Bion-M1 muscles is likely due to initiation of a recovery phase after return of gravity loading. Expression changes can occur within hours of a loading event, whereas mass and functional changes may take days or weeks to manifest.    <P>
We are completing the analysis of Bion-M1 samples and preparing two manuscripts on the  results.    <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Soft tissue injuries often occur at the sites of attachment of tendons and ligament to bone, the so-called "insertion sites". The sensitivity of the musculoskeletal system to its mechanical environment may magnify the injury susceptibility of insertion sites during prolonged exposure to microgravity. Changes in loading across joints, as would occur during a long stay on the International Space Station or during a trip to Mars, will lead to changes in tissue mechanical, structural, and biochemical properties. Joint unloading will result in a catabolic biologic state and subsequent tissue degeneration. Physiologic joint loading, on the other hand, will result in an anabolic biologic state and maintenance of tissue properties. Joint deterioration during space flight would significantly increase the risk of injury to the tendons and ligaments which provide function and stability to joints. These injuries do not heal well (e.g., the failure rate for repaired rotator cuff repairs may be as high as 94%) and will severely debilitate an injured astronaut. The negative effect of unloading has most clearly been demonstrated in bone. Less is known, however, about the effect of weightlessness on joint soft tissues. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to examine the effect of prolonged weightlessness on the mechanical and biochemical properties of muscles, tendons, and their insertions into bone. We are studying the tendon-to-bone insertions of animals subjected to 14 – 30 days of weightlessness through the Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP) organized for the STS-131, STS-133, STS-135, and the Bion-M1 missions. These shared animals will allow us to examine joint degeneration due to weightlessness by comparing the weightless group to a control group on Earth. Outcome measures will include assessment of the mechanical, structural, genetic, and compositional properties of mouse tendon-to-bone insertions. These analyses will be performed on mice whose procedures and objectives were associated with the primary research focus of this research program. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Musculoskeletal injuries are a common cause of pain and disability, and result in significant health care costs.  Approximately 30% of work related injuries in the United States each year are to the upper extremity. At the rotator cuff, tendon-to-bone repair techniques have been plagued by a high rate of recurrent tears, ranging from 20-94%. There is little scientific basis for the current clinical management of this injury.  Regeneration of the insertion site of the tendon is critical for the restoration of tendon function and for the prevention of re-injury. However, clinical and animal model studies have demonstrated a lack of healing potential after tendon-to-bone injury and repair.    <P>
Musculoskeletal tissues are sensitive to their mechanical environment. Increased loading (e.g., through exercise) generally leads to an increase in mechanical properties, while decreased loading (e.g., through immobilization) generally leads to decreases in mechanical properties. For example, bone adapts to its loading environment by remodeling its architecture to optimally transfer stresses. Unloading leads to rapid resorption of bone and a decrease in bone mineral density. Increased loading, on the other hand, promotes new bone formation and an increase in bone mineral density. These changes are especially evident at the bony end of the tendon-to-bone insertion. Understanding the responses of tendons and their bony insertions to a weightless environment will allow us to develop strategies for preventing tendon-to-bone injuries and/or improving the healing response of tendon-to-bone injuries for humans on Earth. <P></td>

						Muscles, tendons, and bony insertions of animals subjected to 13-30 days of weightlessness on shuttle missions STS-131, STS-133, STS-135, and Bion-M1 were studied. We completed the following in the fourth year of the grant: sample collection after Bion-M1, further assessment of rotator cuff muscles/tendons/insertions from STS-131 and STS-135, and further assessment of Achilles tendons/insertions from STS-131. Specimens from STS-133 are currently being stored for future analysis. Bion-M1 launched on April 19, 2013 and landed on May 19, 2013. A number of animals flew on this mission; 6 of the mice on the satellite were allocated to the NASA BSP investigators. An additional 8 mice were housed at the Russian Federation Institute For Biomedical Problems (IMBP) to serve as ground vivarium controls. Left and right shoulders (humerus-rotator cuff-scapula units) and ankles (Achilles tendon-calcaneous bone) were removed from each mouse approximately 12 hours after landing, processed, and shipped to our laboratory. Ongoing studies analyzing specimens from this and previous missions include: biochemistry and proteomics on rotator cuff mouse muscles, micro-computed tomography on the humeral head bone, biomechanics on the supraspinatus tendon-to-bone insertion, and histology on supraspinatus tendon-humeral head and Achilles tendon-calcaneous samples. Furthermore, in the past year we have developed new methods to perform biomechanical tests on Achilles tendon-calcalneous samples. This will allow us to add a previously unavailable outcome to our samples from the Bion-M1 mission.    <P>
1.	The effect of microgravity on the rotator cuff tendons and their bony insertions.    <P>
For tendons and their bony insertions, enzymatic degradation of the tissue by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is evident after tendon unloading and/or injury. Microgravity led to significant increases in MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression. This degradation was consistent with an observed decrease in supraspinatus tendon cross-sectional area. Surprisingly, decreased cross-sectional area did not result in changes in the force-deformation behavior of the tissue (e.g., failure force). When normalizing mechanical properties for cross-sectional area and length (i.e., stress-strain properties), an increase in the modulus and failure stress (strength) of the tendon-to-bone insertion was seen. The stiffer tendon-to-bone insertion may be indicative of early tissue pathology, as is seen in glycation-related stiffening of soft tissues in a number of diseases.    <P>
2.	The effect of microgravity on the humeral head bone.    <P>
Joint unloading on Earth or in space has been shown to cause a rapid loss of bone mineral mass.  Changes in mineral are typically due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, resulting in decreased mineral content as well as changes in the trabecular bone architecture. It is likely that similar bony changes will occur at tendon-to-bone insertions subjected to a weightless environment. Data from the STS-131 and STS-135 demonstrate that bone resorption is increased (as indicated by increases in the ratio of RANK-L to OPG gene expression) and osteoblast differentiation is decreased (as indicated by decreases in osterix and Runx-2 gene expression)). Bone mineral density and trabecular thickness were decreased due to microgravity.    <P>
3.	The effect of microgravity on the rotator cuff muscles.    <P>
Microgravity significantly downregulated the expression of both myogenic and adipogenic genes. The mRNA changes measured in myogenic factors indicated atrophy/degeneration of the muscles due to microgravity. Downregulation of genes related to the adipogenic program indicated that degeneration due to microgravity may occur through different pathways than degeneration due to tendon and/or nerve injury in gravity conditions. Microgravity also led to an increase in collagen type III, a marker of fibrosis in muscle. Interestingly, effects were muscle specific; the infraspinatus was most sensitive to the unloading conditions in general, but only the supraspinatus showed changes in adipogenesis. Preliminary proteomics results indicated differential expression of a large number of proteins due to microgravity conditions. These changes included proteins related to muscle metabolism, muscle type, and fatty acid/glucose metabolism. <P>

The sensitivity of the musculoskeletal system to its mechanical environment may magnify the injury susceptibility of insertion sites during prolonged exposure to microgravity. Changes in loading across joints, as would occur during a long stay on the International Space Station or during a trip to Mars, will lead to changes in tissue mechanical, structural, and biochemical properties. Joint unloading will result in a catabolic biologic state and subsequent tissue degeneration. Physiologic joint loading, on the other hand, will result in an anabolic biologic state and maintenance of tissue properties. Joint deterioration during space flight would significantly increase the risk of injury to the tendons and ligaments which provide function and stability to joints. These injuries do not heal well (e.g., the failure rate for repaired rotator cuff repairs may be as high as 94%) and will severely debilitate an injured astronaut. The negative effect of unloading has most clearly been demonstrated in bone and muscle. Less is known, however, about the effect of weightlessness on joint soft tissues. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to examine the effect of prolonged weightlessness on the mechanical and biochemical properties of muscles, tendons, and their insertions into bone. We propose to study the tendon-to-bone insertions of animals subjected to fourteen to thirty days of weightlessness through the Biospecimen Sharing Program organized for the STS-131, STS-133, STS-135, and the Bion-M1 missions. These shared animals will allow us to examine joint degeneration due to weightlessness by comparing the weightless group to a control group on Earth. The studies will focus on the shoulder joint in particular. Outcome measures will include assessment of the mechanical, structural, genetic, and compositional changes of mouse rotator cuff muscles, tendons, and their insertions into the humeral head bone. These analyses will be performed on mice whose procedures and objectives were associated with the primary research focus of this research program. <P></td>

						Muscles, tendons, and bony insertions of animals subjected to 13-15 days of weightlessness on  shuttle missions STS-131, STS-133, and STS-135, were studied.    <P>
1.	The effect of microgravity on the rotator cuff tendons and their bony insertions: For tendons and their bony insertions, enzymatic degradation of the tissue by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is evident after tendon unloading and/or injury. Microgravity led to significant increases in MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression and significant decreases in tendon cross-sectional area. These changes led to a surprising increase in the modulus and strength of the tendon-to-bone insertion. The stiffer tendon-to-bone insertion may be indicative of early tissue pathology, as is seen in glycation-related stiffening of soft tissues in a number of diseases.    <P>
2.	The effect of microgravity on the humeral head bone: Joint unloading on Earth or in space has been shown to cause a rapid loss of bone mineral mass.  Changes in mineral are typically due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, resulting in decreased mineral content as well as changes in the trabecular bone architecture. It is likely that similar bony changes will occur at tendon-to-bone insertions subjected to a weightless environment. Preliminary data from the STS-131 and STS-135 demonstrate that bone resorption is increased (as indicated by increases in the ratio of RANK-L to OPG gene expression) and osteoblast differentiation is decreased (as indicated by decreases in osterix and Runx-2 gene expression). Bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) were decreased due to microgravity.    <P>
3.	The effect of microgravity on the rotator cuff muscles: Microgravity significantly downregulated the expression of both myogenic and adipogenic genes. The mRNA changes measured in myogenic factors indicated atrophy/degeneration of the muscles due to microgravity. Downregulation of genes related to the adipogenic program indicated that degeneration due to microgravity may occur through different pathways than degeneration due to tendon and/or nerve injury in gravity conditions. Microgravity also led to an increase in collagen type III, a marker of fibrosis in muscle. Interestingly, effects were muscle specific; the infraspinatus was most sensitive to the unloading conditions in general, but only the supraspinatus showed changes in adipogenesis. Preliminary proteomics results indicated that the expression of a large number of proteins was changed due to microgravity conditions. These changes included proteins related to muscle metabolism, muscle type, and fatty acid/glucose metabolism. <P>

						1.The effect of microgravity on gene expression in the humerus    <P>
Joint unloading on earth or in space has been shown to cause a rapid loss of bone mineral mass.  Changes in mineral are typically due to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, resulting in decreased mineral content as well as changes in the trabecular bone architecture. It is likely that similar bony changes will occur at tendon-to-bone insertions subjected to a weightless environment. Preliminary data from the STS131 BSP demonstrate that bone resorption is increased (as indicated by increases in the ratio of RANKL and OPG gene expression) and osteoblast differentiation is decreased (as indicated by decreases in OSX gene expression). Surprisingly, adipogenesis was decreased due to the weightless environment (as indicated by decreases in PPARG gene expression). As expected, the mechanoresponsive gene COX2 was dramatically downregulated due to microgravity.       <P>
2. The effect of microgravity on the rotator cuff muscles    <P>
Microgravity significantly downregulated the expression of both myogenic and adipogenic. MyoD is involved in initiating a myogenic differentiation program of multipotential stem cells and myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle development. The mRNA changes indicate atrophy/degeneration of the muscles due to microgravity. C/EBPa mediates transcriptional control of adipogenesis. Upregulation in its expression has been observed due to muscle unloading. Leptin is manufactured in fat cells and its upregulation suggests presence of adipose tissue. Surprisingly, we found downregulation of adipogenic markers, indicating that degeneration due to microgravity may occur through different pathways than degeneration due to tendon and/or nerve injury. Microgravity also led to an increase in collagen type III, a marker of fibrosis (and hence degeneration) in muscle. Interestingly, effects were muscle specific; the infraspinatus was most sensitive to the unloading conditions in general, but only the supraspinatus showed changes in adipogenesis.    <P>
  3.	The effect of microgravity on the rotator cuff tendons and their bony insertions    <P>
Joint unloading through cast immobilization or muscle paralysis results in a catabolic biologic state and subsequent tissue degeneration. For tendons and their bony insertions, enzymatic degradation of the tissue by the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is most evident as changes in the extracellular matrix; collagen fibers lose their characteristic organization and proteoglycans will be digested. Joint unloading due to a weightless environment led to similar changes, with significant increases in MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression and significant decreases in tendon cross-sectional area. However, for the time course of spaceflight studied here, the gene expression and geometric changes to tendons and their bony insertions did not result in statistically significant changes in tissue mechanical properties. <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Soft tissue injuries often occur at the sites of attachment of tendons and ligament to bone, the so-called "insertion sites". The sensitivity of the musculoskeletal system to its mechanical environment may magnify the injury susceptibility of insertion sites during prolonged exposure to microgravity. Changes in loading across joints, as would occur during a long stay on the International Space Station or during a trip to Mars, will lead to changes in tissue mechanical, structural, and biochemical properties. Joint unloading will result in a catabolic biologic state and subsequent tissue degeneration. Physiologic joint loading, on the other hand, will result in an anabolic biologic state and maintenance of tissue properties. Joint deterioration during space flight would significantly increase the risk of injury to the tendons and ligaments which provide function and stability to joints. These injuries do not heal well (e.g., the failure rate for repaired rotator cuff repairs may be as high as 94%) and will severely debilitate an injured astronaut. The negative effect of unloading has most clearly been demonstrated in bone. Less is known, however, about the effect of weightlessness on joint soft tissues. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to examine the effect of prolonged weightlessness on the mechanical and biochemical properties of tendons and their insertions into bone. We propose to study the tendon-to-bone insertions of animals subjected to either fourteen or thirty days of weightlessness through the Biospecimen Sharing Program organized for the STS-131 and the Bion-M1 missions, respectively. These shared animals will allow us to examine joint degeneration due to weightlessness by comparing the weightless group to a control group on Earth. Outcome measures will include assessment of the mechanical, structural, and compositional properties of mouse tendon-to-bone insertions. These analyses will be performed on mice whose procedures and objectives were associated with the primary research focus of this research program. <P></td>

                    <td colspan="3"> Musculoskeletal injuries are a common cause of pain and disability, and result in significant health care costs.  Approximately 30% of work related injuries in the United States each year are to the upper extremity. At the rotator cuff, tendon-to-bone repair techniques have been plagued by a high rate of recurrent tears, ranging from 20-94% There is little scientific basis for the current clinical management of this injury.  Regeneration of the insertion site of the tendon is critical for the restoration of tendon function and for the prevention of re-injury. However, clinical and animal model studies have demonstrated a lack of healing potential after tendon-to-bone injury and repair.    <P>
Musculoskeletal tissues are sensitive to their mechanical environment. Increased loading (e.g., through exercise) generally leads to an increase in mechanical properties, while decreased in loading (e.g., through immobilization) generally leads to decreases in mechanical properties. For example, bone adapts to its loading environment by remodeling its architecture to optimally transfer stresses. Unloading leads to rapid resorption of bone and a decrease in bone mineral density. Increased loading, on the other hand, promotes new bone formation and an increase in bone mineral density. These changes are especially evident at the bony end of the tendon-to-bone insertion. Understanding the responses of tendons and their bony insertions to a weightless environment will allow us to develop strategies for preventing tendon-to-bone injuries and/or improving the healing response of tendon-to-bone injuries for humans on Earth. <P></td>

						In order to study the tendon-to bone insertions of animals subjected to fourteen days of weightlessness on shuttle mission STS 131, we completed the following in the first year of the grant: an experimental verification test (EVT), protocol development for all assays, and sample collection after STS-131.    <P>
During the period from the initiation of the grant through the EVT (i.e., 8/1/09 – 11/15/09), we practiced all proposed assay. Specifically, qPCR was performed on mouse muscles, tendons, and bones. Biomechanics was performed on mouse supraspinatus tendon-to-bone samples. Histology was performed on supraspinatus tendon-humeral head and Achilles tendon-calcaneous samples. Finally, immunohistochemistry was performed on mouse muscle and tendon sections.    <P>
We completed an EVT on November 16-18, 2009 at NASA - Ames. This EVT verified that: 1) the critical tissues necessary for our experiment could be harvested in a timely manner, 2) the procedures were independent of the principal investigation and were compatible with the mission goals, 3) the tissues were properly prepared and processed at the EVT site (and by analogy at the KSC lab), and 4) the tissues were shipped in a suitable manner to preserve the integrity of the tissues. Upon receipt of the tissues to our laboratory after EVT, processing of the tissue indicated that we would be able to meet our science objectives.     <P>
During the period between the EVT and the shuttle flight, we optimized all protocols for tissue assessment. Specifically, we improved our methods for gene expression analysis, biomechanical testing, and histology. mRNA was isolated from samples of muscle, tendon, tendon-to-bone insertion site, and bone. The quality and yield of mRNA correlated with the time from animal death to placement into RNAlater preservative solution. We determined that samples must be placed into the solution within 20 minutes of animal sacrifice to preserve mRNA integrity. Histologic processing indicated that high quality sections could be produced using either paraffin or OCT embedding methods. Finally, we improved our biomechanical testing methods by: increasing the resolution of the local strain analysis, developing a temperature and hydration controlled testing enclosure, and improving the tissue gripping methods (and hence the overall repeatability).     <P>
STS-131 launched on April 5, 2010 and landed on April 20, 2010. 16 mice flew on this mission and 16 mice were housed at KSC to serve as ground controls. Left and right shoulders (humerus-rotator cuff-scapula units) and ankles (Achilles tendon-calcaneous bone) were removed from each mouse approximately two hours after landing, processed, and shipped to our laboratory.     <P>
We are currently analyzing samples for biomechanics (using tensile mechanical tests), gene expression (using qPCR), protein expression (using immunohistochemistry and Western blots), bone architecture (using microCT), and histomorphometry (using histologic sections). <P>

                    <td colspan="3"> Soft tissue injuries often occur at the sites of attachment of tendons and ligament to bone, the so-called "insertion sites". The sensitivity of the musculoskeletal system to its mechanical environment may magnify the injury susceptibility of insertion sites during  prolonged exposure to microgravity. Changes in loading across joints, as would occur during a long stay on the International Space Station or during a trip to Mars, will lead to changes in tissue mechanical, structural, and biochemical properties. Joint unloading will result in a catabolic biologic state and subsequent tissue degeneration. Physiologic joint loading, on the other hand, will result in an anabolic biologic state and maintenance of tissue properties. Joint deterioration during space flight would significantly increase the risk of injury to the tendons and ligaments which provide function and stability to joints. These injuries do not heal well (e.g., the failure rate for repaired rotator cuff repairs may be as high as 94%) and will severely debilitate an injured astronaut. The negative effect of unloading has most clearly been demonstrated in bone. Less is known, however, about the effect of weightlessness on joint soft tissues. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to examine the effect of prolonged weightlessness on the mechanical and biochemical properties of tendons and their insertions into bone. We propose to study the tendon-to-bone insertions of animals subjected to thirty days of weightlessness through the Biospecimen Sharing Program organized for the Bion-M1 mission. These shared animals will allow us to examine joint degeneration due to weightlessness by comparing the weightless group to a control group on  Earth. Outcome measures will include assessment of the mechanical, structural, and compositional properties of mouse tendon-to-bone insertions. These analyses will be performed on mice whose procedures and objectives were associated with the primary research focus of this NRA. <P></td>
